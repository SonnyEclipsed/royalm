Okay, so let me very quickly explain its significance. So as I keep on mentioning in this class, it is the religious worldview that underpins society and civilization. It is what allows society to function. And to oversimplify, there have been four major religious worldviews in human history. Okay? So let's go over them briefly. The first is what we call the animistic. And this is basically during the Ice Age when we were hunter-gatherers, and we were just roaming the earth. Okay? And there are three major keywords that underlie this worldview. balance, harmony, and oneness. We did not believe that we were different from the plants, the animals that lived on this planet. We were one with them, we were interconnected with them. We didn't fear death because life and death were part of the same continuous cycle. So this is the idea of the animistic worldview. From then, we moved on to the polytheistic. Polytheistic, many gods. And the three main ideas that underpin the polytheistic worldview are action, ritual, and fate. No one, not even the gods, can escape their fate. Our fate has been preordained. What courage is, is the willingness to embrace with honor and with dignity, your fate. So think of Hector as he is about to battle Achilles. He knows he is going to get killed. And he's afraid, he shakes, but he still confronts his fate and he dies. And that's what expected of you in the Viking world, in the Greek world, in the Roman world, to face your death with honor and dignity. To live your life with courage, action, but in a ritualized manner, okay? In a way that the community expects of you, and to embrace your fate no matter what it is. Okay, that is a polytheistic worldview. Then this leads us to the monotheistic worldview. The monotheistic, okay? So the monotheistic are the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims. The three major ideas that underpin the monotheistic worldview are faith, orthodoxy, and truth. There is an eternal truth called God. We must have faith in Him. And faith and truth are expressed through orthodoxy. There is a set of beliefs that you cannot question, that you must believe. And you must live your life according to this orthodoxy. Okay? So these are three major ideas underlying monotheistic. Now we move to the modern period. Okay? Another word that we can use for modern is diasm. Okay? Diasm. You may have heard of this, but the idea of diasm is that there is a God. God created the universe, but then he left us. He doesn't care about what happens anymore, because the word he created was perfect. And it is up to us to understand the perfect laws of the universe and then perfect our lives according to these laws, okay? So let's say if Dioism, this is important, because Dioism is the founding religion of both the American as well as the French revolutions. And there are three major beliefs that underpin Dioism. The first is reason. So rather than faith, we have to use our reason because that's the gift that God gave us before he left. We are able to using logic, using intuition, using skepticism to understand how the world works, reason. All right, but reason by itself is not enough. You have to engage in debate in order to fully Use our reason you may not able to reason out for yourself the truth But when in the debate you're able to hear out the truth okay, and If we do this if we continue to exercise a reason if we continue to engage in debate what is often called called the marketplace of ideas, this will lead to the idea of progress. Okay? So what's happened is that the modern period is responding to the Christian period by replacing faith with reason, or proxy with debate, and truth with progress. Okay, and these three ideas, reason, debate, and progress, are the foundations of the period we live in today, of a modern period. It is about these three ideas are the foundations of our school system for universities, for scientific institutions. Does that make sense? All right. Now having gone through these four different periods, I want to do some analysis. Okay? The first analysis is to explain to you how these changes manifest themselves. So the animistic period is the most natural. It's what makes the most sense. Quite honestly, if animals had a religion, it would probably be an animistic religion. So how do we transition from the animistic to apotheistic? Well, the main reason is because of civilization, okay? Because of mass society, civilization. Because we chose to settle down and learn agriculture and develop religious systems. All right? comes war, comes hierarchy, comes inequality. And as such, we develop the politic worldview. All right? From the polytheistic worldview, we then transition into the monotheistic worldview. Why? Because of Christianity. All right? Christianity. Remember, you're usually taught that Christianity is, oh, Jesus dies and then everyone becomes a Christian. That's not what happened, okay? As you learn in this class, Christianity was a mechanism developed by the Roman Empire in order to assimilate the Jews. And then later on to assimilate barbarians who were economic migrants into the Roman Empire. Basically it was a tool of control for the Roman Empire. Okay? But then you have this mass transition from monotheism, the Christian period, into modernism, all right? And this turning point, which is the most radical turning point in human history is what we call the French Revolution. Without the French Revolution, modernity could not happen. All right, and what's amazing about the French Revolution is it is entirely unprecedented. We've never had anything like this before. It was entirely unpredictable. It was unique in human history. All right, so we will show the next three classes to understand how the French Revolution happened. Because without understanding the French Revolution, you cannot understand future events, especially communism, the rest of communism, World War I, World War II. None of these things would have been possible without the French Revolution. All right, so another thing that's really important for us to understand is that all four worldviews still exist today. There are still people who believe in Anism, Partheism, but they're the minority. The dominant people are still the Monotheists, and they're in competition with the modernists, who are the educated elite. So this project is still going on today. The other thing that's really important for us to understand is, None of these beliefs is inherently superior to the other. Okay? You cannot make the argument to me at least that one is better than the other. But new systems believe they are superior to the other, okay? To the previous. So the polytheists believe they are superior to the animists. The monotheists think they are superior to the polytheists. And the deus think they're superior to the monotheus. And because of this sense of superiority, they try to crush previous worldviews. So these four worldviews are not in competition with each other, but the new ones seek to displace the old ones. And this has led to a lot of conflict throughout human history. So this is the overall framework we're working with. I know it's a bit simple, but for the purpose of this class, it's good enough. So now what I'm going to do is explain the framework for the next three classes. My argument to you is the French Revolution was ultimately a religious crusade. That is the main thesis of the next three classes. In each class, we will introduce different elements of this crusade that made it possible. For a crusade to happen, you need three different types of geniuses. You need the poet to envision the future, okay? The poet. But then you need the prophet who has the courage to take the people into this new land. And then you need the prince or the conqueror who has the conviction and determination to physically conquer this new land and expand the revolution, okay? So the poet is Russell, Jean-Jacques Russell. He wrote the social contract. We'll be focusing on him mainly today. He's the one who introduces the idea that it's possible to build a new world based entirely on reason itself. Right? That's Rousseau. Then you have the Prophet. The Prophet is the one who has the courage to lead the people into the new land, even though it may cost him his life. And this person, his name is Maximilian Ropes Pierre. Okay? Maximilian Ropes-Pierre is, in my opinion, one of the most misunderstood and underrated individuals in human history. Um, next class we'll focus on Ropes-Pierre. Without Ropes-Pierre, the French Revolution could not have succeeded. And then now you need a prince who will take the ideas of the prophet and he will militarily expand into the world and conquer a new world and build a new world and this person name of course is Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon. And this is the last class. All right and my argument to you today is that about the The active cooperation of all three, if they're not able to build on each other's work, the French Revolution would not have succeeded. Because if you just look at the French Revolution, the odds were so against the revolutionaries, right? They were not only against the aristocracy and their own people, they were up against the entire world. Britain, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Everyone wanted to destroy the revolution before it threatened their nations. So the odds were completely against the French Revolution, but they succeeded. It was only because of the cooperation of these three particular types of geniuses. Russo the poet, Robespierre the prophet, and Napoleon the prince. So that's what we'll be doing in these next three classes. So let's talk about the ideas that underpin the French Revolution, the Enlightenment. How do we get into the modern period where the ideas are now reason, debate, and progress? Okay, so let's go back to Dante. Dante's divine comedy is a prophecy. It is a new understanding of the world. So what the Divine Comedy does is, what it helps people do is take all these new structural forces that are being unleashed onto the world and understand it in a new way that unleashes three major movements, okay? These are of course the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Siamic Revolution, okay? Now, as these things are happening, what else is happening is the Gunpowder Revolution. The Gunpowder Revolution. And these things combine in order to create massive structural changes within European society. Okay, so we discussed this, but there are three major changes that are happening throughout this period. The first is a transition from feudalism to a nation. Okay, the idea of a nation. At first it's an absolute monarchy, but then after the transition it transitions into a nation state. Okay, from decentralization, just inter-centralization basically. That's the first major change. Second major change is from rural to urban, basically from agriculture into industry. Okay, and the third major change is from religion into science. All right, and this is what's happening in Europe because of the gun power revolution. Now what's important about this is with these structural changes comes massive demographic, political and economic changes. Essentially what's happening is that new groups of people are being created. And these groups of people are who we collectively call the middle class. So let's look at the middle class. So previously in Europe, there are just roughly speaking two major groups. There's the nobility and the clergy. There's almost no difference between the two because they're in a married, they're coming from the same family. But they're the linear elite of society. You have the tall people, the nobility and the clergy, and then at the other end are the peasants and slaves. But of course, this is not that simple. You always have a middle class, you always have tradespeople, you always have people working in towns, but they're a minority. What's happening now, because all these changes in society is they now become an increasingly powerful group of people. They're the ones who are driving economic change. Now, the middle class is extremely complicated set of people, but roughly speaking, we can divide them into three major categories, okay? Three major categories. The first is what we call the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is a French term that we use and it comes actually from the German, which is burger. Burger means the leading citizens of a town, the burgers. And the leading citizens of a town usually are the factory owners, the merchants, the people who trade, the bankers, the people who have control of the money, the lawyers. So these are the bourgeoisie, these are the elite. And this is a new group of people that work very closely with the nobility, but they have some differences. Okay? And the thing to remember about these people is they tend to be conservative because in terms of status, they already have all the status that they want. Okay? And what will happen is that the king and nobility will increasingly depend on the bourgeoisie for financing. Okay? So they pay for wars, they pay for a new industry, they pay for roads. Okay, so the board is the other ones who are most heavily taxed, but they're usually conservative They're really happy with the way things are at the other end Sorry next to the board of Z are we're called the petite one show Z all right, and these people are not rich but They're suddenly the middle class they're comfortable where they are okay, these people are school teachers Maybe they're restaurant owners. Maybe they're notaries. Okay, so So the thing about these people is that they tend to be aspirational. They're not happy with their lives, they want more. And as such they are opportunistic. Okay? Usually the people who are most likely to lead the revolution come from members of the petite Varsal Z. Okay? So most of the leaders of the French Revolution, the most radical members, were provincial lawyers. Okay? Lawyers who worked in small cities. They're not part of the elite, the bourgeoisie, but they're pretty comfortable where they are. They're the provincial elite. If you look at the communist revolution, Mao Zedong, he was a petite bourgeoisie. He was a provincial elite, not a Beijing elite. And the last group is what will be referred to in the future, not now as the Poletariat. Polateria. The Polateria are basically artisans, craftspeople, people who work in cities and in the urban centers and they have a specialized craft that makes them valuable, okay? They're not peasants, they're not poor, but the problem is they are very precarious, okay? Precarius. What this means is that as the Sannic Revolution progresses, new technology will start to replace the artisans, like a sewing machine. And as such, they lose their livelihoods. So their lives are very precarious. Therefore, they most likely tend towards violence. So these are the foot soldiers of revolutions. The petite bourgeoisie are often the thought leaders, but the polyterid are the ones who provide the muscle. So if you look at most revolutions, this is how it works. What's really important for us to understand is that, first of all, these categories are not strict. There are lots of interchange between the polyterid and the peasant tree, there's lots of interchange between the bourgeoisie and the nobility. These categories are not static. The other thing is that the loyalties of each group will change according to the circumstance. So the petite bourgeoisie is not definite that they will rebel against the bourgeoisie. It depends on their economic interests. And it is not definite that the peasants will work with the petit-portes-de-villiers against the nobility. In fact, during the French Revolution, this is really important, the nobility and the peasants working together to suppress revolution. Why? Because the French Revolution wanted to destroy the Catholic religion. The peasants love their religion. The peasants want it to be Catholic, and they want to protect their priests. So there was a massive civil war going on in France between the peasants and the Poleterians. And that we counterintuitive to you think is like, why would poor people be fighting against poor people? Well, it's because they have different religious interests. Does that make sense? So this is a framework that I want you guys to remember. There are different groups. This is an oversimplification. And their loyalties will change. So during the revolution, the loyalties will change and it will mark different stages in the French Revolution. And you can use this framework to also understand future revolutions, especially the Communist Revolution. And it's also important for us to remember that most revolutions will fail. So this is the middle class. Now think about the middle class. The thing about new groups is that what they have to do is they have to establish group solidarity. And the way you do that is by establishing group identity. So how is it that the middle class is different from everyone else? And as we discussed, what the middle class will do is they will slowly adopt the enlightened principles reason, debate, and progress. That's how the middle class, or most members of the aspiration middle class, will try to differentiate themselves from everyone else by embracing enlightenment. And that's why we have enlightenment. So over time, these things will become much more concrete. So what makes the middle class identity? The first is the idea of education. Second is the idea of achievement. And the third is the idea of morality. So what is the middle class? The middle class are those who embrace these three ideas, education, achievement, and morality. If you're in the middle class, you'll be much more educated than the ability and the peasantry. You will read books. You will read newspapers. That's what we have, newspapers, because the middle class wants information. Achievement, the achievement ethos is, I will always try to be better. I want my children to be better than me. If you're a president, you don't believe your children will live a better life. If you have no ability, you don't really care if your children live a better life. But for the middle class, it's very important that their children live better lives. So the idea of the achievement ethos, to work hard. So you guys should understand this because you're all members of the middle class in China, right? And the last is the idea of morality. And this is really important. Morality is, especially when it comes to sexual morality, all right? Sexual morality. So the idea is that if you're a poor person, the thing about being poor is you have no control over your body. So during this time of industrialization, what's happening is a lot of peasants are moving into the cities. And what are women doing? Well, they're becoming prostitutes. There are tons and tons of prostitutes in these cities at this time in Europe. We just walk on the street and guess what? There are prostitutes everywhere. So as a poor person, you have absolutely no control over your body. So with the middle class, the way that they differentiate themselves is by saying that we have enough resources to protect our bodies. And if you're part of the middle class, then you're expected to adhere to a very strict morality, okay? Does that make sense? That's where we get the idea of morality from, from the development of the middle class. As a middle class, you have sexual you are much more sexually peer, but also you have a new idea called childhood. If you are a poor person, your child age six starts to work, okay? At age ten, he or she may be working in a factory and by 12 may be dead. What the middle class can do is give his or her child a childhood, okay? The modern class of childhood comes from this period. And we're looking at this. Okay, so that's the idea here. The enlightenment basically was a movement in which a new group of people, They've always existed, but now they exist in quantity. And they have more resources than they used to have before, especially literacy, access to information. They have more wealth. They have more technology. They are the future leaders of the world. And as such, they want to embrace a new identity. And that's why we have enlightenment. Enlightenment was basically a period when they tried to bring the idea of science into society into society in order to create a new middle class identity and it still exists today. Okay? All right. So that is the basic framework for today. Now we will look at specific writers and thinkers of enlightenment. Okay? Any questions so far? Okay, great. All right. So let's start looking at some major thinkers of enlightenment. All right. So today's class is on the European Enlightenment. Now, what's really important for us to remember is that there are major ideological differences between the British Enlightenment and the European Enlightenment. European just means France, Germany, Netherlands, basically continental Europe. The ideas that develop in Europe will be different from the ideas that develop in Britain. After French Revolution, we'll look at Britain specifically. But now I just want to focus on the European Enlightenment. So please remember that the British Enlightenment and the European Enlightenment have contrasting ideas even though most historians consider them part of the same historical movement. All right, so what is enlightenment? It is a movement to systemize and introduce Dante to create a new European middle class identity. So all these ideas are coming from Dante, but there is a major difference that we must remember. Remember, the Enlightenment thinkers, what God left us is capacity to reason. For reason we can access the mind of God. Reason is the fundamental principle of the Enlightenment. That's all what Dante said though. Dante said, love is what God gave us. Love is the light in us. Now you think, well, what's the difference between love and reason? Okay, what I will do over the course of the semester is show you that there's actually a huge, huge difference between love and reason. Specifically reason is independent. You can by yourself reason out things. But love requires you to connect with someone else, either your child, your wife, your mother who knows, okay, but you must connect with someone else. And because of that idea, interconnectedness, it puts a restraint on your reason. But if you're capable of reasoning by yourself, you can reason anything, including concentration camps, nuclear bombs, genocide, okay? So there's a huge difference between love and reason. And it's really important that the Enlightenment thinkers see reason as a central organizing principle of human society and not love. So I just want you guys to keep that in mind as we move on. The Enlightenment happened mainly in salons. These are places organized by wealthy, watcher or see, women. And these salons were not political. They were mainly designed to learn manners, speech, refinement, because they're trying to differentiate themselves from the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry. And one way that they want to do this is through their education, through their knowledge, expertise, salons. In Britain, they mainly spread ideas through coffee houses. coffee houses. So the idea of meeting a coffee house comes from this period in Britain. So these women, like Madame Labard, were the ones who were driving enlightenment ideas. These salons were places for the leading intellectuals of the time to come and debate ideas. So these were the leading women of that time. All right. So there are lots and lots of enlightenment thinkers because this is a time of literacy, right? People want to read, there's a marketplace of ideas. So money can be made from writing books and that's where you have this explosion of ideas, the marketplace of ideas during this time. But now I want to just go through some of the major thinkers of the enlightenment, okay? The first major thinking of enlightenment is rainy day card. And René Descartes, he is a mathematician, he's a philosopher. He wanted to ask two questions. The first question is, how do we know that God exists? And how do we know the soul exists? These are the two questions that he is trying to grapple with in his philosophy. And he wrote a book called Meditations on First Lawsie. This is a really important book in development of Western civilization. We will be referring to this book quite often for the rest of the semester. So I want you guys to remember this book, Meditations on First Philosophy. And so he's asking these questions and let's read a few paragraphs from his book, to understand his thinking, okay? It is some years now since I realized how many false opinions I had accepted as true from childhood onwards and that whatever I had since built on such shaky foundations could only be hardly doubtful. All right, so what he's doing here is saying, okay, I wanna know if God exists, but first I must ask myself, what do I believe and how do I know if it's true or not? I must look inside myself, all right? Hence I saw that at some stage in my life, the whole structure would have to be utterly demolished and that I would have to begin again from the bottom up if I wish to construct something lasting and unshakable in a sciences. And what he's saying here is that after I examine my own beliefs, I recognize that most of my beliefs are not true. Okay, this is a radical departure from previous traditions where you know something is true because someone really smart said it. But you defer to authority, right? That's a practice we use in China where, well Confucius said this, so this must be true. And what Renate Descartes is saying is that, No, that's not true. I myself have the capacity to know if something is true and have a responsibility to reflect and question everything I know. And through that process of self-doubt, self-examination, I can construct something that is more truthful. And this is the idea of enlightenment. And this is the idea of education. When we try to teach you critical thinking skills, this is what we're trying to do. trying to get you to question things so that you may construct a more eternal truth. All right, but this seems to be a massive task, and so I postpone it until I reach the age when one is as fit as one will ever be to master the various disciplines. So to get to this point, you also have to go through a long process of education, okay? You just can't be like, okay, I'm gonna do this right now. You have to first learn these beliefs, and then you have to go back and then we examine these beliefs. I've delayed so long that now I should be at fault if I use up and deliberating the time that is left for acting. The moment has come, and so today I have discharged my mind from all its cares, and I've carved out a space of untroubled leisure. I was drawn into seclusion and shall at last be able to devote myself seriously about incomprehence to the task of destroying all my formal opinions. Okay, what he's doing here is saying that for me to discover the truth, I just have to rely solely on my reason. Not debate, not talking to others, not reading old books, but by self-examination, okay? And so this is the beginning of the book. We will read other sections later on in the semester, but this is the introduction, okay? So this project is a process of self-examination. And through this self-examination, what he discovers is everything is false. How do we know the sky is blue? How do we know the sky exists? We don't. How do I know that the words I'm speaking make any sense? I don't. It's a constant process of subjugation, okay? But what then he recognizes is that the only way that I can actually engage in this process of self-examination is through doubt. So what do I know to be true? Doubt is true. I doubt, therefore I am. You know the expression, I think, therefore I am. It's actually, I doubt, therefore I am. The Latin is, ca joto argo sum. The thing that I know to be absolutely true is my capacity to doubt. And that is who I am. Therefore I exist. So the capacity to doubt is my soul, right? Now how do I know that God exists? Well, if God didn't exist, then I would have I would not have the capacity to doubt, right? Someone must have given me the capacity to doubt and that must be God, whoever God is. But now how do I know that God is good, right? Because God could be a trickster. God could be the devil and God could be deceiving me and and my capacity to doubt will only lead me into error. Okay, so that's the question you asked him out. And then he says, well, because God is perfect. If you are perfect, you're incapable of fault. Therefore, I know God is good. Okay, and obviously this makes logical sense. This is not logical. It's what we call a tautology, right? God is perfect, therefore I know God is good. God is good, therefore he is perfect. It makes no sense. But what's important is that René Descartes is asking us to challenge our assumptions about the world, to doubt, to reason. And he's saying that the idea of reason is the most powerful force in the world. More powerful than a church, more powerful than dogma, more powerful than society itself. Our individual capacity reason is what matters. It is what allows us to have access to God. Doesn't make sense, right? So this is one of the major ideas underpinning the Enlightenment. All right, now let's move on to Gerda. Johann Wolfgang von Gerda. He is considered the greatest German writer of all time. And he wrote a book called Faust. Okay? Faust. And we'll just read a few passages from Phalse. But Phalse is also a very quintessential enlightenment work of art, okay? And so the book of Phalse, it's based on another book called the Book of Job, which we find in the Bible. In the Book of Job, it's about this very pious individual who is very faithful to God. Okay, he's very wealthy, he has a lot of children, he's very happy, and he's very developed. He prays to God all the time. He makes sacrifices to God all the time. He's very generous. He has a lot of friends. One day God is in heaven and there's a meeting with Satan. Satan in the Bible means adversary. So Satan is actually an archangel, an agent of God who roams the planet. And God is very proud of Job. And he says to Satan, have you seen Job? Do you see how faithful he is to me? He's very proud. And Satan says, God, he's only faithful to you because he's rich, okay? You take away his money, you take away his children and he will curse you. And God says, fine, I make you the spat. You can do anything you want to him, but you must not kill him, okay? That's the only condition. So Satan basically makes Job's life a living hell. All his children die in accidents, he loses all his money, he becomes infected with diseases, he's old, he's, and eventually he curses God. And he's like, why is God doing this to me? And then God appears before him and says, how dare you question me, God? I quit the world. What have you done in your life? But basically God calls him for a long, long time and curses Job and says, you as a human being have absolutely no right to ever doubt, to ever question me. I can do whatever I want. I'm God. I'm a mystery. Do not ever think you can understand me. Do not ever believe you can question me. Okay. And then what God does is he restores Job's health and wealth. Okay. So it's a very strange story. And it's one that is meant to inspire fear among people. And so what Goethe does that's really interesting is that he reimagines the story of Job and turns it into a much more confident, optimistic story that captures the spirit of the enlightenment. Does that make sense? The story goes like this. First, he is a professor. He loves learning. He's very curious. But what he recognizes is that, despite all his book learning, he doesn't really have access to the truth. He's not really learning new information, new knowledge. He doesn't feel as though he's accessing God. So he tries magic. One day, the Satan, and Satan's name here in false, his name, Mephessa Fleece, OK? Mephessa Fleece talks to God. And Mephessa says to God, you know what? The worst thing he ever did was allow humans a capacity to reason because you're idiots, you're stupid. If you're stupid and you can reason, all it does is confuse you and make you unhappy. And then God is like, well, have you met false? False is my favorite person in the whole world because he's curious, he loves learning. Eventually for the process of self-exploration, he will discover the truth. He will get there. I have faith in false. And my facility says, fine, I'll make you a bet. I bet you I can make him complacent. I bet you that I can make him not want to learn anymore, to lose his curiosity. And if I win this bet, then false will become my servant. His soul will be mine. I will damn him to hell for eternity. And that's the bet. All right, so let's look at some passages. This is my facility saying to God, Their lives would be a little easier if you not let them glimpse the light of heaven. They call it reason and employ it only to be more beastial than any beast. OK, what's important first remember is that here Gerta is invoking Dante, right? Remember Dante in the vine comedy says that love is the light of heaven. And here Gerta and the enlightenment thinkers are saying that no, it's reason that is the light of heaven. In fact, in many ways, false is a rewriting of the divine comedy. Right? So, Mephestri is saying to God, reason is bad because it makes people who are stupid more confused. And then God says, do you know false? And then Mephestri says, the doctor, the Lord says, and my servant, okay? My favorite person in the whole world. Mephestri, indeed, he serves you in a curious way. The fool is not content with earthly food or drink. Some ferment makes him want what is exotic, yet he's half conscious of his father. Fos wants to understand the world. He's curious. He's driven by his curiosity and his imagination. And Mephetsulis makes fun of him because he'll never get there. From heaven he claims as his the brightest stars. And from the earth all its highest joys. But nothing near and nothing far away can satisfy our hearts so deeply agitated. He's just too curious. He can't be satisfied. And the God says, Though now he only serves me blindly and aptly, I shall soon lead him into clarity. The gardener knows when the sapling turns green, the blossoms and fruit will brighten future years. Okay? So God is saying, if he continues to be curious, eventually I, God, will lead him into the light. Okay? So what's important for us as humans is to be curious. And that's how we show our faith in God. All right? Now, so, Mepheles and Falls meet. Mepheles says to Falls, listen, I know you wanna know the truth about the world. I know you want to experience the whole world, but you can't do it by yourself. So I will help you, okay? I will grant you the knowledge of the world. But if at any point you become complacent, you stop striving, you're happy with the way things are. you're happy with a moment, then you will become my servant. Is that a deal, Fals? And Fals is sure, because Fals does not believe that he can ever lose his curiosity, okay? So what happens is all these strange events where Fals falls in love with a maiden named Gretchen. And Gretchen falls in love with him and they try to have sex, but the mother gets in the way, So Falls has Gretchen kill the mother. The brother finds out and tries to kill Falls. Falls kills the brother. Gretchen gets pregnant and then has to kill the baby because Falls has disappeared. And then Gretchen basically dies in prison. So it sounds terrible, but what happens is that eventually Gretchen forgives Falls because Gretchen goes to heaven. And then Falls has more adventures. He becomes a servant to the king. He builds a lot of roads and a lot of cities. He marries Helen of Troy. He goes back in the past. Anyway, a lot of strange things happen. But what's happening is that he's experiencing life for all its potential, for all its possibilities. And so as he gets older, he's about to die. And professionally, he comes to collect his soul. And this is the last speech of Phos before he dies. A swamp lies there below the hill, infecting everything I've done. My last and greatest act of will succeeds when that foul pool is gone. So he is an architect, and he is an urban planner working for the government. He's a civil servant, basically. And his job is to make the city much more livable for people to help civilize the world. And he's seeking pride in his work. succeeds when I foul poo is gone. Let me make room for many a million. Let me make space for more people, not wholly secure, but free to work on. Green fertile fields where men and herds may gain swift comfort from the new made earth, quickly settled in those hills embrace, powered high by a brave industrial race. And in the center here, a paradise whose boundaries hold back the raging tide, And though it knows to enter in by force, the common urge unites to hold its course. So he's thinking pride in all that he's accomplished and that he will accomplish. He's thinking pride in this moment, when he's actually contributing to the betterment of civilization. But because he's thinking pride in this moment, he's now lost a bet to Mephysiphy, right? He's not become complacent. He wants to live in the moment. You can't do that. Yes, I've surrendered to this thought insistence. The last word wisdom ever has to say, he only earns his freedom in existence who's forced to win them freshly every day. Childhood, manhood, age, vigorous years, surrounded by dangers, they'll spend here. I wish to gaze again on such a land, free earth, where free race and freedom stand. So to be alive means to constantly struggle to progress things. And this is it. Then to the moment I dare to say, Stay a while, you are so lovely. He wants to stay in this moment forever. Through eons, then never to fade away, this path of mine through all that's earthly, anticipating here its deep enjoyment. Now I savour it, that highest moment, okay? In this moment, when he feels he's contributed to development of society, he feels at peace, he feels fulfilled, okay? And so the irony is that at this moment, when he's most fulfilled, he should not be damned to hell, right? But what happens as Mephethelites is what the claim for soul is, angels appear and steal it from Mephethelites, OK? The angels, pure in condensants, whom its flames blast, blissful of goodness is their existence, gather together, Rise now and praise. Spirit can breathe here in pure waves. So God has come to save false. They rise carrying away the immortal part of false. False soul is now in heaven. The Pharisee says, How then, where did they vanish to? You took me by surprise, you adolescents. Now with what they've salvaged from the tomb as their own prize, they've flown off to heaven. They've stolen a great and unique treasure that noble soul mortgaged to my pleasure. They've snatched away, with cunning even, but whom could I even complain to anyway, okay? So, my fascistly knows he's been tricked, but he has no say in the matter, okay? And so, false, it is considered the greatest work of German literature, and the main message is, God loves us. God wants us to be curious. God wants us to explore, to challenge ourselves, to grow, and we do that, God will always protect us, no matter how many stupid things we do, okay? God is ultimately about forgiveness and love and mercy and kindness and generosity. So that's a very optimistic and confident view of the world. All right? Any questions so far? Okay, let's move on to Emmanuel Codd. And Emmanuel Codd is the greatest philosopher who ever lived. We'll be spending a lot of time on Emmanuel Codd throughout the semester, okay? So I introduce you to him here. In the world of very influential essay call, what is enlightenment? Why do we have enlightenment? Okay? All right, so enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed knowledge. Knowledge is the inability to use one's own reasoning about another's guidance. This knowledge is self-imposed if it's cause, lies, not in lack of understanding, but in indecision and lack, Of course you use one's own mind, but with another's guidance. Dear to know, have the courage to use your own understanding is therefore the model of enlightenment. Okay, so what he's saying here is that you're students and I'm a teacher, okay? I'm enlightened because I'm using my reason. But you're not enlightened because you're reliant on my reason, right? And what he's saying is that it's not because you lack the capacity to reason, That's the problem. It's because you guys are lazy, right? It's just easier for you to just sit there and take notes rather than to actually read these texts for yourself and understand them yourself. That's where you rely on me, okay? But if you don't ever rely on yourself, you can never be free to think. It doesn't make sense. That's what he's saying here. Lazyness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly remain in my nerves or their lives long after nature has freed them from external external guidance okay you have the capacity to reason you can just read these things by yourself but you're lazy and you're cowardly okay you don't want you don't make a mistake you don't be wrong thus it is very difficult for the individual to work himself out of a knowledge which has become almost second nature to him he has even grown to like it and is at first really incapable of using his own understanding because he has never been permitted to try it. Okay? So everyone can do it, but only a few can do it. So what's the solution to this problem? The solution is free and open debate. Does that make sense? If you're able to access information, if you're able to access different points of view, then you're able to hear the truth for yourself. Okay? Does that make sense? So you don't want to find the truth for yourself, but if you're able to hear the truth, hear the opinions of others, then you can make up for your mind, make up your own mind as to what the truth is. And you can because you have access to reason that God implanted in you, okay? That's the logic here. It is more nearly possible, however, for the public to enlighten itself. Indeed, if it is only given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. There will always be a few independent thinkers, even among the self-appointed guardians of the multitude. So this idea of reason, debate, and progress. If there's a debate, if everyone is able to hear different opinions, then society will almost always progress. Does that make sense? This enlightenment requires nothing but freedom. And the most innocent of all that may be called freedom. Freedom to make public use of one's reason all matters. Now I hear the cry from all sides. Do not argue, the officer says. Do not argue, drill the tax collector. Do not argue, pay the pastor. Do not argue, believe. Only one ruler in the world would say, argue as much as you please, but obey. We find restrictions on freedom everywhere, but which restrictions is harmful to enlightenment? Which restriction is innocent and which advances enlightenment? I reply, the public use of one's reason must be free at all times, and this alone can bring enlightenment to mankind. He is arguing for absolute freedom of expression. Okay? Even if it's hate speech, even if you say racist things, you're still allowed to say it because people have reason and therefore the capacity to judge for himself or herself what is true. When you ever sense something, you are denying freedom to people. Okay? So this is an absolute understanding of freedom. And this becomes a foundation for, of course, the American Constitution or the American Revolution. In view of this, he as preacher is not free and ought not to be free since he's carrying out the orders of others. On the other hand, as a scholar who speaks to his own public through his writings, the minister in the public views of his reason enjoys unlimited freedom to his own reason and to speak for himself. This is a really important idea. So I'm your teacher. I'm your teacher. Now, I can perceive myself in different ways. I can perceive myself as an employee of a school in China. Therefore, I must be aware of censorship laws in China. I must be aware of what I can teach you and what I cannot teach you. I must also be aware that my main responsibility is to make you a citizen of China and therefore make you feel good about China, okay? If I see myself as an employee of a school in China, but if I see myself as a free individual in the service of human progress, then my job is to enlighten you as the possibilities of human reason, right? So I must be honest with you. I must challenge you to think for yourself. I must give you the capacity to, for you to think for yourself, okay? Therefore, I will not tell you what concepts I will show you our concepts so that you can by yourself interpret what he's saying. Doesn't make sense. Okay, that's the difference. You can either see yourself as an employee who is just making money in the service of others or as a citizen of the world, as a citizen dedicated to the progress of human civilization. Okay, that's your choice. Butchers of society, ministers, church council have the right to commit itself by oath to a certain, an ultimate doctrine in order to secure perpetual garnership over all its members and through them over the people. I say that this is quite impossible. Such a contract concluded to keep all further enlightenment from humanity is simply no envoy, even if it should be confirmed by the sovereign power by parliament and the most solemn treaties. An epoch cannot conclude a pact that will commit succeeding ages, prevent them from increasing significant insights purging themselves of errors and generally progressing in enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature whose proper destiny lies precisely in such progress. Okay this is a radical statement. What he's saying is that I'm of an older generation than you right? I have absolutely no right to tell you what to think. I have absolutely no right to tell you what to think. I can show you possibilities. I can argue with you but I must not enforce my ideas on you, because that would limit human progress. Progress is determined by a new generation's capacity to question and negate previous generations' ideas. Okay, does that make sense? All right, all right. So this is Voltaire. Voltaire, I don't really wanna spend too much time on, But Voltaire is considered a celebrity of enlightenment. He was very famous at that time, because he is what we call today a troll. A troll. Why? Because he's always making fun of the nobility and the clergy, the powers that be. And as such, the middle class basically worshiped him. They love his contributions. But himself was not a very deep thinker. Himself was not a great thinker. So I don't want to spend too much time on him. All right, so let's go move on to Jeanette Rousseau, who is the most influential Latin man thinker in France. It is his ideas that will drive the French Revolution. So he wrote a very influential book called Amil. Amil is his treatise on education. How should you best educate children? All right, so let's just read some basic passages. If the infant sprang at one bound from its mother's breast to the age of reason, the present type of education would be quite as suitable, but its natural growth calls for quite a different training. The mind should be left undisturbed till its faculties have developed. For while it is blind, it cannot see the torch you offer it, nor can it follow through the vast expanse of ideas, of paths so faintly traced by reason that the best eyes can scarcely follow it. So what are you saying here? And it's a very controversial idea. What they're saying here is that kindergarten and primary school make no sense. Kids come into school to learn math, to learn language, right? But the problem is that their faculty for reason has not fully developed, okay? It's like me asking you to fly, even though you don't have wings. So what he's saying is this, before the age of 12, let kids play. because if you ask them to come to school, all that will do is screw up their minds, right? If a child is crawling and you make the child walk, all that's gonna do is make the bones deformed, okay? It's gonna really screw up the legs. And that's what we're so saying. Do not ever send kids to learn anything before the age of 12 because their faculty reason has not developed before the age of 12. And guess what, guys? This is the idea of childhood, childhood. Children should be allowed to play until the age of 12 and it comes from your soul, okay? Doesn't make sense. Therefore the education of the earliest years should be merely negative. Negative just means like, don't have kids jump in the pool by themselves, okay? But don't be positive, don't make them learn mathematics. It consists not in teaching virtue or true, but in preserving the heart from vice and from the spirit of error. If only you could let the well alone and get others to follow your example. If you could bring your scholar to the age of 12 strong and healthy but unable to tell his right hand from his left, the eyes of his understanding would be open to reason as soon as you began to teach him. Free from prejudices and free from habits, there would be nothing in him to counteract the effects of your labors. In your hands, he would soon become the wisest of men. By doing nothing to begin with, you would end with a prodigy of education. That's a secret of education. Before age 12, leave the kid alone. Make sure he or she is healthy. Make sure he or she is eating well. But do not teach mathematics. Because by leaving the child alone, you free the child from bad mental habits. you allow the child to think for himself or herself. So the very idea of childhood comes from Rousseau. And this is an idea that a lot of middle class parents will adopt. I myself also believe very heavily in this idea. I don't want to send my kids to school before age 12, possibly even age 16. I work in the schools, I don't really trust schools. I don't trust teachers. It's like being a cook and you work in a restaurant. Like you would never actually go eat in a restaurant because you know how to make the food, okay? All right, let's continue. There are two classes of men who are constantly engaged in body activity. Peasants and savages, okay? There are these peasants who work the farm and these savages who run around and force all of it, okay? So you think there's no difference, but in fact there's a world of difference. And certainly neither of these pays least attention to the cultivation of the mind. Peasants are rough, coarse, and clumsy. Savages are noted not only for their keen senses, but for great subtlety of mind. Savages are really smart. Peasants are really dull. Why? Generally speaking, there is nothing duller than a peasant or sharper than a savage. What is the cause of this difference? The peasant has always done as he was told. What his father did before him, what he himself has always done. He's the creature of habit. He spends his life almost like an automaton on the same task. Have no obedience, have taken a place of reason. The case of the savage is very different. He is tied to no one place. He has no prescribed task, no superior to obey. He knows no law, but his own will. He is therefore forced to reason at every step he takes. He can neither move nor walk without considering consequences. Does the more his body is exercised, the more alert is his mind, his strength and his reason increased together and each helps to explore the other. The savage is an explorer. The savage is a problem solver. The savage is free and independent to make his own destiny. That's the difference, okay? So if you want to educate your child well then let the child be a savage and not a peasant. Oh man, seek no further for the author evil that are he. There's no evil for the evil you do or the evil you suffer and both come from yourself. Evil in general can only spring from this order and in the order of the world I find a never failing system. Evil in particular cases exists only in the mind of those who experience it and this feeling is not the gift of nature, the work of man himself. has little power over those who have thought little, look neither before nor after. Take away our fatal progress, take away our faults and our vices, take away man's hand work and all as well. If you take children out of school and you have to play by themselves, whatever they want, guess what? They become smart. They become resilient. They become educated. They become curious. They love learning. So we, if we try to build structure, if we try to build civilization, if we move children away from the state of nature, we can only screw things up. Schools are not designed to educate children. Schools are first and foremost designed to control children, right? Why? Because we don't like kids running around, okay? It's not simple. They're not meant for kids, they're meant for adults. So that parents don't actually see them and teachers don't have to deal with them. Okay? And so that's what Rousseau is saying and he's absolutely right. All right, so that was Emil. Now, Rousseau also wrote a really famous book called This Course on the Origin of Inequality, which will have a major impact on the French Revolution and Enlightenment. Okay? And it's the idea of private property. Where does private property come from? The first man who, having closed a piece of ground, he thought himself of saying, This is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the real founder of civil society. So we have society because some people want property, private property. From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind by pulling up the stakes or filling up the ditch and crying to his fellows, beware of listening to this imposter. You're undone if you want to forget the fruits of the earth belong to us all and the earth itself to nobody. What he's saying is this, suddenly one day some people in our society are like, oh, this is mine. This ground is mine. You can't come here. We should all been like, what are you talking about? That makes no sense. How do you claim this ground for yourself? Well, we didn't do that. In fact, we claim our own ground or we let them have their own ground. ground and because of this because of the idea of private property we now have inequality, patriarchy, war, okay? This is where war and patriarchy and inequality come from because of some people's insistence on having private property. Okay, any questions so far? Okay, it's all clear to you. All right, so let's move on to the final book, The Social Contract, okay? The social contract is the Bible of the French Revolution. It is the book that is the most influential in development of the thinkers of the French Revolution. The most famous sentence, the sentence that begins the social contract is, man is born free and everywhere he is in change. Here's one who thinks he is the master of others, yet he's more enslaved than they are. So we were born free, Or we choose to become slaves. But knowing that, the people who have enslaved us, think they are masters, but in fact, they're more enslaved than us because they are trapped by the system. You understand? Slavery is a system that enslaves all. It's not a system where a few oppress the others. Slavery is a system where an idea has oppressed everyone, especially the masters. We see at once that on this account of things, Certain questions can be laid aside. Whose business it is to make laws? There are acts of the general will. Is the principle of the law? No, because he is a member of the state. Can a law be unjust? No, because nothing is unjust towards itself. How can we be both free and subject to laws? There's no problem about this because the laws are nothing but records of our violations. Okay, so this is a really important idea that I need to explain to you. And it becomes a basis for a new type of society promoted by the French Revolution. All right, so Rousseau is trying to reason from general principles as to how to form a good society, a social contract where everyone chooses to participate in a society. And it's not compelled to participate in a society. And what he says is this, there are two types of will. This is general will and there's the particular will. General will is what we can agree on if we are left to reason by ourselves. Particularly will is what we believe if we are part of a group of people, a part of an interest. So let's just say for example, the central government in China is like, I wanna spend $10 billion on roads, on new roads. where should we invest this money? General will is everyone agrees that we should invest these roads where they're most needed in China, right? Maybe Guizhou, maybe Yunnan, the poorest parts, because they will do the most good. We can all agree on that, right? But because we are in Beijing, we will be like, no, you should put the money in Beijing. That's a particular will, okay? So in other words, society, if it is to function well, must be based entirely on the general will and negate the particular will on the common interests. And that's why everything works, because if laws are based on the general will, then all the laws are acceptable to people because the laws are just an expression of the general will. And the king, he's just acting out the general will. So the king is acceptable to everyone, okay? Does that make sense? The problem with this, of course, is that that's not how the world works, okay? There's actually no one in the world who is like, oh, I should do this because of the general will. It's always the particular will, right? Does that make sense? And so this is the major divergence between the French Revolution and the American Revolution. The French Revolution, it is fundamentally idealistic. It believes that people are capable of considering the common interests. The American Revolution denies this, okay? So we will discuss the American Revolution later on. And I just want you to be aware of this. The first solution is based on the idea of the general will, that everyone is capable of reason and of promoting the common interests. The American Revolution refuses to believe this. All right, each of us puts his person and all his power in common under supreme direction of the general will and in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an individual part of the whole. So as long as we are capable of reason, which we are, we can understand the general will. that the populist held its deliberations on the basis of adequate information about the citizens communicating with one another, what emerged from all that particular will should would always be the general will and the decision would always be good. So if you only think about the common interests, everyone would come to the same conclusion about everything. If the general will is to emerge clearly, it's important that there should be no partial society within the state and that each citizen should think owning his own thoughts, which was indeed, I'm continually astonished that such a simple sign of good government isn't recognized, or perhaps may do recognize it, but aren't honest enough to say so. What's the purpose of any particular association? The preservation and prosperity of its members. And what's the surest sign of their preservation and prosperity, their number, and the population growth? That's the sign you're looking for. Other things being equal, the unquestionably best government is the one under which the population increases most without external help from naturalizing foreigners or establishing colonies. The government under which the population shrinks is the worst. Over to you, calculators. Cald, measure, compare. This is a really important idea here. What we're always saying is that not only can we deduce good government from general principles, But good government can be measured. So we can know how we are doing a society through measurement, by measuring things, by counting things. Count, measure, compare. And that's what progress means. Now what we'll learn later on is this is actually a really dumb idea. But for now, I want you to be aware of this. And the French Revolution will embrace this. And that's why in the French Revolution, they will introduce the metric system. The metric system comes from the French Revolution. And the metric system is now used by every country in the world except two, right? There are two countries in the world who don't use the metric system. They are, do you guys know? There are exactly two countries in the world that do not use the metric system. They are, can you guess? These two countries that are most against the French Revolution. These countries are, America and Britain. Yeah, it's true. In China we use Celsius, right? When you go to America, they don't use Celsius. They use Fahrenheit, okay? And when you go to Britain, they use something called the imperial system. So just be aware, when you go to America, you will hear terms like, oh, 12 yards. And you're like, what is 12 yards? Okay? So they don't actually use the metric system in America. But whatever else does. But I'm wrong to speak of a Christian Republic. Those two terms are mutually exclusive. Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence. Its spirit is so favorable to tyranny that it always profits by such a regime. Genuine Christians are made to be slaves and they know it and don't mind much. This short life counts for too little in their eyes. So we're always rejecting religion in government. This is the idea of separation of church and state, which becomes a basis for the French nation state. It's a very important idea. And during the first revolution, this will lead to civil wars between the peasants who want to be Christians and the revolutionaries who want to establish a secular state. The dogmas of civil religion ought to be few, simple and exactly worded with no explanation or commentary. Its positive dogmas are the existence of a mighty, intelligent and beneficent divinity possessed of foresight and providence, the life to come, the happiness of the just, the punishment of the wicked, the second of the social contract and the laws and just one document of exclusion in the exclusion of intolerance, which is a feature of the cult, we have a rejective. So what we're sort of saying here is that the new society should now have a new religion, a state religion that is based on reason. And this new religion of reason must reject all other religions because these religions are intolerant of each other. And that's why in French today, there's so much conflict between, there's so much conflict in society. You have a lot of Islamic immigrants, and there was some conflict with the French state. Because the French state insists on secular religion, that the Islamists want their practice on religion, okay? Okay, so that's it, okay? So these ideas that we looked at will now become the basis of the French Revolution. So next class we will look at the French Revolution. All right, so I know this was a lot, but are there any questions about what we've learned so far? Excuse me? Why are peasants so loyal to the religion, right? Okay, great, great question, all right. Sorry, let me, all right. So what you learn in this class is that the Christian religion, it is something that is adopted, okay, or enforced, but over generations, right, over the centuries, becomes part of your tradition. So what is religion? OK, people. What do we know that people are loyal to? People are loyal to their home, their land. And that's true, right? People like being in a place. They don't want to move. Most people in the world don't want to move. If you give people a choice of Chinese, the choice of just moving to America, you think everyone would go. But no, no, no. Most people would not go because they want to live where they grew up. So they're loyal to the land, loyal to the family, then loyal to tradition or culture. They're loyal to food. This is true for most people. If you grew up eating rice, you don't eat potatoes, you don't eat rice. So what this tells us is that people are first and foremost people of habit. It doesn't make sense. Why? Why people of habit? Because this is a really important idea, okay? And I know this is a strange idea, but because it feels good. Do you understand? Because when you do something out of habit, you feel good about yourself. When you break this habit, you feel bad about yourself. And the only way that you know something is good or bad is how you feel about it, okay? Right? Like, you're eating rice and you're happy eating rice because you've been doing this all your life, but then, and now you're eating potatoes, and like, it kinda tastes weird. But I tell you, hey, no, no, eating potatoes is better for you. It's more nutritious, it's cheaper, you don't care, okay? It's all about feeling good. So you resort to habit, and habit is in the land, the family, the tradition, and the food. Doesn't make sense. And guess what? These ideas are all encapsulated in religion. Because religion is what determines your culture, your food. It's what your family practices. It is your connection to your family. It's a connection to your land. And that's why people will die for the religion. Because religion is really a metaphor or an encapsulation of all these things that people understand and know and love. Does that make sense? Okay? Now what you will learn in this class is people just don't die for religion. They also die for ideas, which include the nation. Right? The nation state. Because all that, because what you will learn in this class is what the French Revolution will do, is sort of process where religion becomes part of the nation. Or ideas of religion become transplanted into the nation. Okay? where people will also die for the nation. That's why you have these incredibly devastating wars like World War I and World War II where people will die for the nation. And they won't even think about it. But it starts during the French Revolution. Does that make sense to you? Great, great. Okay, all right. Good question. So how can a religion be based on reason? All right. So traditionally religion is given us to by God. Every religion is like well we have this religion because God told us to believe in it, okay? So so and the way you do that is through priests who then Tell you what to believe Okay, so this is the way that most religion is practice, right? What the enlightenment thinkers are saying especially who so is no no no this system doesn't really work, right because you have reason and and therefore you have the capacity to access God. So you don't really need priests, right? So we can just think reasonably what religion should be like. And from principles you can deduce the religion, right? Does that make sense? Now, if you just reason from first principles about what religion should be like, what are they? Well, first of all, there is a God, okay? First of all, there is a God. Second of all is that there is heaven and hell. You do good things, you go to heaven, you do bad things, you go to hell, right? That's second thing. Third thing is good people go to heaven, therefore you should do good, okay? And then fourth would be like, if you believe in these things, you are free to believe anything else. For example, you're like, I don't know, I believe that animals have the same rights as humans. Well, that doesn't contradict what we already believe. Therefore, you can believe that animals can go to heaven as well. Did you understand? So what we're saying is that, just from general principles, just because just if you're able to exercise reason by yourself, you should be able to deduce the basic principles of an organized state religion. And that's what he does in the social contract. It becomes a basis again for the French Revolution. Does that make sense? All right. Any more questions? Okay. Great, okay. So I apologize for the length of this class, but the French solution is really complicated, and I really need to explain some basic ideas to you, okay? So next class we'll do roast peer, right?"}

And so these people who start to conquer the New World are called the conquistadors, which is Spanish for conquerors. These are mercenaries, they're bandits, they're lower class people who have to leave Spain and Portugal and look for new opportunities in South and Central America. Okay, so some basic history. Remember that when we discussed the Islamic Golden Age, the Islamic Empire sort of connect the world in globalized trade and the networks run all the way from Central Asia over to China into Europe into Europe and even into parts of Africa. There's the maritime silk road that they create because they want the porcelain from China. They also have an overland silk road. And at this point in history, Spain, which is called Al Andusa, it's part of the Islamic world. And it is integrated heavily into the Islamic world. It's become very wealthy, very cosmopolitan because of this. This globalized trade becomes much more concentrated, becomes much more rapid during the Mongolian conquest. Okay? And because of the Mongolian Empire, the past Mongolica, a lot of knowledge, a lot of trade is being transferred from the east to the west, including paper, which is made in which was first invented in China, but also gunpowder. Next class we talk about the gunpowder revolution which marks a radical change in how the world works. Historically we have considered the Vikings to be the first to explore the new world. Remember that when we discussed the Vikings, they made it all the way to present a newfound land I found a collie called Bynan. But the collie didn't last very long. And that was the first encounter between the Europeans and the native people of North America. The thing that you learn in this class that's very important to understand is the world has always been interconnected in some capacity. It's always been globalized. So we can assume that even before the Vikings, there were some encounters between the old world in a new world. It could have been the Egyptians. It could have been the Harappans of the Innis Valley civilization. It could also have been the Chinese. Just because we don't have written records or archeological evidence does not mean that there was no contact. We have to assume that there was some limited contact between these worlds. But it's only under the 16th century when the old world and the new worlds begin to collide with each other violently. And the reason why is that Spain was eventually reconquered by the Europeans and it became Christian. And because of that, Spain lost its trade routes in the Islamic world. Also, at this particular time in history, the Ottoman Empire is rising in power. And what's really important is in 1453, they conquer Constantinople, which was the seat of the Eastern Roman Empire. And so now for the Europeans to trade with India, China, and the rest of East Asia, they have to pay a heavy tax to the Ottomans and the Italians as well. They don't want to do that. So their response is to discover their own roots to East Asia, to China, to these Indies. And they do. They hire a lot of these very experienced Italian seamen. So Christopher Columbus is from Genoa. He is Italian. And he was hired to go discover a route to China. And he ended up in discovering North America, basically. So all the major powers, France, England, Portugal, Spain, They are engaging in maritime exploration. Okay, and it's starting in the 16th century. What happened is that the Spanish will start to conquer Central America and South America. And they do so in less than 30 years. Okay, it's a very quick conquest. And so you can see that during the 16th century, there's a lot of exploration going on. There's a lot of contacts being made. The Portuguese already the first established the maritime empire. And so the question then is, why is it that the Portuguese end up establishing colonies in Africa, in India, in China, throughout these Indies? And the reason why is that the fear was that Portugal and Spain would come into conflict with each other. So the Pope divided the world into two. So the Portuguese got this part of the world and the Spanish got the new world basically. And the Spanish obviously got the better end of this deal, but that was the arrangement. Okay, so the Spanish got all of present day Mexico, Central America and most of South America and there's a lot of gold, a lot of silver within these regions, and as a result, Spain became very wealthy. Okay? Eventually, the British and the French will get involved as well, but because South America and Central America were already taken by the Spanish and the Portuguese, they ended up in North America, which was cold and poor and inhabited by lots of very aggressive and violent natives. And it turned out that in the long run, This would prove to be more beneficial for the British in the long run. But currently, the Spanish have accumulated all the wealth in the New World. So the main thing I want to remember is that because the old world and the new world collided, this marked a revolution in European agriculture. Because now the Europeans could import these extremely nutritious and easy to produce vegetables back into Europe. So the corn was invented by the native people of Central America. Corn is not naturally produced. You have to basically, simultaneously invented by crossbreeding different crops. Okay? It's a very long process and corn allowed for the man civilization to flourish. So corn is an extremely important nutrient that's easy to produce, cheap, and very nutritious. So is the potato. Okay? The potato over time will become the staple food of Europeans. So our peanuts, so our squash, so it's the tomato. Okay, so all these foods that we take for granted were actually first domesticated in the old world, which was then transported to New World. And because of these very nutritious foods, they're far more nutritious than wheat, you have population explosion in Europe. Okay? So this is very important. I want you guys to remember this. The potato, the corn led to a population explosion in Europe. And what did the natives get? Well they got a lot of diseases, right? They got a lot of measles and smallpox. So the question we're looking at this morning is how did a few thousand conquistadors Spanish mercenaries basically, how were they able to conquer millions and millions of indigenous people in South America? There are three main civilizations in South America at this time, the Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas. The Spanish were able to conquer all three major civilizations in less than 30 years. So how were they able to do so? That's the question we were looking at this morning. Okay, now the center explanation is threefold. When you talk to scholars, they have three explanations for how this happened. It was a perfect storm of three factors. The first is the native people were not in contact with the Europeans. So the Europeans brought with them these diseases that the native people had no immunity against. And the four major ones are smallpox, mesothiphyts, and Chlora. And this swept out about 80% of the population in North and South America. It was basically a genocide, okay? 80% is a lot of people. We're talking about millions and millions of people. Second major factor is that there were these internal conflicts, tribal warfare among the native people. And the Europeans, the Spaniards exploited this. They basically used a divided and conquer strategy against the natives, right? You first unite with a tribe that hated the Aztecs. You conquer the Aztecs together and then you enslave the tribes, okay? So that's a divine conquer strategy. And the third factor is the Europeans had superior weapons in technology. They had armor, they had cannons, they had horses. The natives didn't have access to any of this technology. So that's the three explanations. But if you ask the Spanish at that time, how did you do it? How are you able to, a few thousand soldiers, conquer this vast territory? And the Spanish would just say, because one, God willed it. Our God made us conquerors. It was a divine mission from God. Okay? And the second is we were so powerful that the natives bowed before us. They saw us as gods. That was a center explanation of the Spanish at that time. Because this is clearly a very racist attitude, we're superior, we are white, we're here to civilize you. Scholars have rejected this explanation. But what I want to show you today, and I know this is going to be controversial, and so please feel free to debate or ask questions, or point out inconsistencies in my argument. But I want to argue today that the original Spanish argument actually has much more evidence. It makes much more logical and coherent sense than the current scholarly interpretation. Okay, does that make sense? All right? So this is my thesis. This is my argument. The religious beliefs and practice of the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans made them vulnerable to Spanish conquest. So the ultimate weakness of these people was their religion. Okay? say this today in university because it's not really correct but I want you to make that argument because I think this is what makes the most academic logical and coherent sense. Okay that's my thesis to you today. Okay so a quick picture to contrast the collision of civilizations. Okay so the Assyk people, They're ferocious warriors, they love war, but they have wooden spears and they have no armor, okay? Whereas the Europeans, they have swords, they have shields, they have armor, okay? So this is a class of civilizations. All right, okay. So let's go back to the beginning of time. And one thing that you learned, we talked about before, is how civilizations arise because of three factors, right? Geography is the main factor, okay? So you want to be in a temperate climate. You need rivers in order to have civilizations. And you need natural boundaries like mountains in order to protect yourself from invaders, okay? And that's why the five earliest civilizations are all in this latitude, right here, okay? Right here. are China, India, the initialization of the rapids, Mesopotamia, which is here, Egypt, which is here, sorry, and the Mayan civilization. And what's amazing is that when you start to analyze all five civilizations, you will discover there's actually a lot of similarities, a lot of common characteristics among these five civilizations. Okay? Um, so yeah, so this part of the world, right here, okay? The Trapper Cancer. This is where all five civilizations first developed around this area. Okay, so the main civilization was one, uh, was just an astounding civilization. They had millions and millions of people. They spread all across Central America. They had science, they had astronomy, they had mathematics. a written language. They built pyramids, so these are all these temples to worship their gods. They had something called the Mayan calendar, and it's an astonishing achievement because back then they used 265 days. So it was the Egyptians who actually were first to use a solar calendar, but the Mayans independently also created their own calendar. And if you actually study the calendar, it's actually a very sophisticated, very nuanced, extremely scientific instrument that they use for agriculture. The most astonishing achievement of the Mayans was agriculture. And this is no different from science, okay? They not only were the first to invent corn. Okay, again, what's really important for us to remember is that corn is not produced naturally. Nature did not produce corn. The Mayans invented corn. And this was important because it allowed them to feed a large population with very limited agriculture. But not only that, but they figured out the most efficient way to use farmland. And this is called the Three Sisters Planting. What they would do is this. They would grow corn, bean, and squash together in a symbiotic relationship so that they're all helping each other nourish themselves and grow. Okay, so the corn will provide the structure in order for the beans to climb in order to reach sunlight. Okay, the bean will fertilize the corn and squash by releasing nitrogen into the soil. And the squash will basically prevent weeds and insects from invading this ecosystem. Okay? So it's a perfect symbiotic relationship that we're still used to that. And because of this sudden breakthrough, the Mayans were able to build a civilization of millions and millions of people. It was just an incredible achievement. Any questions? All right, let's continue. As we discussed in this class, all civilizations rise and fall. That's just a natural cycle. There's nothing you can do to prevent them from declining over time. Same process with the Mayans where, over time, because of their breakthroughs in agriculture, they reach a peak in about the year 780 in their population. But after they reach a peak, this is really important. There's a huge decline. And the thing that you learn in this class is that there are three. Sorry. So scientists have looked at the reasons for this decline. And what they've discovered is ecological collapse. So you have this huge increase in population, and this leads to deforestation and soil erosion. Basically, they're not able to grow farmland anymore, and that's why their civilization has collapsed. But the question then is, is this correlation, or is this causation? Do you guys understand? Because scientists will tell you this is causation. It's because they had a normal population, So they were using too much of the land, and so it led to deforestation and soil erosion. That's causation. But some other scholars argue it is correlation. And the reason why is that man's are really famous for their ecological management, their masters at being able to manage their environment. So this could be a correlation, not causation. So then what's a causation? OK, well, if we look at all civilizations, There are three factors that lead to the decline. If a civilization is prosperous, stable, and peaceful, guess what? Three things always happen. The first is the idea of elite overproduction, right? The Peter Turchin argument, which is that over time, you have too many nobles, you have too many elite who compete for status together. Okay, that's the first problem. Second problem is the idea of ratutopia, where all people live too long, And as such, young people are not able to inherit status. And this leads to a malfunction of society, OK? Because young people feel they have no opportunities. Same thing that's happening in the world today, where in America, there's something called quite quitting. And China has something called lying flat, pumping, OK? And the third is the idea of financialization, debt slavery. And the idea here is that if you're a very prosperous society, it's very hard to get people to work. because they don't really want material goods. All they want to do is have enough food to feed the family and they're good. Okay, that's why if you pay them more, they actually work less. So the only way you get them to work more is if you get them into debt, okay? If you enslave them. And that's what every civilization has done since the dawn of time, that's slavery. In order to produce, get people to work harder. Okay, this idea of financialization. So all three things are correlated. They are symbiotic. They work together. And they all spell the end of civilization. This is true for Rome. This is true for the Mayans. This has been true also for China, throughout its history. Does that make sense, guys? All right. All right. So as the Mayan civilization collapsed, people diffused all over Central and South America. And they brought with them the Mayan culture. because the man culture was the dominant culture of that time. It's like China in Southeast Asia. China is this huge sun that shines light on all other countries, including Japan and South Korea. And what will happen over time is that different tribes will fight over to inherit the man legacy. They will take, they will compete against each other in order to become the major empire. And the nation that eventually wins out in Central America are called the Aztecs. And the Aztecs are really interesting people. So, and they're very similar to the Romans. So if you think Aztec, think Romans as well. The main similarity is that both the Aztecs and the Romans are societies based on war. They love war, all they wanna do is fight war. Okay? So the Aztecs originally from southern United States, okay, well, southern United States, and because of climate change, they have to migrate to Central America for food. Problem is that Central America was already overpopulated and they start to hide themselves out as mercenaries to the other tribes, and then eventually they came into conflicts with the other tribes, and they became isolated in a place called Techno-Teclid, And this is basically a swap land. It's very hard to grow food in Teno-Teclin. Today, Teno-Teclin is called What City? Do you guys know? Teno-Teclin is called What City today? Can you guess? Mexico City, OK? So Mexico City, if you have a chance to visit there, it is actually on the site of Teno-Teclin, which is a city that the Aztecs founded. And remember, back then, it was all basically swap land. And so something miraculous happened. The Aztecs adapted themselves to the Swampland and they began to focus on agriculture. And this agriculture was very innovative. They turned basically Swampland into farmland and allowed for the populations to increase and prosper. So Swampland is bad because you can't really grow crops, but Swampland is good because it's pretty defensible. So they were able to very quickly expand their population. And so what did they do? Well, they started to conquer other territories because this is a war society. It is a heavily military society focused on war. The religion is to defeat enemies and then sacrifice these enemies to their god, who maintains his vitality through blood sacrifice. So the Essex were known for the most schooled task forms of human sacrifice. They would sacrifice thousands of people at once. They would also sacrifice you while you were alive. So they would chop you up and then cut out your heart while you were alive. And obviously the entire point was terror, okay? To terrorize your enemies and to unite your people. And what's really important for us to remember is that all war societies, including the Romans, the Vikings and the Aztecs, practice a form of human sacrifice. Okay? Remember this. It's very important. The Vikings, we discussed how they practice human sacrifice. The Romans also practice human sacrifice. And this is something that they sort of hid in their history. So the way they practice human sacrifice is at the end of every major military campaign, they would have a parade called a triumph. They would parade their war captives across the Rome. And then these war captives were taken to the Temple of Jupiter where the parade would end, and then they would be strangled to death in front of Jupiter. That's human sacrifice. That's like having him sacrifice. There's no other word for it. But the woman said, oh, no, no, no, we don't do this. We don't do human sacrifice because we're much more civilized than other people. and they never explained why the strangulation is not human sacrifice. Alright, over time, because the Aztecs were such a violent, aggressive people, they like the Romans were able to take over the entire territory of Central America. And they disobeyed allies. They were the main partners. They were part of something called the Triple Alliance. So three tribes that united against together in order to conquer the surrounding enemies. They were the main partner. The Aztec civilization was like the Romans extremely advanced. They had hierarchy, they had priests, they had universal schooling. So every child was allowed to go to school and learn to read and write. They had a system of courts and judges and they had a very strict legal code. They have a very vibrant economy. So this was a very vibrant civilization. And as such, their city, Tenochtitlan, grew very, very large. When the Spanish first came to the city, they were amazed by the extreme wealth and size and prosperity of this city. It made them salivate. So this is another shot of Tenochtitlan. Eventually, the Ascics were conquered by one man with maybe a few hundred soldiers. His name is Hernán Cortés, and he's an adventurer. He did not have permission from Spain to go and conquer the Aztecs. He just did so because he wanted to. He was a soldier of fortune, okay? And when he first arrived with the Aztecs, the Aztecs actually treated him very, very well. Okay, he was like a novelty, right? Yeah, he had weapons, but there's only a few hundred Whereas the Aztecs had millions and millions of soldiers. So they're king at this time, Montezuma welcomed him with open arms. And Montezuma probably wanted to co-op him, right? He saw him, Montezuma saw Cortez as an opportunity to use against his enemies and his internal enemies as well. Cortez just wanted gold. Okay, that's all he cared about, gold. So wherever he could find gold, he'd be happy to go. Okay, so, but there's a misunderstanding because these were two very different civilizations. So during religious ceremony, when the Aztecs were gearing up, Cortes' men saw this as a threat and they start to massacre these soldiers. And one thing led to another. We don't know what happened, okay, because the Aztecs were obviously destroyed by the Spanish. The Christian missionaries would come and destroy all written records of the Aztecs. And all we have are the stories that probably aren't true. But what probably happened is that the Spanish captured Montezuma and held him as a captive. They wanted to ransom. They couldn't get the ransom so they killed him. And then very shortly, they were expelled from the city. But then the disease of smallpox hit the population and all fell sick. And that gave time for the Spanish to recuperate and then eventually conquer the city with allies. All right? Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Now let's go to the Incas. The Incas. Also a huge empire throughout South America. These mountains are called the Andes. So like Marinday, Peru. They are on the highlands and they also had very advanced civilizations. One thing that made the Incas different from the Aztecs is they practiced form of answers of worship, a pretty extreme form of answers of worship. So the idea is the emperor is divine. If you're divine, it means you're immortal. So even though the emperor died, he's then mummified. He's mummified. And so he's still alive. And if he's still alive, that means he keeps all his lands and wealth. It doesn't go somewhere else. So now the new emperor comes into power, and now he has to conquer new lands in order to establish his divinity. So the Inca's are endlessly, eternally expansionist. They have no choice in the matter. And if you think about it, this is actually a good strategy to reduce internal conflict, right? Because this reduces the problem of elite overproduction. The old emperors, family, and loyal soldiers keep their land. And now the new emperor has to go conquer new territory, okay? So this results the issue of elite overproduction. But it also makes your society extremely unstable because it's too spread out and too many enemies, okay? The way that the Incas conquered other people is, when they conquer other people, their gods are incorporated into a pantheon of gods. Like the Romans, the Incas are extremely tolerant people. You can worship any god you want, as long as you acknowledge the supremacy of my god. So the pantheon of gods. So within the Inca Empire, everyone was allowed to practice their own religion, as long as they submit themselves and pay tribute. The Incas also had a very advanced bureaucratic system. They had a census, they collected tribute, they collected taxes, they had a legal code, they had a court system. What's interesting about them is they didn't have a writing system, but they had beads, okay? And with beads, with numerals, you can create basically a knowledge system. So this is basically like a very print of computer or calculator. What's left of the Inca is Machu Picchu. If you ever have a chance to visit there, it's beautiful. It's a hike. I wanna visit one day with my kids. Okay, the Inca's were conquered by another conquer student named Francisco Pizarro. Okay, the emperor who defeated was Atahua Pa, sorry, I'm not gonna pronounce his name properly. And what happened was that Atahua Pa had just fought a civil war, and now he's the divine emperor. And the legend is that Preservo fought a battle with Atahua Pa, Atahua Pa had 40,000 soldiers, Preservo had 200 soldiers, and Preservo won. and captured at a hua pa as a hostage. This story is probably not true, okay? What probably happened was that the emperor greeted the Spanish with open arms and let's negotiate, and the Spanish basically captured him. Remember, in this society, the emperor is divine, he's untouchable, so it is beyond his imagination that the Spanish would capture him, okay? Then what happens is that Prezoros said to the emperor, we'll let you go if you can fill this room with gold. And guess what happens? The emperor issues out a command, and a few days later, the entire room is filled with gold. Okay? So this place is pretty wealthy. Then what do the Spaniards do? What do you think? They kill him, okay? They kill him, and then conquer the entire territory. So that's why you should not pay rents to pirates. Okay? It sort of, I think Prasar himself was sort of astonished that there was so much gold. And then because could just fill a room like that, right? And then like, well, you know, if I can just ask for gold and they'll give it to me, then why don't I just take this entire territory? And that's what he did. Okay. All right. So another question is, how does this happen? How was it possible that the Aztecs and the Incas were defeated by just a few hundred conquistadors very quickly, okay, in a few decades? And what I want to show you now is the religious practice and belief system of the Mayans, which then influenced the Aztecs and the Incas, okay? Alright, so in the societies, religion is spread through all tradition, from priests to people. Okay? But fortunately, in about the year 1700, there was a Dominican priest who made it his mission to write down this all tradition. And this book we call the Popovo, it's translated into the book of the community. And it's just a literary form of the old tradition, the old religious tradition of the Neman people. So we're going to look at a few passages to figure out their underlying belief system and how it governed their society. All right. So this is a story of the heroic twins. So the Neman's worship, the heroic twins as the savers of humanity. So what happened is the twins themselves had twin fathers who were captured and killed by demons in the underworld. This is very similar to the Egyptian myth of Osiris, who was killed by his brother, Seth, and then sent into the underworld. And so the brothers want vengeance against these demons. And so what they do is they become their friends with the demons. And then they make themselves immortal, okay? When they die, they come back to life. And then they play a trick on these demons. They go to the demons and say, hey, look at us, we can play this game where we cure ourselves, we cut our heart, and we come back alive, okay? And the demons are like, yeah! We wanna play this game as well. And they all end up killing themselves, okay? So this is passage from the Popol Vol. Sacrifice in the same way said one death and seven death to Hanapu and Zalakuit. These are the heroic twins, okay? These are the heroic twins. Very well then, surely you will be revived. Are you not deaf? For we are here to gladden you, O lords, along with your vassals and your servants. They said, therefore, to the lords. Okay, so they're putting a trick on these demons. The first we sacrifice was the very head of all the lords, one deaf by name, the lord of Zimbabwe. He was dead then, this one deaf. Next they grabbed seven death, but they didn't revive them. Thus the babins took their heels when they saw that the lords had died. So they killed all the lords and then they killed all the demons. Their hearts were now taken from the chest. Their hearts were now taken from the chest. It's very important because this is how the Aztecs practiced their sacrifice. So they're trying to, with their rituals, they're trying to express or bring to life this mythology, which is what the Vikings did as well. Both of them had been torn open as punishment for what they had done. Straight away, the one Lord executed and not revived. The little Lord had begged humbly, whipping before the dancers. He would not accept it, for he had become disorientated. Take pity on me, okay? So this is how the parrots twins conquer and destroy all the demons. Okay, and the Aztecs will take this story, they will turn it into the basis of their religious ritual. All right, this is the story of the creation of the first man. What's interesting is that the man's believe that the gods made different attempts to create humanity. The first attempt is by making them out of mud and they fall apart, okay? So that's a disaster. Then they try to make man out of wood. And that doesn't work either. So then they try corn, maize, okay? And that works. So that's why the man can consider themselves the Trojan or the corn, okay? They worship corn as a metz divine. Okay, so the gods create man. And let's read the story together. Then the framer and the shaper asked them, what is the nature of your existence? Do you know it? Do you not look and listen? Are not your speech and your walk good? Behold now, therefore, and see that which is beneath the sky. Are not the mountains clear? Do you not see the valleys? Try then, they were told. So the gods created men, and they want men to be thankful. Why? Because the gods created men in order to serve them. So basically, the gods created humanity to be their slaves. Does their vision of everything beneath the sky was completed and they gave thanks to the Framer and the Shaper. And this is what men says to the gods. Truly we thank you doubly, triply, that we were created, that we were given our mouths and our faces. We are able to speak and to listen. We are able to ponder and to move about. We know much, but we have learned that which is far and near. We have seen the great and the small, all that exists in the sky and on the earth. We thank you, therefore, that we were created, that we were given frame and shape. We became because of you, our grandmother, and you, our grandfather. They said when they gave thanks for their frame and shape. Okay, so we humans are paying our thanks to the gods. Okay, we're showing our gratitude. The knowledge of everything that they saw was complete. The four corners and the four sides, that which is within the sky and that which is within the earth. Okay? So we now have knowledge and wisdom because of the gods. Now this is really important, but this does not sound good to the framer and the shaper. It is not good what they have said, they that we have framed and shaped. They said we have learned everything great and small. Okay? So the gods don't want our gratitude. They want our subservience. They want our obedience. Okay? And this becomes a basis of these religions where we have to believe that the gods created us in order to serve them. We are slaves to the gods. And again, this is very similar to the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation myth, where the god Murdoch creates humans so that the gods wouldn't have to work anymore. It's also very similar to the Catholic church, which believes that we are slaves to God because God freed us from the devil. Okay? This is the God Toehl, okay? Which is the Mayan fire God. And what they believe is that Toehl demands that we sacrifice our enemies to him so that the blood will rejuvenate him. Okay? He's a God of fire and of sacrifice. And he's always hungry. So the man's believed they always have to go to war to capture slaves, to be sacrificed, to their God. And there's a lot of mythology around this God. And this God has always demanded human sacrifice. So the humans decided to rebel against him. They tried many tricks to rebel against him. They all failed because he's smarter than us. So eventually humans decided to get together and to fight him, okay? But they all get killed. Thus, only a portion of them were able to return. Okay, those who rebelled, only a few were left alive. Only a few people from the nations were able to escape from Toehl. At first, they tried to flee. When they were caught, they were finished off. They were killed. It was not just a few of the people who died. And of those that did not die, the insects came upon them and tormented their hearts. They were no longer able to wage war. So the gods had destroyed our capacity to ever challenge them, to ever rebel. They did not take up their arrows or their shields. Again, that's all the nations were humiliated and begged humbly before the faces of Balam, Kitsa, Balam, Akka, and Mohakata. Pity us, you're not to kill us, they said. Very well then, certainly you shall become obedient. You shall be servants, as long as there are sun and light, they were told. Okay? So we can never ever challenge the gods because when we tried, we're all killed. And so the gods showed mercy to us. And so from now on, we must obey the gods. But now it's like, how do you obey the gods? What do the gods require of us? That's the question now. All right. We obey the gods through their priests who understand them. understand them. Does that make sense? So let's read. Kodkapa, Kats, and Kotoa were enchanted people, priests, and enchanted lords. Kodkapa and Kazuma were also enchanted lords. They knew that there would be war. Why? Because the gods tell them. They could see the future. They talk with the gods. It was clear before their faces. They saw that there would be death, that there would be hunger. They surely knew that there would be strife. There was an instrument of sight. There was a book. Paul of all was their name for it. Okay. So I think that's written down here. It's sacred because it was written down by those who speak directly with the gods. So I think all these words are the direct words from the gods themselves. But it was not only because of this that they were lords. They were great in their essence. Great as well were their fasts. In order to venerate their temples and venerate their sovereignty they fasted for long periods of time and sacrificed before the faces of their gods. Not only do the gods favor them but they themselves made many sacrifices in order to win the favor of the gods. They are worthy therefore we must submit them ourselves before them and that's how we worship the gods. Okay doesn't make sense. So think about this. The logic is very clear. The main credit civilization that is truly religious and hierarchical. Everyone, and those people, must worship their priest king because the priest king is the direct representative of God, right? But when you do that, you create the condition for the Spanish to come, kill that priest king, and become the new priest king. That doesn't make sense. That's what happened. The man's created this religion in order to enslave all everyone around them and that brought the perfect opportunity for the Spanish to come and take over that role. So in history class you may have learned that the Spanish were extremely cruel to the natives, not more so than the previous overlords. Okay, doesn't make sense guys. Alright. Alright, so what I'm going to do now is, having explained the history, I'm going to provide the theory, okay? I'm going to explain the theory of all this. But before I do so, are there any questions about what we've learned so far? Was this clear to you guys? The logic of this? All right, so let me explain the theory. Okay, so what you learn in this class, what we talked about in this class previously is the idea of game theory. Game theory. The idea of game theory is that all human interaction, it's playing a game. We may forget we're playing a game, but we're still playing a game. So if you want to understand how people behave, you first have to figure out how the game works, what are the rules of the game. So Samaria. The Samarians were one of the first earliest civilizations because they were based on the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia. And what happened was that they developed different city states along the river, the Euphrates and Tigris. And all these city states had their own city god. And these were all different. They all these different city gods. Over time, these cities came to conflict with each other because of trade issues, and also because of land issues. So they started to fight. At this point, this becomes a competition, it becomes a game. Okay? And whenever there's a game, there has to be rules that underpin this game. And the first rule of this game was we do not attack each other's cities. Does that make sense? Why? Because the city is the physical manifestation of God on earth. So you can kill the enemy's army on the field, but you don't attack the city. And also there are city walls to protect the city. And so what would happen over time is this game established as an equilibrium, where, OK, they fight all the time, but no one can actually conquer the other cities because these cities are protected by the gods. And so this is this which is an equilibrium. And this, this is a form of peace and stability. Okay. And there are like these elaborate walls governing warfare among the people of Samaria. Okay. But then you had one king named Luga Zackezi who is like, screw this. I'm gonna come and I'm gonna kill your God. Okay. So he comes, he sacks the city. Okay. Basically steals from the temple. The temple is where all the gold or the valuables are. And he sacks the temple, and even his soldiers are afraid that the gods will come and smite him, okay? They're afraid, but nothing happens to him. So he does it again and again and again, and he comes over time more and more powerful. Okay, so he's breaking the rules of the game. He hacked the game, okay, let's call it hack, or he cheated, whatever. But he figured out what the ultimate taboo is, okay? ultimate taboo and he broke it. If you break it, you become God yourself. It doesn't make sense. The idea of taboo are what humans must not break. What humans must not violate. Only gods allow to break this taboo. Only gods allow to kill each other. We humans must not try to kill each other's gods by ransacking their temple. And now once this rule is broken, What happens is, you allow a society called the Akkadians to come in and conquer everyone because they are the most war-like, okay? All right? So how is it possible for a different people who are much fewer and much poorer to come and conquer an entire empire? We discussed this, right? The Mongols. When you are severely limited in your resources, you have to use psychological warfare, all right? So the three forms are escalation dominance. Escalation dominance just means that you will do more than anyone else in order to win the war. It doesn't make sense. That's what escalation dominance means. Second is the idea of terror. So the Mongols were going around and killing people randomly in order to instill terror among the population. And the third is the idea of aura, of inevitability, and invincibility. You want people to think you are the demon, or the gods themselves. And that's how you get people to obey you. So the Mongols perfected the strategy. But the Akkadians also used the strategy, Sargon the Great, Sargon the second of our akkad. And what he did was he perfected siege warfare to break down the walls. Before it was thought impossible that you could break down these city walls, but he did so. And so this created escalation of dominance, terror, and the aura of inevitability and invincibility. Okay? Does that make sense, guys? This is how, this is often what happens. When societies are playing a game against each other, when they're in competition, they establish an equilibrium. Okay? The equilibrium is held together by an ultimate taboo. But then someone comes along and breaks this ultimate taboo, which then opens up the game. Okay? And whoever now is able to master psychological warfare, escalation dominance, terror, and aura of inevitability will win this game. Okay? Does that make sense? All right. Now that we understand the basic theory, let's apply it to the Aztecs. All right. So the Aztecs, sorry, had escalation dominance. They had terror, right? These are human sacrifice. And they had the aura of inevitability and invincibility. This is how they're able to control millions of people, even though they themselves had a very limited population. They employed the same strategies as the Mongols. The Incas also used these three strategies. And so you can just say that it was really about God. The Aztecs prove that their God will superior to every other God. Okay, does that make sense? All right. The problem now is you have the Spanish who come in and they don't know how the game is played. They don't, they reject all the rules of the game. They reject the idea that God cannot be killed. They kill God, right? They killed Manzuma, who is God of the Aztecs and they killed the Inca emperor as well. And when you do that, when you put the ultimate taboo, you leave people completely helpless. It doesn't make sense. So let me use an analogy so that this makes sense to you. In today's world, there is an ultimate taboo among societies. So China, United States can engage in economic warfare. Russia and Ukraine can engage in military warfare. These are not taboos. The only taboo is, no one is allowed to use nuclear weapons. Doesn't make sense, guys. No one is allowed to use nuclear weapons. Because if anyone used nuclear weapons, the world would end tomorrow. All right? So if you think about it, there were actually a couple of instances where we were very close to nuclear war, okay? During something called the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was very close, okay? But there was a chain of command. So maybe one guy would give the command to launch a new global offense. But then you have like 10 other people who have to say yes. And there's always going to be one guy who's like, I don't want to be the guy who ends the world, okay? So like I know there's talk about possibly Russia or the United States using nuclear weapons, okay? This is not gonna happen because it's the ultimate taboo. If anyone uses nuclear weapons, the world ends. It's like killing God. No one would do it, okay? But let's imagine 10 aliens, okay, 10 aliens. Just 10 of them. There's like eight billion of us, right? They come to Earth on a spaceship far away. They're out on the moon, right? They are not inhibited by this taboo of nuclear, using nuclear weapons, okay? Doesn't make sense. So all they do is use one nuclear weapon against us, and then what would happen, we would all surrender. Doesn't make sense, okay? Does that logic make sense to you? Same thing happened with the Aztecs and Incas. Because the Spanish were able to kill their God, everyone was like, what do we do now? What do we do now? We exist to serve God. God is invincible, but the Spanish just killed them. Which means what? Which means now the Spanish are gods, right? Does that make sense? So this is what happened. It's game theory. You're able to figure out the ultimate taboo and you're able to use it against the local people, then you win. And you don't need that many people. You don't need that many soldiers. You don't need that much weapons or technology. You just use it as an ultimate table against them. Because again, the thing that you learn in this class, which is very important is the worldview, which is basically religion. It's the basis of who we are. It is our operating system. that your computer cannot run about an operating system. We cannot run about a worldview and a religion, okay? If you destroy the worldview, it's like cutting off someone's brain. You turn this person into zombies and slaves. Does that make sense? So, the implication of this is, whenever society has extremely strict hierarchy, where the majority are forced to worship minority, it makes a study extremely vulnerable to invasion and conquest, does that make sense? All right, okay? Doesn't matter how many people you have, doesn't matter how much weapons you have, as long as you have a strict hierarchy, it becomes the ultimate weakness of a society, okay? It becomes, you become vulnerable to an outside invasion. Okay, any questions? This is clear to you guys, the logic of this. Okay, any questions? Okay, so next class we do the gunpowder revolution. Gunpowder revolution. And this will mark a radical change in our society structure. Okay?"}

So today we are doing the Holy Roman Empire Now last class we did the Byzantine Empire, which is considered the continuation of the Roman Empire in Eastern Europe. The Holy Roman Empire is considered the continuation of the Roman Empire in Western Europe. So the When we think about the Holy Roman Empire in the West, we think of the famous Voltaire quotation about the Holy Roman Empire. Voltaire is a very famous French enlightenment thinker. We will talk about Voltaire when we get to enlightenment. What he said was the Holy Roman Empire was in no way Holy nor Roman nor an empire. Empire. And this sounds funny. A lot of historians thought it was a joke, but what I will show you in this class is actually this is very true. So the Holy Roman Empire was started in the year 800 when the Frankish king, Charlemagne, was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in Rome. Okay? And this marked a turning point in Western history because this was really the first time that the Pope could anoint a monarch. Before it was the emperor who anointed the pope. Now it's a bit reversed. And this shows the supremacy of the Catholic Church. Historians have debated for a long time why Charlemagne would agree to such an arrangement. And so this is the topic we will examine this class. What motivated Charlemagne to agree to such a deal and what gave the Catholic Church so much power and prestige that they had the power to anoint emperors. Okay, so that's the topic we are looking at today. All right, so let's first look at Charlemagne's motivations. Charlemagne, his name means Charles the Great, and he is of the Frankish Empire. He was able to unite most of Europe through major innovations in the military. So he was the first to introduce the idea of armored knights which became the standard military doctrine and practice in Europe for centuries. The idea of the knight would also pave the way for feudalism in Europe. These are topics we'll discuss later on in the class in the semester. What Charlemagne is most celebrated for is the fact that he started something called the Carolingian Renaissance. Carolingian is the name of his family. The Renaissance is this period of peace and prosperity in Europe. And he's most famous for the building of cathedrals. He built 14 of them. This is the most famous. It's called the Ackon Cathedral in Ackon, Germany. You can, guys, you can still go visit it, okay? It is beautiful. The cathedrals of medieval Europe are really the pyramids, like the pyramids. They are meant to give people a sense of awe and unity. The cathedral was meant to bring heaven onto earth. One really amazing aspect about the cathedrals are the acoustics, the sounds within the buildings. It is designed in a way that when the priest speaks, His voice is projected all around the cathedral and the walls bounce the voice back. And so the parishioners, the people who listen to the priest, they feel they're surrounded by the voice of God. The voice literally enters you and makes you feel transcendent. It makes you feel you are moving towards heaven and that you are approaching God. All right, and these buildings are still around. So you can actually go and visit them. This is a picture of modern day, actually in Germany, where tourists go and visit the cathedral. Okay, so these buildings were designed to be eternal. Okay, so before I talk about Charlemagne and why he chose to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor, I need to give you a little bit of background about the geography of Europe. Now, if we look at the four major civilization empires of early human history, mainly Egypt, Mesopotamia, Innis Valley, and China, we will discover that there are three major similarities among all four. The first, as you can see from this picture, is, a lot of tritonally, okay? They are in the same place. They all benefit from temperate climate, which allows for year-long agriculture. That's the first major similarity. The second major similarity is these are all river civilizations, meaning that at the center is a major river surrounded by flatlands that allows for the production of agriculture. All right, so in Egypt there's Nile, in Mesopotamia there are two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, in this valley civilization is obviously in this river. In China, there are two rivers, right? There's the Yellow River and then there's the Yangtze, okay, the Changjiang, all right? And the third major characteristic that's very important is they're surrounded by natural boundaries, whether it's mountains, or deserts, or oceans, or seas, okay? And from this map, you can see very clearly these three characteristics for Egypt, right? Egypt has a Nile surrounded by natural boundaries, a desert, a Sahara desert to the west, these mountains then protect Egypt. And that's what allows unity to take hold very quickly in these civilizations and what allows this civilization to defend against outside invaders. The same is true in China obviously, right? Okay? So run it by mountains to the south, to the west, and to the north, and then the sea. Okay? So for most of its history, China was protected from outside invaders. This is all especially true in humanity's greatest empire called the United States. So if you look at the United States, it is a fortress basically. It's protected by two oceans and then mountains. But within the United States, it's serviced by the Mississippi River, which allows for agricultural surplus and which allows for trade and communication within the United States. So very early on, the United States could become very wealthy as well as unified. And it did not have to fear external enemies and therefore it could prosper without worrying too much about its national defense. This is very important because none of these three things are true for the European continent, okay, especially Western Europe. It's much too north and it's surrounded by lots and lots of mountains. It also has no major rivers. So as you can see from this map in southern Western Europe, it's mainly mountains and to the north there are flatlands but they're usually covered by forests. So for most of its history, Europe was divided and poor and isolated from the rest of the world. The other thing about Europe that made it distinct from the other civilizations is within Europe there are lots of natural boundaries and that's why Europe remained divided for such a long time. It was extremely hard to unite Europe. remember the Rome was not a European Empire it was a Mediterranean Empire that's a huge difference okay so throughout most of its history Europe was divided into different fiefdoms and the Prince the princess of the kings had a complete authority over their kingdom it was very hard to compel them to listen to your authority. Charlemagne had at that time the greatest army in Europe but even then he was still compelled to cooperate with the other kings. Okay so he achieved a lot of what he did through conquest but he also achieved a lot of what he did through alliances and treaties and friendships and marriages okay. So what What this means is, if you want to unify Europe, you cannot do so through military conquests. You have to do so through the idea of legitimacy. People have to believe you are the legitimate ruler. You cannot compel them. You must win their hearts and minds. And this explains why Charlemagne would want to be crowned by the Pope. because the Pope did have legitimacy, he did have authority, because the Pope was the leader of the Catholic Church. Now at this time, there were many kings, not all of them, but there were many kings in Europe who were all of the Catholic faith. Okay? So this is a map of the major cities of the world at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire. Okay, as you can see, most of the cities are located at a certain latitude. And to the north, which is where Europe is, there are not that many major cities. So at the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe was a divided, weak, and poor place. So again, please remember for the rest of the semester, these three factors, latitude, you need a temperate climate, You need natural boundaries and you need a major river. And this will allow civilizations to rise and prosper. The great irony here, of course, and we will learn about this later in the semester is, despite its disadvantages, Europe was still able to conquer the world. All right? And it did so because of these disadvantages. If you think about it, These disadvantages compel you as a people, as a culture, to be innovative to overcome these disadvantages. All right, and this is something that we will learn when we get to enlightenment, renaissance, and silent revolution, which we'll do very quickly. All right? The other thing about Europe that's very important is it was constantly being invaded. Look, if you look at this map, you will see that there are a lot of mountains protecting Egypt, Mesopotamia, and in this valley in China. But there are almost none protecting Europe from the steps. As we discussed last semester, the steps traditionally has been the most aggressive place in human history. People are always fighting each other for territory. These are pastoral people who need land to raise their sheep and cattle. And so they're always fighting each other. So what happens over time is these people are pushed further out into the borderlands. They're often pushed into Europe. So remember about the Yemtai people, how they migrated from the steppes to Europe and basically conquered all of Europe. Well, this process never really stops. So in the time of the Roman Empire towards the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, There's huge migrations of people from the steps into Europe. And they're being pushed out by a new, more aggressive people called the Huns. You may have heard of Attila the Hun. Well, he's all of that group. And they are extremely violent. And they have made major military innovations that allow them to outcompete others in the steps, which force these other tribes and groups into Europe, which is the only place they can go. All right? After the collapse of the Roman Empire, these different groups started to form their own kingdoms. Around Germany are the Franks. And then eventually, over time, as these groups competing against each other, the Franks will ultimately defeat them and expand. But this is a process that will take centuries through multiple kings and through multiple dynasties. But eventually, the Franks were expelled out from Germany and conquer most of Europe, not all of Europe, they will conquer most of Europe. And the process, what's interesting for us is they will make contact with the ones isolated Scandinavian countries, the Norsemen, they're called the Norse. We often refer them to as Vikings and we will study them next class. But now they're brought into the orbit of this new Frankish Empire. But again, and this is the Frankish Empire at the time of Charlemagne when he creates the Holy Roman Empire. But again, because this is not really an empire, it's more of a confederation. It doesn't really last much longer after his death. What's really interesting for us is to remember that these emperors, they are not born as emperor. They are elected by other kings. So again, you should see this as an alliance, as confederacy, where each king has voting power. Okay, so this is not a hereditary title. This is something that you are elected to. So after the death of Charlemagne, a couple decades later after his death, the empire splits into three. And even though on paper, this empire does last until the year 1806, it's a history that is extremely tumultuous. And there are some times when the empire completely disintegrates. But they keep up the pretence of having an empire. Because again, in Egypt, what matters is not territory or military or resources. What matters the most is legitimacy. And the idea of the Holy Roman Empire gives legitimacy, confers legitimacy, mainly through the Catholic Church. Does that make sense, guys? So we'll be discussing more of this as we go into the history of Europe. But before that, are there any questions? Sorry, are there any questions? So now what I wanna discuss is why the Catholic Church is able to confer legitimacy. What gives the Catholic Church the power and authority to confer legitimacy to kings and emperors? But before I do that, are you guys clear about what I just presented? Pope Leo III, yes. Oh, well, sorry, okay, so I'll explain, okay? But the Pope is considered the leader of the church in Rome. So he's a bishop, okay? We call him Pope because historically, Rome was more powerful than all the churches, okay? So I'll explain who the Pope is later on, okay? So that doesn't make sense. Good, any more questions? Before I continue, because right now what I'll do is explain how the Catholic Church became so powerful in Europe. Okay, that's a good question. So who are these kings? Well, most of these kings are actually hereditary. Their fathers were kings, their grandfathers were kings, and often related to each other. But they were controlled of a certain fiefdom. And you couldn't really conquer them because they had castles, and they were like in mountains. and they were a very aggressive people. So you couldn't really conquer them. So you needed to get them to agree to make you king. And so the way they did that was by having these elections where the kings got together, they called Prince Lectors, and they picked the king. And this is also true for the Catholic Church where different bishops would get together and they would elect the pope, okay? But I'll explain this later on, okay? Does that make sense? All right? Okay. All right. So let's go over the history of the Catholic Church and explain, understand why it became so powerful in Europe after collapse of the Roman Empire. Okay. First I want to present to you the official history of the Catholic Church as presented by the Catholic Church. So there was a man named Jesus who was actually a God. We didn't know he was a God, He was a God who came down from heaven in order to sacrifice himself in order to free us of our sins through in order to redeem us. Okay. Now Jesus had disciples. There were there were 12 major ones, but there were others. And after his death, Jesus reappeared before them and told them to to spread the gospel, the good news that he has freed humanity of their sins and that he will return to create a heaven on earth. So that's the good news of the gospel. So these disciples, they're illiterate peasants. They go all around the world and they set up churches in the honor of Jesus. These are the first fathers of the church. And these people are called bishops. So the bishop is the head of the church in a certain area. And the tradition is that the very first bishop of all the major churches, and there are like five, were disciples of Jesus. That's where their authority and legitimacy comes from, from Jesus himself. As the movement is spreading, Rome sees them as a threat. because Rome are pagans and Christianity is an anti-pagan religion. So there's a lot of persecution going on, but the Christians are armored by their faith and their love of Jesus and the miracle that is God. So they eventually triumph and convert all of Rome into Christianity. Now Christianity is the official religion of Rome And now they have the power to spread the message to all people around the world, but especially the barbarians of Europe and convert them. Okay? So that's the official history of the church. And there are lots and lots of issues with this story. I mean, the first issue, the major issue is how is it that a peasant religion was able to conquer the Roman Empire. There were certainly other belief systems that were much more compelling than the Christian faith. There's the Greek system, the philosophy of Plato. Paganism itself has many traditions. And as I keep on explaining to you in this class, culture is persistent. People do not wanna change their cultures. So it's a complete mystery how Christianity was able to spread and conquer Europe. And the explanation, if you talk to Christians, especially Catholic Church, is it's a miracle, guys. It's a power of faith, okay? That's the explanation. That's it. Okay, so there are lots of issues with this official story. So I want to give you my understanding of the history. I talked about this last semester, and I want to review it, okay? and applied to the context of the Roman Empire. All right, what's important for us to understand is during the time of the Roman Empire, the Romans had major conflicts with the provincials, especially the Jews, okay? Romans and Jews did not get along. In fact, they were often in conflict with each other. The Romans were pagan and the Jews were monotheistic people who only worship Yahweh and they refused to worship the Roman emperor, which was demanded of them by the Romans. Sometimes the Romans were tolerant and said, well, we'll make a special reception for you Jews, but some of them were extremely violent. This led to a series of wars in Judea between the Jews and the Romans. These were terrible, terrible wars that killed millions of people. major wars were fought. Another problem is that the Jews were spread all around the Roman Empire. So this is not a problem isolated to one poor province called Judea. This was a problem throughout the Roman Empire. Okay, so historians estimate that Jews accounted for about 10% of the population of the Roman Empire. That's a lot of people. In certain the Roman cities like Alexandria, it was a third of the population and there were a couple of riots in Alexandria by the Jews against Roman rule. Also, the Jews were as a whole a pretty cosmopolitan people who were well educated and who were very well established who looked down upon the Romans. The Jews had respect for the Greeks because the Greeks had a very superior culture. Jews and Persians went along really well because Persians are extremely tolerant people, but Jews really didn't like Romans. And the Romans really didn't like the Jews either, okay? There's stories of how after the wars between the Romans and the Jews, Jews were enslaved and sent to Rome. And the Romans released the Jews from slavery because they didn't like Jews. Okay, and Jews became traitors and settled in other parts parts of the empire. Okay, so the Romans and the Jews didn't get along. And so there's this constant conflict going on. But there are certain Jews, like Paul of Tarsus. He was a Roman citizen. He was very well established within the empire. And he got along very well with the Romans. He really much wanted to be part of the Roman Empire. And these wars were badly affecting him and his family and their friends. So there were a certain segment of the Jewish diaspora who very much wanted to assimilate into the Roman Empire. But the religion, the religion which believed that eventually a messiah who was a prince from the house of David, born of the house of David, he will return and he will lead the Jews to ultimate victory against the Romans. That's what the Jews believed as part of their religion. And so this presented a problem for Paul, of Tarsus, and other Jews who wanted to assimilate. When Jesus died, he became like a rock star within the Jewish community. And the fact that he died, the fact that he was crucified, which is a horrible way to die, It basically captured the imagination of many Jews. And after his death, there were a lot of people who started to flock to, they were very curious about him, so they flocked to his disciples. And so his brother James led his movement called the poor of Jerusalem. Later on they'll be called the apianites, okay? And these are the people who will influence the Islamic religion. But there were other groups who started around the idea of Jesus as well. So Jesus was a growing popularity in the Jewish world after his death. And in Jesus, Paul saw an opportunity to resolve this conflict between Romans and Jews. Remember, the problem for Jews is their religion believed that the Messiah would return who would lead them to victory against the Romans. And this is a problem because Paul knew that if the Jews united against the Romans, the Romans would probably win. Okay? So, Jesus is a solution because Jesus is a prophet of peace. Right? Jesus was a prophet who preached the importance of peace, mercy, and forgiveness. Forgive the Romans for destroying our temple. Forgive the Romans for persecuting us. Show mercy. Because what mattered is not what happens here. What matters is what happens in heaven. So Paul of Tarsus, backed by the Roman state, started this religion as a way for Jews to practice their faith about incurring the wrath of the Roman Empire, about being a threat to the Roman Empire. Does that make sense? Do you guys? Now, over time, as the conflict between the Romans and Jews became worse and worse, the Christian movement spread. And eventually, to gain legitimacy, they won the patronage of Roman patriarchs. So you had a certain segment of elite Jews and a certain segment of elite Romans who came together in the Christian church to build an alliance. Does that make sense? So in other words, the Catholic Church, the beginning of the Catholic Church, it was basically an elite social club for Jews and Romans to get together and to work together. Does that make sense? Now, what's important for us to understand is there are other Christian factions during this time. But because the Catholic Church, the beginning, the proto-Catholic Church, it's backed by the Roman state. And because of its organization and its wealth, was able to ultimately win out over the other Christian sects. Doesn't make sense. Now, over time, what the Romans recognize is, wow, the Christian church is great at solving the Jewish problem. And then they recognize that, oh, wouldn't it be good for solving all our problems? Because eventually, the Jews cease to be the major problem, And these barbarians coming in from the steps and from the north are the major problem. And there's just too many of them. So remember you have all these barbarians coming in. What's important to remember about these barbarians is this is not an invasion. An invasion. Often historians will use the word barbarian invasion. They're not invaders, they're migrants. It's a migration guys. What's the difference? Well, if it was an invasion, these people are looking to conquer the Roman Empire and instill upon the empire their worldview, their culture, their religion. If it's a migration, these people are looking for better economic opportunities. And therefore, they are willing to conform to your worldview, to your religion. So think about the United States, where on the southern border there are millions of people every year who are trying to get in the United States. They're not there to conquer the United States. They're there to microwave the United States and seek a better life. And they know that if they are to succeed the United States, they must assimilate. Okay? And the best way to assimilate the United States of course is to go to university, right? Because once you're part of the university, you're now part of the social elite. That's the best thing to do. But a lot of people don't have the wealth, the education to go to university. So what they often do is join the church, the church. If you look at these 100,000, these millions of Chinese students who have gone to United States, the group that has assimilated the best are Chinese Christians, right? These are Chinese who are either practicing Christians or they convert to Christianity when they go to United States. Because when they're Christians, there's an immediate social community for them that welcomes them and supports them. Does that make sense, guys? All right, so this is United States. But this was two during the late Roman Empire as well. Okay? You have all these barbarians, they're called barbarians, and they're coming in and they're trying to assimilate. And the Roman Empire needs to assimilate them as well. And what they discovered is the best way to do that is through the Catholic Church, right? Because remember, these barbarians, they are pagans. They worship war, they worship violence. They're a problem in the long term. But they convert to Christianity, which is a religion that preaches peace, mercy, forgiveness, kindness, then they're easier to manage. And what happens is that a lot do convert. Now, some of you may say, well, this sounds very cynical. These people are changing their religion and they're doing so for their own material benefit. Okay, what's important for us to understand is that if you look at any religion, if you go to any church, you will find that the people who most believe in this religion, who are the most fanatical about this religion are new converts. Does that make sense? If you're born into this religion, if your parents are Christians, you take it for granted, okay? And you are often dubious and skeptical because children like to rebel against their parents. But if you convert to Christianity, if you do start out of your own choice, well, then you are fully committed now, okay? And this is because of a psychological principle called the sunk cost fallacy. To turn to a new religion means to give up your community, your traditions, your history, your sense of identity. And because of all this, you are stuck with this new religion. Whether or not you truly believe it or not. And because of that, because of the sunk cost fallacy, because you have lost so much in the process, You are now fully committed to the religion. You are so fanatical that you not only convert, but you want to convert others as well. Okay, does that make sense? So with the barbarian invasions, the Catholic Church experiences tremendous growth because now they are letting in lots of converts who are fanatical about the new religion. All right? The church is also a mechanism of social mobility for the barbarians because Roman society it's very parochial. It's very close-minded. It doesn't like foreigners, okay? But traditionally in human history, the church and the military were the two major mechanisms of social mobility. If you're an outsider and you want to rise in society, you either join a church or you join a military. And this has been true in Europe for hundreds of years. The last thing about the church that's very important is, in trying to co-op new people, it recognizes that it must first co-op the elite. Now, barbarians, they do not have, or most barbarians do not have a concept of a hereditary elite. They're leaders, often people who are elected for the moment. Okay? So it's possible to switch leaders if the leaders aren't performing a good job. What the church does is, in exchange for joining the church, the church can make these leaders, who again are only temporary, into a hereditary elite. Meaning there are advantages and social status will pass on to the children. Which is an extremely appealing deal for these barbarian leaders, okay? Does that make sense? All right, so as the barbarians keep on migrating to Rome, the Catholic Church is the main mechanism that absorbs them, okay? Also the military as well. So it's a military and a church of the Roman Empire that mainly absorbs them. And this, and because of this idea, the church is a mechanism which allows you to join the Roman Empire, the church acquires tremendous legitimacy and prestige and status. Does that make sense for you guys? But in this system, local churches have local autonomy because you're trying to let in local elites. If you let in local elites, you have to give them autonomy. And towards the end of the Roman Empire, there are five major churches that rule collectively. The major church is in Rome. Okay, again, the leaders of these churches are called bishops. There's Rome, there's Constantinople, there is Antioch, there's Alexandria, and these are the four major population centers of the Roman Empire. And then of course there is Jerusalem. And Jerusalem is part of this five because of its prestige, right? This is where Jesus died. And this is where the Jewish and Christian religions were born, okay? So, from most of the obvious history, these are five major churches. And for most of this history, they are independent of each other. There are other churches and other places as well that are also extremely independent of each other. Meaning they were allowed to, within the Christian framework, give up their own doctrine and practices. But it was understood the primary church was Rome, because Rome was the center, the capital of the Roman Empire. And because of this, the bishop here is called the Pope in order to distinguish him from the other bishops. Does that make sense? All right? The problem with this system is that the capital in 330 switches from Rome over to Constantinople. And over time, the Constantinople would church, because it is now the capital, it wants to assert its authority over the other churches, mainly through the idea of orthodoxy, right? orthodoxy or doctrine. Remember, for most of this history, each local church is free to create its own ideology within the Christian framework, mainly because no one's in a position to enforce doctrine on others. Now, Casino Paul, because it's the capital of the empire, it wants to impose orthodoxy on others. And this is what leads to the idea of the Nicene Creed. Remember the Nicene Creed is the idea of the Holy Trinity. And at this time, when the Nicene Creed is first formulated, most people, most churches do not buy into the Nicene Creed. They do not buy into the Holy Trinity. But Constantinople sees the power of the Catholic Church as a source of its legitimacy. Therefore, it will over the decades embark on military expeditions to enforce Nisim Kri on all the centers. And eventually Nisim Kri will triumph over other doctrine. So the Catholic Church is able to build a legitimacy and power by imposing orthodoxy. But over time, as we know, the Byzantine Empire will decline in power and prestige, mainly because the Byzantine Empire, the militarily is not as strong as it used to be. And at this point, the Classical Church is declining other churches, especially in Rome. They want now to assert their local autonomy. So this created a major controversy called iconoclasm. Iconoclasm. Iconoclasm just means that Constantinople believes that God should not be celebrated in images. You cannot paint God, you cannot paint Jesus. Okay? And the church in Rome, the pope saw this as an opportunity to push back because this was actually a very unpopular decree. And this created a major conflict between Rome and Constantinople. And what this iconoclasm debate shows us is that Rome wants to maintain its independence. it's independence. Not only does Rome want to maintain its independence, it wants to regain its lost authority. And that's why when Charlemagne comes along, the church sees Charlemagne as the perfect opportunity to reassert its dominance. Dominance over the idea of legitimacy. And so they work together to create the idea the Holy Roman Empire as a competitor to the Byzantine Empire and as a mechanism in order to ensure the legitimacy and the prestige of the Catholic Church in Rome against that of its competing churches, mainly in Constantinople, but also in places like Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. And this will eventually climax in something called the great schism, the great schism. We'll study this later on. The idea of the great schism, which happens around 1,000, is that these two churches, Rome and Constantinople, permanently break off. They refuse to acknowledge each other before they would have meetings and they would share doctrine, but now they absolutely refuse to talk to each other. Rome will become the basis of the Catholic Church, Catholic means universal, which is still around today, and which is believed by about one-done people. Pasadipal becomes the basis of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, which is believed by about 230 million people, mainly in Eastern Europe. So if you're Western Europe, you're Catholic, sorry, if you're Eastern Europe, you're Orthodox, if you're Western Europe, you're Catholic. Does that make sense, guys? And at first, look, there's only one major doctrinal difference between Rome and Constantinople. Rome asserts that the pope is the first among equals. So the pope has the ultimate authority. The pope is a true representative of God on earth. Everyone else is lesser than the pope. Whereas the Orthodox Church asserts that all the churches are equal to each other, there's no higher authority. But later on, because the church in Rome will experience the Protestant Reformation, then their doctrine will rather be diverged over time. Doesn't make sense. Any questions about this? Okay, so let's summarize, okay? Let's go back to their 800 when Charlemagne, he's in St. Peter's Basilica, and he's been crowned Holy Woman Empire by Leo III. Why does this happen, okay? And let's look at it from the perspective of Charlemagne, as well as Pope Leo III, all right? So for Charlemagne, it's, The three major reasons are legitimacy, unity, and differentiation. And this has been true for kings throughout human history. Okay? Why did King David sponsor the writing of the Bible for these three reasons? Why did Augustus Caesar sponsor the writing of the Iniath for these three reasons? Okay? Legitimacy on the rightful king because God said so. Unity, we're all part of the community of God, and that's what difference is. Differences, we're Christians, and everyone else is pagan or infidel or heretic. Differentiation, we are not the Byzantine Empire. Okay? So Charlemagne is trying to create legitimacy, unity and differentiation with the Holy Roman Empire. So Pope Leo, why does he sponsor Charlemagne? Why is he crowning Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Empire? Well, he's trying to assert his authority, right? He's trying to establish the fact that the pope is a true representative of God on Earth. Okay? Second is he's trying to protect himself. So you guys don't know this, but in this world, there's no central power and the Pope is elected by other bishops. But in this process, you'll always have a faction who refuses to accept the authority of the Pope and this will lead to civil conflict. So before Pope Leo made Charlemagne emperor, he was also almost assassinated by his enemies. So by making Charlemagne the Holy Roman Emperor, he's actually appealing to Charlemagne for military protection against his enemies. So there's a lot of politics within the Catholic Church which still persists today. And of course, differentiation, okay? Or competition, sorry, competition. The idea is that the Catholic Church is in constant, the Catholic Church in Rome is in constant conflict with that in Byzantine. Both the Byzantine Empire and the Catholic Church in Rome are trying to assert that they are the legitimate here's to the Roman Empire. Okay, and obviously, Byzantine has a better case than Rome. And that's why Pope Leo feels compelled to create the idea of the Holy Roman Empire. All right? What I wanna show you also, that the idea of the Holy Roman Empire comes from Augustine. Okay? One thing that you will learn in this class, that's very different from other history class you will take. It's a power of ideas. You're taught usually that it's economics, or power, or kings that move history. You're taught in this class, and this is very important, it's ideas that move history. Let me show you how. Augustine wrote a book called City of God, which is what we read last semester, or parts of it last semester. We discussed it. What is the city of God? Well, Augustine, he's basically a high leader of the church. He's Bishop of Hippo, which is in northern Africa. And he's a problem, because in year 410, Rome is sacked. And there's only a few, a couple of decades after Christianity is made the official religion of the Roman Empire. Now Rome is sacked by the Goths, by barbarians, who are pagans. And so what a lot of people start to believe is that the pagan gods are enacting revenge, vengeance against Rome for disavowing them. In other words, the Christian god is the false god, the pagan gods are the true gods. And this historical event where Rome is sacked, it's so traumatizing that people start to believe this. So Augustine feels compelled to write the city of God to explain the sack and why Christianity is a true faith. In the city of God, Augustine says, there are two cities. There's a city of man of empire called Rome. Rome is a place where people pursue power, where kings try to outdo each other. Then there's Jerusalem, okay? Jerusalem, which is the city of God. And this is metaphorical. Rome is temporal. It is in time. It is off earth. But Jerusalem is heaven itself. And in heaven, it's a spiritual place where people practice their faith, their devotion to God. And that is what we should be pursuing. OK? So Rome is trying to create the end of history, meaning that it is trying to create an eternal peace, right? What is called the Pax Romana. The emperors are trying to be the ultimate emperor of humanity. But Jerusalem means out of history. You are taking yourself out of human affairs because the human affairs don't really matter. What matters is spiritual faith. Because only spiritual faith will give you salvation and redemption. And that's what matters. Okay? So our mission is to create Jerusalem. And that's what the Catholic Church does. The Catholic Church is the city of God. It's the new Jerusalem. It's what allows humanity to step out of history and to celebrate God on earth. Okay? And the city of God, in other words, becomes the basis of the Holy Roman Empire. In other words, Charlemagne and Leo worked together to create the Holy Roman Empire in order to achieve Augustine's vision of heaven on earth. The state of God was, it's an essential blueprint for the Holy Roman Empire. Okay, does that make sense guys? In fact, what's really interesting is, Charlemagne, who apparently was illiterate, I'm not completely sure, but apparently he was illiterate, Every day, he had the city of God read to him. That's how much he loved city of God. And he basically made city of God the official text of the Holy Roman Empire. Okay? Doesn't make sense. And that's the power of ideas. Charlemagne in the city of God had already created the educational framework for the Holy Roman Empire that 400 years later, Leo and Charlemagne could take in order to build the Holy Roman Empire. Throughout the city of God, they could not have imagined the Holy Roman Empire. OK? Does that make sense, guys? That's a power of ideas. You need someone to imagine the idea before you can actually implement it on Earth. All right. So let me conclude by going back to Voltaire's quotation that we looked at at the beginning of class. The Holy Roman Empire was in no way Holy Roman or an empire. And as I promised you, I will show you that this is true. OK? So let's look at this. Holy Roman Empire. The idea of holy is that the Catholic Church is really the power in charge. But that's just pageantry. That's the fiction, okay? The entire Holy Roman Empire. It's a useful fiction, okay? So the king and the pope benefit from pretending the Catholic church is in charge in order to confer legitimacy onto the king, okay? And the king and the pope benefit from displaying an alliance to the people of Europe, okay, to create a sense of unity. But this fiction depends on the pope and the emperor getting along. And at the Charlemagne, what we'll see is they don't get along because the pope insists on having power over the emperor. The emperor insists on having power over the pope. But not only that, remember, the pope and the emperor are all elected by local lords, okay? So the pope is elected by the bishops of Western Europe. The emperor is elected by the prince lectors. And these people are also extremely ambitious. They want to be the pope. They want to be the emperor. So with the idea of the Holy Roman Empire, there's still conflict going on. There's still wars and competition going on that will last for centuries and carry us into basically the 20th century, but it all goes underground. They all hide it. They pretend that Europe is at peace when really it's at war. And some of the most atrocious, gruesome stories will come from this medieval period. It's a game of throne situation. So it's not holy. The church, everyone pretends the church is in charge, but it's not really. Roman. So the authority of the Catholic Church comes from a fact that it is the direct descendant of the Roman Empire. In fact, the Catholic Church goes out of its way to appear like the Roman Empire. Latin is the language that the Catholic Church uses for bureaucracy. A lot of the practices, the cultural practices, are like the Roman. Remember that in the Roman Empire, it's the Senate that confers legitimacy onto the emperor and in this world, it's the Catholic Church that confers legitimacy onto the emperor. So the Catholic Church is trying to present itself as a continuation of the Roman Senate. But as we discuss in previous classes, what matters is the culture and as I explained to you, the culture of the Romans died with the empire. And the death of the sculpture started in year 212 when Roman citizenship was given to everyone within the empire. So the Roman empire died a long time ago. The Catholic church is not Roman. Native empire. So the Byzantines were an empire because they had an imperial bureaucracy and it's own military that can enforce its will on the provinces. The Holy Roman Empire was never truly an empire in the sense that the emperor's will was absolute. He needed the support of his allies. And there were many times throughout this history when the emperor tried to enforce his will on the Prince-Electors of Germany, and so they rebelled against him because they need to protect his autonomy. And this idea that what matters, the real powers is in these princes, in the local areas, this is what will give rise to the idea of feudalism in Europe, okay? Before the kings decide to assert their authority over everyone. All right. So the Holy Roman Empire was a use of fiction for its time in order to present the idea of legitimacy and unity across a divided Europe at war with each other. OK, so next class, we'll do the Vikings. But before we end, any questions? Yes? Yes? OK, that's a really good question. What was the relationship of the Prince electors to the emperor? Okay, so this is a really interesting question. Okay, so let's think about this if you are a prince-elector, you are a local prince in Europe. Okay, how do you benefit from the Holy Roman Empire? Well, you benefit because the Holy Roman Empire confers legitimacy to you as well. Does that make sense? Because if you're a local prince, you also have people who want your throne. You also need to keep your people united. In the Catholic Church, the religion of Catholicism was an important mechanism for you to assert authority over your people and to keep you safe from your enemies. In many ways, the Catholic Church, it's trying to be the freelance imperial bureaucracy of Europe, right? There's no emperor. The emperor has no power. So the Catholic Church is trying to be the imperial bureaucracy where it's trying to create the culture, the meta-reality of all Europeans. And it does that through its local churches, right? The priests. Because if you think about it, the people are interacting with the local priests, not with bureaucrats. So through the priests, you can collect information on the people, like how much money they're making so you can tax them better, and you can better control their thoughts, okay? So everyone's benefiting from this relationship, but it's a delicate balance because the local princes, even though they're benefiting from this relationship, they still demand autonomy, right? And the Catholic Church and the emperor, they wanna assert their central authority over the local areas. So it's a delicate balance. All right. OK? Great question, though. Does that make sense to you, Echo? All right, great. Any more questions? OK, great. So in next class, we will do the Vikings, which will be a lot of fun."}

Today we're doing the Russian Empire. And to review, we've done America and Britain so far and we discussed the civilization. Today we'll do Russia and then on Thursday we'll start Germany. Let's simplify the differences between these three great modern civilizations that are struggling for world domination even today. So as we discussed last week, the defining characteristics of the Anglo-American civilization is their belief in utilitarianism. They want to know what is practical, what works. Their idea of Christianity is the supreme God is a force that elects. What this means is that not everyone will go to heaven. Only a minority will go to heaven. And this minority are those who are proving themselves the most worthy, okay? Now, last idea of the Anglo-American civilization is that the meaning of life is the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. Essentially the pursuit of wealth, okay? So these are the characteristics of the Anglo-American civilization. On Thursday we'll start the German civilization and what you will see is that the Germans are very different. They are not utilitarian, they are very idealistic, very romantic. For them, God is a force that demands you to be your very best. Not a few people, but everyone. And the Germans believe in the unity of will. Everyone has to work together and promote German civilization. Today we do the Russians. And the Russians are a very different civilization. First of all, they're much more fatalistic than the Germans and the Americans. They don't believe that you have control over your life. They believe that you can only accept what is given to you and make the most out of it. For them, God is a force that redeems and saves all. God is merciful. God is forgiving. This is a very different conception from both the German and the Anglo-American conception. The last concept that we will look at today is for them the essence of life is to understand the mystery, miracle, and authority of the human heart. So whereas the Americans and British place their emphasis on science, on mastering the world, the material world, and whereas the Germans are actually idealistic, they want an understanding of existence, the Russians are focused very much on the human heart. For the Russians, the greatest mystery, the most knowledge is within the human heart, and this is what we will focus on today. Okay, so the leading question for today's class, the question that I'm sure you're are all interested in is why did Putin invade Ukraine? What is driving the Russian invasion of Ukraine? And there are lots of easy explanations. What I will show you today is the answer is actually extremely complicated. What Putin himself has said in multiple interviews is there are historical, sociological, philosophical issues at work here. And Westerners don't really understand what he's saying. So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to explain to you what he really means. OK, so if you look at the year 1300, you could not expect Moscow to eventually become a Russian empire. At this point in history, the Mongols have controlled most of the world. And Moscow, along with other areas in the empire, there are vassal states. They pay taxes. They pay tribute. They provide troops to the Mongol Empire. But it's the Mongol Empire that is the great power at this stage. But if you look at history, you'll see a very similar pattern where It's not really the greatest power that will eventually overwhelm everyone. It's always the marginal power. So going back to and reviewing what we've learned so far, remember when we discussed the Aztecs, the Aztecs were very much a poor, isolated, backward people, but eventually through innovation, through tenacity, for resilience, they will come to conquer most of Central America. Same thing with the Qing dynasty in China, right? At this stage in history, maybe 344 BCE, you would not expect the Qing Empire, the Qing dynasty, to overwhelm all of China and become China's first great national empire. Maybe the Chu, maybe the Wei, Qi, they're all stronger at this point in history, but it's the marginal power that seems weak at first, that will overwhelm. Same thing with Macedon, okay? At this point in history, in the year 400, 300 BCE, it's Athens, Sparta, Thebes, a lot of powers, but eventually Macedon will not only overwhelm the Great Peninsula, but they will go over to Persia and conquer the Persian Empire as well. Same thing with Rome. Rome, at this point in history, maybe 500 BCE, It is the weakest of all these Italian states. The Etruscans are the main power. And they are the poorest, the weakest, the smallest of all these great tribes. But eventually, over the next centuries, they will conquer everyone. Same thing with the Franks. After the Roman Empire, the Franks will slowly expand from central Europe and overwhelm most of Europe to create the holy Roman Empire. Okay? And the same thing with oppressions. Next class we will discuss the Prussian Empire which becomes modern day Germany. They start off as this landlocked, isolated central area within Europe, but eventually they will spread out to conquer all of Germany. Okay? So the lessons we can learn from these case studies is, there are three forces that drive these marginalized powers to become the great power of the day. So for Moscow, it's a constant process of critical destruction. First of all, open cooperative competition. So they're always surrounded by these adversaries, and because they don't really lack, and because they don't have natural defenses, they don't have mountains, rivers, it forces them to be tough and unified in order to defeat their enemies. And it's toughness and unity that will allow Moscow to emerge as a great power in Central Asia. Advantaged by disadvantages, okay? You're better off being weak because if you're weak, it forces you to be innovative and open. Okay? So they say necessity is the mother of invention. The last factor is vastness. Okay? So the idea that historical humiliation and subjection forced reflection and resilience. Because Moscow for the longest time was subjected to vassals by the mongols. It forced them to be humble. And humility allows you to reflect deeply on your own weaknesses, to be honest with yourself, and eventually triumph over all your adversaries. So these are the three factors that will drive the massive expansion of Moscow. Moscow starts off as this very small principality within the Mongol Empire, and then it will eventually become the successor to the Mongol Empire. All right. So let's look at the origins of Russia. So the history is we have to go back to the Viking Age. This is about the year 900, 1,000. So the Vikings are in Sweden and Denmark and Norway. And because it's so poor and because it's becoming overly populated, they will start to expand over to England, to Greenland, to other areas. And then, sorry, can you open the door? And then they will also move east, okay? Why are they moving east? Because all the great wealth of the age is located in the Byzantine Empire in Egypt and as well as the Abbasid Empire in Iraq and Persia. So they're here to establish trading posts. And when they establish trading posts, what will happen is that first of all, they will intermarry with the local Slavic population as well as the steps people. They will also build an alliance with the Byzantine Empire and become basically vassals to the Byzantines. What will happen is over time, their training post will become cities and they will expand outwards. So the tradition, the custom at this stage in history is if you're noble, you must go and conquer new lands. When you conquer new lands, you can instate the people to work for you. This is a very feudal system. So this forces a process of causing expansion. If they don't expand, they're going to fight amongst themselves. So the Kyrian Rus' expands very quickly throughout this area. Eventually, they'll all be conquered by the Mongols. And when the Mongols leave, it leaves a vacuum of great powers. So the great power of this age is the grand ducky of Luthiania. Novograd is also a great power. Moscow is the weakest, but again, as I said, over time, because it is weak, it's forced to be united, it's forced to be resilient, it's forced to be innovative. And over time, what it will do is it will overwhelm Novograd and become the Russian Empire. And as you can see, what will happen is the Russian Empire will expand really quickly until it absorbs the entire Mongol Empire as well as unify all of Northern Asia. It is now the largest land mass in the world. So the thing to understand about the Russians is that even though it's a very large country, most of it is not able to be cultivated. Okay, so it has very low population. Most of the wealth is located in over here. Okay, this is basically Ukraine. This is what's driving the invasion because historically most of the wealth in Russia has been located in the Ukraine area. And if you go over here, it's basically just forests and mountains. So why are they moving eastwards when there's very little resources here? The answer is fur. Fur is very valuable commodity. They go and they trade fur for a living. Okay, some of the great stars of Russian history is Ivan the Great. His son is Ivan the Terrible, who will expand Russia greatly. The thing to understand about Russian expansion is it's really not driven by state policy. it's really driven by oppression and misery. What this means is that because Russia is essentially a feudal state, the only way to build a better life is if you escape eastwards and you basically ethically clean that area and build a new settlement. So that's what's driving this. And what happened is as these people move further eastwards, the state will follow them in order to collect taxes. And sometimes the state will intervene in order to protect these people from their adversaries in the local areas. But it's a very brutal process that takes centuries. And the Russians went out because there's more of them and also because they have muskets and the local people do not have muskets. Okay, so as you can see, the expansion is very rapid. Only about 300 years. And as I mentioned, it is an extremely brutal process. Okay, so these are paintings of the brutality involved in this Eastwood expansion. It involves ethnic cleansing, it involves enslaving people, okay? Yeah, it's a brutal process. And these paintings are meant to capture the brutality of the process. And you can see the misery involved. Okay, so these people who are being conquered, they're either being ethnic clans or they're being forced to immigrate or they're being enslaved. It's a very similar process with the Americans. And these will eventually become the two great empires of the 20th century, as well as really the 21st century. So the Americans have the same situation where they're expending westwards, and the Russians are expending eastwards. The difference is this. The Americans are expending westwards for better opportunities, to get wealthy, to build a better life. The Russians are expanding eastwards because they are trying to escape misery and oppression and slavery. That's the difference. And because of this difference, even though there are many similarities, the fundamental belief systems of these two nations are very different. Americans are fundamentally optimistic. Russians are fundamentally fatalistic, pessimistic. All right. So let's summarize the differences between the Slavic East, the Russian East, and the Germanic West. Okay? Slavic gives us the word slave. Why? Because for the longest time, the Slavs in Europe, in Eastern Europe, they were pagans. They weren't Muslims. They weren't Christians. And the custom at that time is you can only enslave people who are not of your religious belief. Okay? So the Paganism was one of the most valuable people because they can be enslaved by everyone. So Vikings came, the Muslims came, the Christians came to enslave the Slavic people and sell them off to the Byzantines, the Abbasids. And that's why we get the word slave, okay? So let's look at the three major differences between Russia and Germany. The first major difference is that the Russians believe they are here to the Biden Empire, which is a very top-down centralized bureaucracy. And this is something we discussed before. The Germans believe they are here to the Holy Roman Empire, which is a confederation. As we discussed when we discussed the Holy Roman Empire, it was impossible for anyone to conquer all of Europe. And so the Holy Roman Empire was based on consensus. It was based on diplomacy. It was based on intermarriage. So this is a much more democratic, much more independent system than the Byzantines. Second major difference is the Germans have a Catholic church. The Russians have something called the Eastern Orthodox church. This sounds similar, but what I will show you as we move on is it's actually not in day. These two belief systems are extremely different. Third major difference is Germanic West, the Germans, they are culturally coherent. They believe they speak the same language. they believe that they come from the same culture, whereas the Russian Empire is culturally incoherent. It encompasses a vast array of different cultures, languages, and belief systems. OK, so the Russian Empire starts with Peter the Great. And what Peter the Great does is he modernizes Russia and forces a decisive war with Sweden, which is at Europe right now, the great military power. Okay, so for most of Russian history, the European powers didn't really take Russia seriously. And they just thought that the Russians are part of Asia, they're really not part of Europe. And it was a great, was determined to Russianize, Europeanize Russia and prove Russia a European power. Okay, and he does that for three reasons, all right? Let's, oh sorry, sorry, for many reasons, okay? He does it because Russia right now is an empire, and as an empire you need a unifying ideology of philosophy. And for the Russians for the longest time, even Putin shares his philosophy is, they believe they are trying to restore the Bosnian empire and be the third Rome and save civilization, okay? So what do I mean by this? All right, so the first Rome, of course, was Rome. Second Rome was Constantinople. The third Rome now is Moscow. And not only that, but they believe they are the true here to the Christian tradition. All these other Christian religions out there, Catholic, Protestant, they are corrupt forms. It's the Orthodox Church that is the true here to the Roman Christianity. Christ for military supremacy means that right now at this stage in history, all the great militaries are in Europe. Okay, so Russia basically needs to copy, imitate the Europeans. So what Russia does is it imports a lot of actually German soldiers and mercenaries to learn German military technique. Question of absolute power means that all these stars, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, they're interested in centralizing authority. They want to remove this feudal system and centralize power in all in their hands. Okay, delusion of authority of church and nobility. So in Europe, the Catholic Church is above the kings. So Peter the Great wants to subject the church to his authority as well as the nobility. Right now, the great threat, the great rival to the Russians is the Ottoman Empire. And last is the contempt of Asia. So even though the Mongols probably influence the Russians much more than the Vikings. The Russians believed the Vikings are their true ancestors, not the Mongols. They tried to erase the Mongols from their own history. They kind of shamed of it. Okay, so again, as I mentioned, at this time in Europe, about the year 1700, Sweden is the great military power of the age. And Peter Great and Charles the 12th of Sweden, they get into this major conflict. And Peter Great is not that great, okay? He has a lot of issues. But Charles II is a complete disaster. And the reason why is he's a young man, he's only about 27 when he invades Russia, who fends himself as Anthony Great. Okay, and as we discussed, Anthony Great was very problematic because he was very tyrannical and also because he believed he was invincible. So Charles the Great decides to go invade Russia. And this is a disaster. Why? Because Peter the Great will use something called a scorched earth policy. Basically, he knows that he cannot on the battlefield defeat the Swedes. So what the Russians do is they retreat and burn down all the fields so the army cannot feed itself. Okay, this is called scorched earth. And this is important because this is how the Russians will defeat Napoleon in 1812. And this is important because That's just how the Russians will defeat the Germans in World War II, okay? So this is a very feminine pattern in history. As I mentioned, the great enemy of Russia at this time are the Ottomans, okay? And so the Russians and the Ottomans will clash over the Crimea, okay? The Crimea. And this will lead to something called the Korean War in 1854. Okay, so Peter the Great, again, he wins because Charles II makes disastrous military decisions during this war. But this begins the Russian Empire. For the first time, Russia is now considered a great European power because it's defeated the great military power of Europe, Sweden. Okay, so these are paintings celebrating the great Russian victory over the Swedes. So after this victory, Russia will expand very greatly. And then after the Peter Great, the next great westernizer of the Russian Empire is Catherine the Great. What's important, first to remember about Catherine the Great is she's actually not Russian. She's actually German. She was born in Prussia and she married into the Russian noble family. It was very common at this stage for the European powers to intermarry with each other. And most of the Russian nobility, a lot of them actually have German blood and they actually spoke French at home. So this Russianization created a process where the nobility now is very European. They speak French. They have German ancestry. and the peasants are Slavic, okay? And so this creates a massive divide in Russia. Capital of the Great will extend Russia greatly, as you can see from this map. The great event that basically thrust Russia as a great power is the feat of Napoleon in 1812. Napoleon, as we know, the great conqueror, he invaded Russia in 1812, and he defeats the Russian army, but what the Russians do that no one can possibly imagine they would do is, they burned down the capital, Moscow, okay? Moscow is their cultural capital, it is the heart and soul of the Russian Empire, and they burned it down to starve Napoleon's army. And the Europeans thought this was incredible act of barbarism. But for the Russians, they believed it was an incredible act of self-sacrifice that saved the Russian Empire. In fact, the great Russian composer, he wrote a symphony dedicated to celebrating the victory over Napoleon called 1812 Overture. Have you guys heard the Overture? All right, let me play for you, okay? By making the sacrifice, they not only saved Russia, but they saved all of Europe. They saved Russian civilization basically. I'm sure you guys have heard of it, right? But this is to celebrate the freedom of Napoleon by Tchaikovsky. Okay, after the defeat of Napoleon though, Europeans take notice of Russia, especially Britain. Remember, Britain is this great naval power that is dedicated to a development conquer policy of Europe. They basically gang up against whoever is the growing power in Europe. So as Russia is growing, the British encouraged the Ottomans and the French to unite against Russia to prevent Russian expansion into the Ottoman Empire. Eventually the Russians will defeat the Ottoman Empire, but the Korean War is a major setback for the Russians. And this creates something called the Great Game, where the Russians are now being helmed in by the British, okay? So the British and the Russians will now fight for supremacy over Central Asia. A disaster, the next disaster for the Russians is the Russian-Japanese War, where Russia gets heavily defeated by the Japanese and this sort of instigates revolutionary sentiment and fever in Russia. And of course, what follows next is the great disaster, the first war where the Russians are defeated mightily by the Germans, and this creates something called the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which destroys the Russian Empire and creates the Soviet Empire. So this is just a brief history. We'll go into the revolution at a future date. It's a very important event, and I want to dedicate a whole class to it. but that's a brief background of the Russian Empire. Okay, so now let's talk about the civilization. And as I discussed, Russianization has been a major trend in Europe, but because of Russianization, there are three major contradictions that are created within the Russian Empire. Okay, and these three contradictions will go on to create Russian civilization. Okay, these contradictions are, It's both European and Central Asian. It's both Viking and Mongol. It's both Slavic as well as Tartar. So there's a lot of ethnicities, a lot of cultures within Russia, and it's a contradiction. Second great contradiction is it fends itself as a Christian Orthodox nation. In fact, the true Christian nation, that's also very pagan. Remember, there's this massive Eastwood expansion In the process, there's a lot of war, there's a lot of violence, okay? It's very pagan. And the peasantry, even to this day, maintained a lot of pagan rituals, a lot of pagan beliefs. And the third great contradiction is between enlightenment and empire. So Katharine Great, who was Prussian, she tried to saw herself as an enlightened monarch. She was best friends with Voltaire. They never met but they were pen pals. And she saw herself as an enlightened despot who was trying to bring reason and justice and goodness to Russia. But at the same time it's an empire. And it's a brutal empire that, and the Russians engage in a lot of barbarism. So this is also a massive contradiction. And so if you study Russian civilization, it is unique because of these three major contradictions. So let me show you how they influence Russian art and literature. Okay, let's look at some of the major Russian cultural figures. And there are too many in the name, okay? There's just a lot of them, but I'll just go through the most famous. This is actually Pushkin, who is considered a Shakespeare of Russia. He's the great innovator of Russian language. He basically modernizes the language. And he's a poet and a very romantic figure in Russia. He's basically a national poet of Russia. Something really interesting about him is his grandfather was an African general, who became a noble in Russia. So he's about 1 1⁄8 black. And he's very proud of it. And so what's important to first remember is, again, for most of human history, race was not a concept. People didn't really care what race you were. This is Anton Chovkov, who is considered the greatest short story writer in human history. Music, Russian music is extremely, Russian music is beautiful. I'll play you some clips of Russian music. This is Glanka, who's a very famous composer. The most famous composer of course is Peter Tchaikovsky. And he is famous for three ballet that are still performed today. The Nutcracker, which is performed Christmas. This is his most famous swan lake, okay? So let's hear some music from swan lake just so you can appreciate the beauty and the depth of Russian music. What's astonishing about this music is that This music can flow into your essence, your soul. This music comes from the soul. And to create music this beautiful, your soul must suffer. Your soul must engage in misery, pain and suffering in order to create such beauty. So this is just haunting, beautiful music that Tchaikovsky created. Sipping Beauty is also a really famous play by Tchaikovsky. Igor Szyrinski is considered the first great modern composer, and he composed something called The Writes of Spring. This is 1913. It was first performed in Paris, and it's so revolutionary that it costs a riot within the music hall. This ballet, what it tries to do is it tries to fuse the pagan tradition into modernity. Okay? I'm gonna play some excerpts from The Rights of Spring and you can see how revolutionary this music is. And what I want you to notice is This music expresses, encapsulates the contradictions within Russian civilization between the pagan and the Christian. You can feel the rawness, the energy, the violence, the aggression, the sensuality. So this musical, this ballet, it's about the Rites of Spring. So it goes back to a Slavic tradition where they celebrate the mother goddess. And it's spring, so to celebrate this transition, perform games and have festivals. And what ends, what ends the festivities is the sacrifice of a maiden. She will dance until she dies. And when she dances to her death, her heart will explode. And this symbolizes how the mother god is, gives life to the world by making, by dancing, and basically pouring out her blood into the world in order for plants for the seasons to change. And then her heart will explode. And in this world, what's important for us to understand is, it's all interconnected, and it must be balanced out and harmonized. So if the mother goddess sacrifices herself in order for there to be life, then the maiden must sacrifice herself to thank the mother goddess, okay? All right, so now let's move on to Russian literature. In Russian civilization, there are two great prophets. They are Leo Toystoy and Theodor Dostoyevsky. Together they will create modern Russian civilization, the sensibilities, the beliefs, the philosophies of modern Russian civilization. And what they're trying to do is, they're trying to reconcile the contradictions within Russia through their novels. These are the great novelists in the human tradition. All right, so Toys Royce's most famous novel is Anna Karinina, which is considered also the greatest work of literature, the greatest novel ever written. And I want to first read some passages from Anna Karina. This is the beginning, okay? This is one of the most famous beginnings in world literature. Happy families are all alike. Everyone happy family is unhappy in its own way. Everything was confusion in the Omblosky's house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl. So what Toy Story is telling us from the first couple paragraphs is, what's your organization? Your organization? It is a process of corrupting the Russian soul. The idea that you bring in a French girl, and the husband's going to sleep with her. It's corruption. Now, this is important because the Oblossky, the husband, they are now engaged in a divorce. And Anna-Karina and Nina will come from St. Petersburg to try to reconcile husband and wife. And Anna-Karina and Nina herself will commit adultery. She'll fall in love with a man named Ronsky. They'll have a very passionate affair. And this passionate affair will destroy both Ronsky and Anna-Karina and Nina. Anna-Karina has a husband and a child back at St. Petersburg. She asks for divorce, does not give it to her. And then she slowly falls into depression. And then she commits to killing herself. So let's look at the monologue that she has within herself before she decides to kill herself. So she's trying to explain why she's unhappy. My love keeps going more passionate and egoistic, selfish. While his is winning and winning and that's why we're drifting apart. So they've been together for a long time, but she feels that Ronsey is no longer as passionate as he used to be while she is becoming more passionate. And there's no help for it. He has everything for me, and I want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely. He wants more and more to get away from me. We walk to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly driven in different directions. And there's no altering that. He tells me I'm insanely jealous and I've told myself that I am insanely jealous, but it's not true. I'm not jealous, but I'm jealous, and I, sorry, I'm not jealous, but I'm unsatisfied. This is the most important word, unsatisfied. It tells us that she's a very selfish person who's using love as a way to fill the void in her heart. She feels that this relationship, this adultery, will give her meaning in her life. And what she doesn't understand is, when that happens, when you try to possess someone, you can't love that person because love is really about giving yourself all to another person, okay? So think about Dante. Dante never got anything from Beatrice, but he loved her regardless, okay? So this is where Anna Karina fails. She doesn't really understand what love is, and she's very selfish. Also a huge problem for Anna Karina Nina is Because she betrayed her husband, she now fears that Bronsky will not betray her. So do you see the psychology here? And that's why she can't love. Because she broke the fundamental condition for love, which is trust. So this is telling us that the heart is a mystery. It's something that you cannot reason out. It's something that you can never fully understand. In theory, if you find someone more attractive, if you think you're better off with him, then you should go be with him, okay? That's Western civilization, basically. Pursue your own happiness. But what Toi Shui is telling us is, the heart is something you cannot master, okay? Maybe your mind can master. The reason, the logic, you can master. But the human heart works by its own set of logic. And you must respect the human heart. If you want to love, then you must give and not receive. If you want to love, base your love on trust. Do not betray yourself, do not betray others. Does that make sense? All right, so now let's move on to really the man who is at the heart and center of Russian civilization. His name is Theodor Dostoevsky. So let me give you some background about Theodor Dostoevsky. Both Toy Story and Dov Skjelski were extremely passionate Christians. They really believed in Christianity and they had deep empathy for the people around them. Toy Story was born very wealthy, he was of nobility and he inherited a lot of money. But because he was so distraught by the suffering around him because his wealth was basically based on the oppression of the peasantry, right? He actually wanted to give up all his money. He wanted to throw it all away and become a beggar. He wanted to become poor. And it was only at the insistence of his family that prevented him from doing what he felt his heart demanded of him. Theodosius comes from the lower nobility. His father was a doctor. And as a young man, he was a revolutionary. And he participated in these literary, revolutionary circles. He wasn't violent, but he had these subversive ideas. So he was arrested and he was condemned to death. He was put in front of a firing squad, along with others who were part of the subversion. And at the last minute, his sentence was commuted. He was speared by the Tsar. He was sent to hard labor in Siberia for a number of years. And this was a very traumatic, but it was also an extremely enlightening experience for Dostoevsky. It made him think very deeply about the meaning of life. Okay, so he writes something called Crime and Punishment, which is really the great novel of Russian civilization. It has to do with a man, Raskolnikov, who he's young, he's brilliant, he's a university student, but he's poor. And he decides that in order to escape his circumstance, in order to control his fate, he's gonna murder a woman, a part broker, who has a lot of money. No one likes her, no one will miss her. And then he will take her money and then build a new life for himself. And this will become the basis for his greatness. And he reasons out that, you know what? As a great individual, as a genius, I'm gonna contribute so much to humanity. So if I kill an old woman no one likes, it won't really matter. So he's been thinking about this for a long time and he's got it all reasoned out. And what crime and punishment will show us is reason is nothing. It doesn't really matter. What matters is the heart. All right, so first I wanna talk about Toskiev's understanding of God, which is the Russian understanding of God. So at a bar at the beginning of the novel, Raskolovtokov meets a middle-aged man who's a drunk. He's alcoholic named Marmaladov. Mimolodov. And Mimolodov is an extremely pitiful man because what he's done is he's he's he's like a middle-aged bureaucrat and he's been poor and he marries a poor widow as well and they have like four children to feed. So the widow decides to prostitute Mimolodov's daughter, Sonya, to make money. Okay and then Mimolodov in a fit of tremendous regret, he goes and finds a job. And this seems like it's gonna resolve all problems with the family, right? But he does something that no one really can predict or expect. He decides to steal all the money within the household, quit his job, and get drunk every day. And you hear this, and you're like, that makes no sense. But again, that's the beauty of Russian literature. It's focused on what drives us psychologically. It's not about what's reasonable, what is logical, it's really about what we do in these circumstances. And so, Mar-Milodov, he's driven to despair because he feels he sacrificed his daughter. He hates the fact that his daughter has become a prostitute and he cannot allow himself and his family to live happily ever after now that his daughter of prostitution and that's why he decides to become alcoholic. And then they talk about God, okay? They talk about God and what the nature of God is. And this is very important for us to understand Orphanax Christianity. He says to Raskar Natav, why am I to be pity, you say? Yes, there's nothing to pity me for. I have to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pity feet, not pity. Crucify me, oh judge, be crucified me, but pity me. And I will go all myself to be crucified, for it is not merrymaking I seek but tears and tribulation. Do you suppose you that sell that this pen of yours has been sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and I found it and I have tasted it. But he will pity us, who has had pity on all men, who has understood all men and all things. He is the one, he too is the judge. He will come in that day and he will ask, where is the daughter who gave herself for for her cross, consent of stepmother, and for the little children of another. Where's the daughter who had pity upon the filthy, drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed, by his beaconliness? And he will say, come to me, I have already forgiven thee once, I've forgiven thee once, thy sins which are many are forgiven thee, for thou hast loved much. You'll forgive my Sonia, you'll forgive, I know it. I felt in my heart when I was with her just now, you will judge and he will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek. So this God that the Orthodox Christians celebrate, it's a forgiving God. It's a merciful God. It is a knowledgeable God, a wise God. Why? Because we humans cannot be trusted to be wise. We humans are, we suffer the mysteries of the heart. We do not know ourselves. We do not know our nature. And therefore, we are bound to suffer. And God understands this. And that's why God will ultimately redeem us all when the time is appropriate. So it's fatalistic, but at the same time, it's also optimistic. OK, so let us summarize what the differences are between the Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox religions. And again, these are different branches of Christianity, and they seem similar, but in reality, they are extremely different. the Protestants believe that we choose to sin. We have free will. The Catholics don't believe in free will. They say we are born in sin and the Orthodox are fatalistic. They believe we are born to sin. We cannot control our own nature. That's the first major difference. Second major difference is only a few will be saved and redeemed. The Protestant is a very unforgiving religion. Only if you work hard and become very wealthy will you be saved. The Catholics believe that no, everyone can be saved and redeemed. And the Orthodox believe we are beyond salvation and redemption. The human heart is so dark, so mysterious, that we are beyond salvation and redemption. And that is why God is great, because only God can save and redeem us, even though we are beyond salvation and redemption. The third major difference is the Prophets believe that our our faith in God will save and redeem us. The Catholics believe obedience to God, oh sorry, obedience to the church is what will save and redeem us, whereas the Orthodox believe that only God can forgive us. And if God forgives us, we can't really control. So these are the three major differences. And this is important because the Orthodox religion is at the heart and center of Russian civilization. Okay, so let's see how this influences crime and punishment. So this is a very important passage in crime and punishment. And we'll be discussing this a lot as we move on, okay? So here, Raskolnikov, he's killed the old lady, he's stolen her money, but now he feels tremendous regret. And he doesn't know why. He can't sleep. He falls into sickness. He doesn't know why this is happening, because he's already reasoned it out. And then he meets Sonia, who again is Marmela Adolf's daughter. And he confesses to her what he's done. And not only that, but he tries to explain why he's done this. This is a very important passage in Western civilization. I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for everyone to get wise, it will take too long. So he's basically given up on humanity. Afterwards, I understood that that would never come to pass, that man won't change and that nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it. Yes, that's so. That's the law of their nature, Sonia. That's so. And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and has power over them and then who is greatly daring is right in their eyes. He who despises most things will be a law giver among them And he who dares most of all will be most in the right. So it has been till now. And so it'll always be, a man must be blind not to see it. So let's go back to the French Revolution. Ropes peer is someone who fundamentally believes that everyone can be reasoned with. That reason exists in all of us. If we appeal to reason, then people will be good. Napoleon is someone who believes that, I must lead the man. People are weak, I must be strong. Okay, so what Storofkov is saying is like, I kill the old lady because I'm trying to prove that I'm Napoleon and not Robespierre. It's people like Napoleon who will change history, who will save us. Robespierre can only be sacrificed. This is important because what Darcy Gensley wants to show in Crime and Punishment is that this sort of reasoning, it sounds right, but it goes against the human heart. That happens when the reason and the heart come into conflict, the heart will always triumph. And this can only lead Raskolnikov into misery. Also, what will happen is that very important thinkers like Fredrik Nietzsche, as well as Simon Freud, they will read this and interpret it in their own way. So Fredrik Nietzsche will read this and think that, no, this makes sense. It's not that Raskolnikov is wrong, it's that he didn't believe this enough. All right, so we'll talk about this next class. All right, so Raskolnikov, he's being pursued by the police. And it's obvious that he's the culprit. It's obvious that he's guilty. But what happens is someone else confesses to the crime. And we don't know why, but someone else confesses to the crime. And at this point, you would think that Raskolnikov is now happy, he's now free to do whatever he wants. This shows that it is God's will that he become great. It is God's will that he kill and become great. But what happens next is he decides to confess the crime. And the confession is, the confession strikes, it's so striking and so nonsensical that the legal system doesn't know what to do with him. So they basically sentenced him to like hard labor in Siberia for a few years. It's the latest crime. So it's the latest punishment he could have ever received. And at this point, you would think that, OK, now he's happy with himself because he killed someone, he failed regret, and now he's doing some punishment. And then eventually he will be redeemed. But this causes even more anxiety in him. It causes more confusion in him. He did not repent of his crime. He doesn't feel guilty or remorseful for killing the landlady. At least he might have found relief in raging and its stupidity as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that have brought him to prison. But now in prison, in freedom, he fought over and criticized all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as he had seen at the fatal time. In what way, he asked himself, was my theory superior than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has only to look at the things quite independently, broadly and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas. My idea will be no means seen so strange. Oh, skeptics and half-punny philosophers, why do you halt halfway? He doesn't really understand what's happening. He doesn't understand what his problem is. There was nothing wrong with his plan. There was nothing wrong with what he did. And now he's being punished for what he did. And he cannot escape his own reason. All right? Now, we have to go all the way back to the beginning of this course when we discuss Homer and the Iliad. Remember, Achilles had the same problem. Achilles saw the death of his friend, Patroclus, and he swore vengeance against Hector. And then he killed Hector, and then he started to mutilate Hector's body. And after he did so, he would think he would found relief and cartharsis. but it only made him even more depressed, more miserable. Okay? So this is what Homer and Dostoevsky is telling us. Don't try to reason things out. If you try to reason things out, it will only make you miserable because the truth is not within reason. Okay? The truth is within the human heart. Why does my action strike them as so horrible? He said to himself, is it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at rest. Of course it was a legal crime, of course. The letter of the law was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the law, and that's enough. Of course, in that case, many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting, ought to have been punished at their first steps. But those men succeeded. And so they were right, and I didn't. And so I had no right to have taken that step. It was only in that he recognized his criminality, owning the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it, okay? So he keeps on reasoning and he decides that the source of his misery is his weakness, okay? He killed the lady and he felt regret for doing it. So this proves he's not great. Napoleon wouldn't have felt any regret. Julius Caesar would have laughed about it. Alexander the Great would have bragged about it. But he felt regret and therefore he is weak, okay? And that is where his reasoning gets him, and it will make him more miserable. Okay, but he finds salvation in redemption. And he finds salvation in redemption in the love of Sonia. So right now, Raskara is in Siberia in prison, and Sonia comes all the way to be with him. Okay? And this is how the novel ends. How it happened, he did not know. But all at once, something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms around her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. The same moment she understood and the light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come. So this is what saves him. He surrenders himself to his love for Sonia. He surrenders himself to Sonia. And that's what ultimately saves him. So think back to the Iliad, right? What saves Achilles? What saves Achilles is, Prayam comes, kisses his hand, forgives him, and then Achilles surrenders himself to Prayam. They cry together. So the source of salvation and redemption is in our hearts, not in reason. You have to surrender yourself to your love. for the other people like Sonia or to God. That's where salvation is. Okay? Alright. So the other great novel of Daschiafzi is called the Brothers Kramazov. Okay? And it's much too long to read but there's a very important passage within a novel. It's about a thousand pages called the Grand Inquisitor. The Grand Inquisitor, he is in charge of the Inquisition in Spain and as you know the Inquisition in Spain in 1492, it is horrific. Christians who have their own ideas are being persecuted, they're being slaughtered, okay? And it is a nightmare. So what happens is Jesus in heaven, he sees this pain, he sees his suffering, and it bothers him. So he descends to the earth. And when he's walking among men, and right away, people recognize who he is. They worship him. Then he's dragged before the Grand Inquisitor. he becomes a prisoner to the Grand Inquisitor. At this point you would think the Grand Inquisitor would be happy to see his God. Instead, he gets really, really angry at Jesus. Thou did not love them at all. Thou who did come to give thy life for them, instead of taking possession of man's freedom, you did increase it and burden the spiritual kingdom of mankind with suffering forever. You did desire man's free love that he should follow you freely enticed and taken captive by you. In place of the rich and ancient law, men must hereafter with free heart, decide for himself what is good and what is evil, having only your image before him as his guide. But did you not know that he would at last reject even your image and your truth if he is weighed down with a fearful burden of free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in you, for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than you have caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems. Okay? Okay, so the idea here is this. So one question that Jesus would have for the great inquisitor is, I sacrifice myself to free my people, to give people the free choice, free will, to love me freely. Instead, you guys have built this great Christian empire, Catholic Church to oppress everyone. Why did you do that? And the great inquisitor is saying to him, it's because people don't want free choice. People don't want free will. They only told what to do. And you refuse to be their king. You refuse to be their emperor. You demand of them that they reason that they love you freely. And people don't want don't want to do that. So we had no choice but to oppress people, to build a church as a great oppressive empire in order to liberate people from the burden of free choice. Okay, does that make sense? That's the argument here. You did come to give, sorry, and how are the other weak ones to blame because they could not endure what the strong have endured? How is the weak sort of blame that it is unable to receive such terrible gifts? Can you have simply come to the elect and for the elect? He's also saying to Jesus, listen, you tell us that only by believing in you freely can we be redeemed. But that takes power, that takes strength. What about those who cannot do such a thing? How about the weak? How about the lost? Will you condemn them to hell? That's not very merciful. Okay. Okay, so this is how the story ends. When the inquisitor sees speaking, he waited some time for his prisoner, Jesus, to answer him. His silence weighed down upon him. He saw the prisoner have listened intently all the time, looking gently in his face and heavily not wishing to reply. The old man longed for him to say something, however bitter and terrible, but he suddenly approached the old man in silent and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips. That was all his answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to him, go and come no more. Come not at all. Never, never. And he let him out into the dark alleys of a town. The prisoner went away. And the old man, the kiss glows in his heart. The old man adheres to his idea. All right. So what this is saying is this. The Gwen Inquisitor, he has this novel. He has this philosophy of why Jesus is back, of why we should worship Satan, of why we need an empire, why we need oppression. And it all makes sense, okay? And now Jesus must respond. And Jesus responds with an act of forgiveness, with an act of charity. He kisses the grand inquisitor. And this is exactly like Priam kissing Achilles, right? Priam didn't go to reason with Achilles, Prime went to kiss Achilles' hand to forgive him. Okay? Now what's important for us to understand is the kiss glows in his heart the old man adheres to his idea. We can't change someone's reason ever, but we can change his heart with an act of mercy and forgiveness and love. That's the secret of humanity. The baguette you know where? Because people are stubborn about their ideas. But the heart, even though it's a mystery, it's still loving. It's still open. So if you touch it, you change people forever. OK? All right. So let's go back to the original question. Why did Putin invade Ukraine? What Putin has said over and over again is we invaded Ukraine to save Russian civilization. And that's the answer. Because for the Russians, their civilization is unique, it is distinct, and it's And it's beautiful. It's worth dying for. OK? So even though the Russian empire is gone, Putin and Russians believe they are the heirs to the empire. So let's look at the difference between the American civilization and the Russian civilization to understand why this war happened. OK, sorry. To be very clear, this is how the Russians see the Americans. OK? Does that make sense? This is how the Russians see the Americans. First of all, they see the Americans extremely materialistic. The only thing that matters is things, buying things, consuming things, obtaining things. But knowing that, but the Americans believe that this is the only good in the world. It's universal. Everyone wants to buy things. So we just let everyone buy things. And the Americans are expansionist, which means that not only is it right and good for people to buy things, But everyone should have the right to buy things. So if you are preventing people from buying things, you are a dictator, you are a tyrant. Okay, it is our responsibility to liberate the world so we can all become consumers. North Korea, Iran, they ought to be liberated so that their people can buy things from us. Okay, so that's the American civilization. The Russians think like, no, we are a spiritual people, We are unique and we demand sovereignty. We demand the right to live the lives we choose to live. We demand the right to be who we are. Okay? And if it means fighting America, if it means our deaths, if it means sacrifice, we will do so because our civilization is the greatest in the world. Because our conception of God is the correct conception because our truth is the real truth. All right? But in other words, this is really a class of civilizations. And in the class of civilizations, there can only be one winner. There can be no compromise. Okay? So there's war in Ukraine. It is seemingly something much more devastating, much more calicismic. All right? And so this is what's going on. All right. That's it, guys. Any questions? You guys, is this clear to you? All right. about what we discussed. Yeah, great. So, you're right. So Russian literature is very romantic. And the idea of romanticism is a response to enlightenment. Because in enlightenment with Kant and Rousseau, the argument is that reason is ultimate salvation. For reason, you can save yourself and you can save civilization. If it's logical, then it's truthful. And the ideal is, sorry, the romantics are saying, no that's not true. Okay, and what Dostoev is saying, is telling us that, is that this is nonsense. Reason doesn't really get you anywhere. For reason, you can reason that it's okay to kill millions of people. Logic doesn't really get you anywhere. What you have to do is listen to your heart. Think about the heart. That's where the truth lies. So it's very much a reaction against enlightenment in Europe at this time. Okay, Dostoevsky is also saying, like Toystoy, organization of Russia is only corrupting us. What we need to do is return to our true selves, which is an orthodox civilization. But that's the true Christianity. So great, any more questions? Okay, that's a great question. Okay, so the question, and it's a wonderful question. If I just said that Russians are fatalistic, then how are they so resilient? You can't logically figure it out. It's like, it's kind of logically explained to you the feeling, but it's like knowing that the world is doomed. We're heading towards doom. And what we do isn't that important. It compels you to live your best life. So that's what meaning is. Meaning is, with the knowledge that the world is ultimately headed towards doom, you, as a person, are compelled to live your best life, nonetheless. And that's a very pagan, very Viking mentality. So before Christianity, this was true for people. It's okay the world is gonna end. What matters is the life you lead today. It's problematic because Americanization, Americanization has such a huge impact on global culture. And we think in very utilitarian terms. We should do something because it gets us somewhere. And Russian civilization, it's very much like, we should do something because we know it doesn't get us anywhere. And that's what truth is. That's what life is about. That's the meaning of life. That's the purpose of life. Even though you know it won't get you anywhere, you should still do it, because that's where the meaning is. Okay? If you think about it, if you go deeper, then it's also like a profound faith in God. Okay? Like you know the world is ending, but you still work hard to make it better. And that's what faith in God really is. Doesn't make sense. If you know like if you do something and God rewards you, that's not faith really. That doesn't make sense. Okay so so I understand it's really hard for us to understand, but what I'm trying to show you in this class is it's hard for us to understand because we think in a certain way. And if you think in a certain way, you have to use logic and reason and language. And what the FCFC and Toy Story is telling us is that that's very limiting, okay? Sometimes you have to listen to your heart. And your heart knows, I know the world is doomed because that's just reality. But nevertheless, I have responsibility to my children. I have responsibility to my neighbors, to the people I love to try my best regardless. And that's what faith in God, that's what faith in each other, that's what true love really is. Does that make sense? Okay, all right, great, great question though. And I'll be honest with you, I'm confused by this as well, okay, because I'm so Western in my thinking. But I think, again, you have to train yourself not to be so logical at times, all right? Okay, any more questions? Does that make sense to you? Okay. Oh, great question. Why are the Russians so pessimistic? Okay, first of all, it's really cold in Russia. Okay, if it's cold, you're not that optimistic. Second of all, Russian civilization is built on violence. The Americans basically went over and were able to steal the continent from the natives. The natives didn't really put that much of an existence. But Russia was built on tremendous violence. Not only did Russians have to get rid of the Mongols, they'd have to fight the Swedes, the Germans, the French. They fought everyone basically. It was like a never-ending process of war. And then the conflicts within the people. So Russia's a very violent society. And so that leads to a natural pessimism. So I know what I'm saying this is, even though Russia is huge, it's not that many resources and people have to constantly fight over these resources. Whereas America, it's huge, lots of resources, and people, if you work hard, you can obtain a lot of resources, okay? So that leads to an optimistic attitude. So the question really isn't why Russians are fatalistic, because most people are fatalistic. The question really is why are Americans so optimistic? All right, okay, does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? Was this clear to you guys? Okay, and I know it's hard, okay? But I will say like, Russian civilization, even though I personally would never wanna live in Russia, okay, because there's a lot of racism in Russia. But it is a unique, beautiful civilization. And I hope that in the future you have a chance to read Toys Toys Dostoyevsky because they are really the best novelists ever. So next class, we will start the Germans civilization."}

So here we are. In my last video I discussed how Isaac Newton built the International Foundations for Christian Zionism which is driving American Middle East policy today. And today I want to explain to you why Christian Zionism is just a powerful force in the world. As you know Nanyahu is visiting Washington this week, meeting with senior lawmakers, including with President Donald Trump in the White House. And this most definitely signals that Israel and the United States will resume airstrikes against Iran. And we will see an increase in the escalation ladder in this war in the Middle East. So what's this happening? And it's happening because there are four major factions in this anti-Iran coalition that's driving this war. The first faction in this coalition, of course, are the Christian Zionists who are trying to achieve biblical prophecy. Then you have the Zionists who want to achieve the Greater Israel Project, which they believe It's a promised land that Yahweh gave to the Israelite people as part of the covenant together. And this is made explicit in the Bible. The third faction is the global financial elite, Wall Street, the city of London. Because for them, if they're able to control Iran, the sort of hummus, they're able control not only the vast oil reserves of Iran but also global trade. Thus negating the BRICS project, thus negating China's Silk and Road project. Then you have the American Empire, the military industrial complex, the deep state, whatever you want to call these people. But they are first and foremost interested in maintaining American hegemony. And if they're able to control the entire Middle East, then they will be able to maintain this unipolar world. Now when I say that these four factions are working together, you may think that they are in a dark smoke-filled room in an underground bunker in Washington, D.C. somewhere. And that's not what's happening. In fact, it's entirely possible. They don't even talk to each other. So let me give you a metaphor to explain to you how these four groups are working together. Let's just say that there's a mountain somewhere. And on this mountain, people believe that God lives on this mountain. Now the Christian Zionists want to build a road to this mountain top in order to be with God. Unfortunately, there are people who live on this mountain. They need to be exterminated. The war has to be fought. But it's all for the greater good because they will be able to be with God. The Zionists are involved because God and the Zionists know each other from history. And so the Christian Zionists need the Zionists involved in this project. They really see the Zionists as a ritual sacrifice in order to win favor with God. And the Christian Zionists are involved with building this world because they see the Christian Zionists as a useful tool in order to be with their true God. And so when they reach the mountain top, then their real God will recognize their faith and kill the Christian Zionists. So it's a cynical partnership between the Christian Zionists and the Zionists. And they both need each other for now until they reach the mountain top. Then you have the global financial elite. And these people are opportunists and speculators. They are first and foremost interested in generating more wealth for themselves and their clients. They themselves have no ideas. They themselves have no real vision for the world. They just want to make more money. And in the energy and the commitment and the faith of the Christian Zionists and the Zionists, they see an opportunity to monetize this faith. If the Christian Zionists and the Zionists are working hard to build this road to the mountain top, then they can provide financing for this road. Also, when this road is built, they can start to collect tow booths, right? So that's why they're involved, because they see this as a money making opportunity for them. They're only interested in making money. These people, Wall Street, London, they're so wealthy because all they care about is money. In fact, for the right price, they'd be perfectly willing to sell their own children. Okay, that's who these people are. Then you have the American Empire. The American Empire, it's important to understand that these are first and foremost bureaucrats. They have really cushy jobs, sitting in an office somewhere, pretending to work. And they need to justify their existence. They need to explain why they have children's dollars in their budget. And so this Christian Zionist project to reach the mountaintop provides the certification. They can say, okay, well, you know what? If it's Christian Zionist, the Zionist, if they're the ones who are gonna go and lobby the politicians and bribe the politicians and pressure the politicians to build this road, then we'll say that we'll provide military protection in order to justify our existence. Okay, so they're trying to do as little work as possible in order to maintain their very cushy jobs, sitting somewhere in an air-conditioned office. And that's it. Now, that's a structure of their relationship with each other. They're all interested in reaching that mountaintop for different reasons, but once they reach that mountaintop, then they'll have their disagreements. And how to reach that mountaintop, they won't be aligned with. So the example here is that the Christian Zionists and the Zionists are very much interested in using ground troops to force regime change in Iran. The financiers and the empire, they're risk adverse. So they really don't want to use ground troops. They want to achieve regime change slowly, steadily, in a way that contains risk. And so there's gonna be that disagreement about whether or not to use ground troops. In the end, I think the Christian Zionists and the Zionists will win out. So let me explain to you why, let me explain to you using game theory, why the Christian Zionists are the dominant power in this relationship, even though the financials control the money, and even though the American Empire controls the armaments. So here, let me introduce to you the universal law of game theory. Once you master this formula, once you truly understand the ramifications, the nuances, the subtleties of this law, then you will have much more clear and deeper understanding of how the world works. And this formula, it's very simple. It goes like this. If you look at game theories, all games, the people who always win the game, they win because of this formula, which is mass times energy times coordination. All right, so mass is just a number of people times energy, which is the level of motivation of these people, times coordination, which is the ability of these people to work together, to achieve their end. Some things keep in mind about this formula. First of all, the different factors are not weighted equally. So, coordination is the most important factor, and it's weighted at least three times as much as mass. Then you have energy. And energy is what's second most important and it's weighted twice as much as mass. And depending on the game, the weightings can be different. But please keep this in mind, coordination is what really matters, followed by energy, followed by mass. So if I explain that, let me explain to you what each term means and how we can measure each factor to get a more mathematical understanding of this formula. Mass is just a number of people involved but what's important to measure is their cohesion, how much they like each other, how much they're willing to work together. So for example you look at Japan and China. Japan is much more cohesive society than China. So in terms of mass, Japan is actually stronger than China, even though China has 10 times or 5 times as many people as Japan. Then you look at energy. Energy is the level of motivation. And usually when we think of energy, we think of fiscal energy. But actually in this formula, it's mental energy that really matters. Because if you think about it, it's mental energy that is the most expensive. And so you need the most motivation in order to achieve mental energy. So let me give you an example of this. Let's just say there are two people. The first person, he's taking a hole in the ground for 12 hours a day for a whole year. Then you have another person who every day is seeking to improve himself. So he's constantly in the process of self-reflection, writing down his, the ways that he can improve and creating a strategy or formula for how he can improve himself. Well, according to this formula, a second person is expecting much more energy than the first person, even though if we just look at it, it seems like it's the first person that's doing all the work and second person just sitting around all day just thinking. And the reason why is, in the world, The three hardest words to say for a human being is, I am wrong. To say I'm wrong is to negate yourself, to negate your ego, to admit that you have failings. To say you are wrong is also to commit to a policy of self-improvement, self-change. It's also tremendous loss of faith to say I'm wrong before your peers. You lower your status, you lose face. And that's why people who are more energetic, who are more motivated, they are much more open to change. They're much more willing to accept their limitations. They're much more willing to commit to self-improvement. So energy is a measure of motivation. And we can measure motivation by a group's openness to accepting its limitations, its failings. Okay, so that's the idea of energy. Then the third aspect of this formula is the idea of coordination. And coordination can be divided into two different types. The first type is conscious coordination. Second type is subconscious coordination. Conscious coordination is when you're led by someone. It could be a leader, it could be a bureaucracy, it could be a patriarch. Subconscious coordination is when there's no clear leader or clear direction, people just subconsciously work together. It's almost like a dance. And other two subconscious coordination is the more powerful. When people get together and they sort of conspire together, that leads to all sorts of problems. You don't want conspiracy. You don't want open conspiracies. So I'm going to explain to you why open conspiracies or secret conspiracies are bad policy. The first reason is it's really hard to maintain the secrecy of conspiracy. Eventually watching the leak out that these people are conspiring together. And the word leaks out that these people are conspiring together that forces other people to conspire together in this game. So if you are conspiring together, you have to keep it secret in order to maintain your advantage, but it's very, very hard to keep it secret. In fact, you probably waste more time and energy keeping it secret than you do in actually trying to implement your conspiracy. Okay, so that's the first reason why conspiracies are not a good idea. Second reason is in most games, conspiracies are illegal. It's considered cheating. So you lose possibility and liability when you are conspiring together and when you're keeping notes and when you're meeting in a room together and plunge together. The third reason is the most important. Okay, the third reason why you don't want to conspire together is everyone has an ego. Everyone is trying to maximize his or her self-interest in a conspiracy. And that immediately leads to friction, conflict, debate. So this creates friction in the relationship. So subconscious coordination is much more powerful than conscious coordination. It allows for frictionless cooperation and allows for plausible deniability and allows for secrecy. So examples of subconscious coordination are families, ethnicities, religions, okay? So, having said that, okay, having presented this formula, mass times energy times coordination, I want to now give you some examples to understand why this formula works. Okay, so let's just say we're playing individual games. Well, if we're playing an individual game, one versus one, then the formula is like this, Mass becomes one, coordination becomes one, so we're only left with energy. So what this form is telling us that in an individual player game, the person who is most motivated, the person who is most willing to commit to self-improvement will win this game. And the idea of constant self-improvement confirms the research of Kate Anders Erickson. He coined the phrase, do the practice, And he argues that those who are most proficient in individual activities, whether it's music, sports, are those who are most committed to a policy of self-reflection and self-improvement because that is the hardest thing to do. Now, let's look at team sports. In team sports, the mass is constant so we can actually take out mass. And what we're left with is the idea of energy times coordination. So in a team sport, the team that is most likely to win are the teams that are most willing to coordinate together subconsciously and most willing to commit to constant self-reflection and self-improvement. And let's look at the third example, which is what is an example of the most powerful grouping in human history and that of course is the nation state. The nation state is the most powerful form of human organization in the world. And if we just use this formula and analyze all nation states around the world, what we will discover is that there are four nation states that are dominant in each region. So in the western hemisphere is obviously United States. In Europe it's going to be Germany. And Europe, Germany is the most dominant nation state according to this formula. In Southeast Asia, it's Japan, and in the Middle East it is Israel. So over time over the next 10, 20, 30 years, we're going to expect these four nation states to dominate each region as the world loses unipolarity and moves towards multipolarity. Okay, so now I wanna discuss how to maximize this formula. Remember, the trick is how do you create subconscious coordination in your team? And believe it or not, the answer is to have a really powerful story. A powerful story, it's a way to frame your understanding of the world and it's also script. It allows you to understand how to behave in a certain context. All right, so let me explain to you the power story. All right, let's do a thigh experiment first. Let's imagine that we have the power to present every single story in human history to every single person who's ever lived and who is still alive today. And the stories we present include Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Disney movies, Homer, the Iliad, the Bible, every single story that humans have ever produced is presented to every single person. And then 10 years from now, we talk to every single person again and figure out what story that person most remembered and tablet the results. We do so, then what we will discover is that most people will have remembered three stories. The first story is Plato's Allegory of the Cave. The second story is the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. The third story is the second coming of Jesus. So let me explain all three stories. So please, I'll go with the cave. It's interesting because it's really Plato's reimagining of the trial of Socrates. For him, his mentor Socrates, who was four-strict hemlock by Athenians for the crime of corrupting the youth of Athens. For Plato, Socrates was his truth teller who discovered the truth of the world through philosophy. And he came in himself to revealing this truth to Athenian people. and response the Athenian people condemned him to death. Because as I mentioned previously, no one likes to say, I'm wrong. And no one likes to be told they're wrong. The second story, the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, it's interesting because it is actually a reimagining of Plato's allegory of the cave because Jesus was this truth teller sent by God to earth to reveal the truth of the universe to people in response we killed Jesus. Okay so the algorithm cave and the crucifixion of Jesus it's really just one story. The second coming of Jesus is really compelling because it's marking the end of history. It's telling us when everything will come to an end and and when we will have a chief paradise and reconciliation with God. So these three stories that are most memorable, it's really just one story. And it's appealing to us because as humans, we're born with three questions embedded in our hearts and our soul. The first question is, where do we come from? Second question is, why are we here? Third question is, where are we going? And the power of these three stories, there was the Algarve of the Cave, the Christopher of the Sixth Kingdom of Jesus, the Second Coming of Jesus, it's really helping us answer all three questions in a compelling and convincing manner. And that's why Christian Zionism is so powerful, because it's the most powerful story out there. That's why there's so many Christians. That's why Christian Zionists are the most energetic, the most motivated, the most committed people that you can ever meet. And again, a story, it is really a script. As a Christian Zionist, you want to achieve the story. It is so compelling, so powerful to you as a person. In fact, you're willing to sacrifice your own life in order to achieve this story. That's how beautiful it is. And that explains to us, that helps us understand why Christian Zionism is the most powerful force in the world today. Because for the people who believe in Christ's Zionism, they feel as though they discovered the secret universe and they must bring this story into fruition, into reality. Now, next thing I wanna talk about is, if it is true that this story, the crucifixion of Jesus and the second coming, such a powerful story, then in theory, we should have seen the story, we should have seen people try to achieve the story before. And also it's telling us that the story, Christus Ionism will never ever go away. It will continue until the end of human history. So what I will do now is tell you that actually 1500 years ago, they also tried to achieve the completion of this story. So 1500 years ago, about 600 common era, there was this massive war going on between the two major powers of that age, the Baiqing Empire based in Constantinople, and then you have the Sanshenean Persian Empire. And this war just devastated the entire world. People were dying, people were starving, people were in debt, people were in slavery. There was religious persecution. It really felt like the end times, the end of days. Also at this time, the Jews were banned from Jerusalem, which is their holy city. It's the city of their God Yahweh. And so the Jews in the diaspora were plotting throughout all this time how to return to Jerusalem. They were kicked out of Jerusalem because many centuries before, they had fought three major rebellions against the Roman Empire. And in each time, the Jews lost because we're fighting the Roman Empire. And each time, the Jews went to the desert of Arabia. Why did these armies, these defeated armies go into the desert of Arabia? Because the Romans really hated sand. They could only be safe in the desert of Arabia. And when they went to the desert of Arabia, they went there with commitment to eventually reclaim Jerusalem. To wait for the arrival of the Messiah to lead them to the final victory against the Romans. And while they were in the desert of Arabia, they were interacting with the local Arab pagans. And in this interaction, there's a process of synchronization, where Jewish belief was being meshed into Arab pagan belief. But as I told you, the most compelling story always wins out. So eventually the Jewish belief that the Messiah would eventually come to create the mediating age of truth, justice. Eventually it won over the Arab people. And this would become the foundation for the modern belief of Islam. And so during this time, there's widespread belief in the Arabian desert that Amaziah will eventually come to unite the Jewish people and lead them into final victory against the Roman Empire, which at this time had not become the Bosnian Empire. Back in the Jewish diaspora, they were trying to figure out how to return to Jerusalem. One group in the Jewish diaspora allied themselves with the Persians who promised them that they would, like Cyrus the Great, take them back to Jerusalem and build the third temple for them. And at first they succeeded. The Persians were able to conquer Jerusalem and the Jews were able to reclaim the city for themselves. And they were now in the process of building the third temple. The problem though is that at this time in history, the majority of the population were actually Christians. So the Christians rebelled against the Jews and then the Christians call for help to the Byzantine Empire. At this time, a new general, Heraklius, had emerged and he had usurped the throne from the emperor. And so the emperor, so not a new emperor, Heraklius, he has a legitimacy problem. And so he decided like the best way to prove that he in fact has the meaning of heaven, that he has the will of God supporting him. He decides that he has to reclaim Jerusalem and basically massacre all the Jews. So at this time in history, it seemed all hope was lost. Jews were being massacred. It seems like the Antichrist, heroclius, has emerged to destroy the Jewish nation. Now, the funny thing about Jewish eschatology is that when all hope seems lost, when the Antichrist has emerged, when the Jewish nation is about to be completely destroyed, that's when Jewish people are most convinced the Jewish Messiah will emerge to lead them into war and the final victory against the Antichrist and usher in the Masaic Age Where they will reconstruct the nation of Israel bring everyone home from the Jewish diaspora build the third temple and create a millennium of peace truth and justice so The Jews go into Arabian desert and now they're looking for their Messiah the promised Messiah And they're different candidates, but ultimately they settled on one charismatic man who is absolutely convinced that he is in fact Jewish Messiah. We don't know his name. Okay. A lot of his biography has been lost to us over the course of history. But today we refer to him as Mohammed. Mohammed was the Jewish Messiah. The Jews were looking to him to lead them into final victory against the Byzantines and the Antichrist, Heraclius. And he took up the call. And according to game theory, all he had to do was say three things, and he would unite the entire world behind him. And once he did so, he would become a tidal wave to wash over the old order and build the Mexican Age. All he had to do was say three things. The first thing he had to say was, I am the Jewish Messiah. I am the fulfillment of the prophecy. I am the promised one. I am the anointed one. Okay, that's the first thing. Second thing he needed to say is that we are all the children of Abraham. Jews, Christians, Muslims, we are all sent from Abraham. And as such, we are all the children of God. And as such, this land was promised to us by God and therefore debt, slavery, lendlessness, it's all evil in the eyes of God and therefore we must create a revolution to ensure that everyone has land, that debt is canceled, that slavery is eliminated from this world. So that's why I'm here. I'm the Messiah to lead us to final victory in the pursuit of the Mesopotamian age. The third thing that Mohammed had to say in order to unite the world is all these religious differences are idiotic, Zoroastrianism, Catholic, Christianity, Nestorian Christianity, Orthodox Christianity, Judaism. It does not that these factions are against the will of God. We are all the children of God and therefore we can all celebrate God in our own way. These factions, these divisions only exist for the priest class to exploit us, for the emperor, for the political class to unite, to conquer, to divide and conquer us. So you are free to separate your religion, you're free to separate God, your faith, in any way you seem fit. Okay, and this is what eventually led to something called the Cauchy of Medina, where one of the founding ideologies of Islam is religious tolerance. You are free to practice your faith in any way. You're free to love God in any way. And because he said these three things, Muhammad would lead the world's first global revolution against the established order and thus creating the basic structure of Islam. Unfortunately, Muhammad died before he could complete his mission, but that didn't stop many Jews from believing that he was in fact the Jewish Messiah. Because in their eyes, the prophecy has been fulfilled. First of all, the Arabs were able to conquer Jerusalem and return the Jews to Jerusalem. Thus we constitute the nation of Israel. Second of all, they built the third temple. Today we call it the Aksak Mosque. It's still there in Jerusalem. You can still visit it. But back then they thought it was a third temple. The third thing is they did usher in a millennium of peace, prosperity, truth, justice. Today we call it the Islamic Golden Age. So for many Jews, the prophecy happened fulfilled and that's why many Jews converted to Islam during this process. And many Jews would emerge as the top administrators, the top officials of the Islamic Golden making tremendous contributions to world civilization in the process. Unfortunately, what we also know about this period is that the early followers of Muhammad, called the companions, they were all basically eliminated in the power struggle that emerged after the death of Muhammad. Okay? I know that for many of you, this is extremely controversial history and I don't have enough time to go into the specific details. So what I will do is in the description below, I'm going to link a really awesome paper written by two Jewish religious historians about this time so you can have a better understanding of how Muhammad really is the Jewish Messiah. I'm also going to link to have a lot of like Wiki links so you can do some more background research into this period. It's really fascinating. And I apologize, I don't have enough time to go into more details about this period. Okay, okay. So to summarize, according to game theory, the universal law of game theory, Christian Zionists will emerge as dominant power in the Middle East. The other ones driving US policy right now, they will eventually overwhelm both the American Empire and the global financial elite. They will force the United States and ground troops and invade Iran in order to implement regime change. And they will basically get whatever they want. So it seems as though we forgot history. It seems we're able to predict the future by using game theory properly and systematically, and honestly, we're able to have a very clear insight into the trajectory of history. The problem though is game theory is not that easy. Why? Because according to game theory, when it seems like they structure the game, when there seems to be a trajectory, when the players are obvious in their moves, when there's certain inability to, that this is making of certain players, what will happen is a new player will emerge who see the contours of the game being played and he will manipulate events and change the course of this game to benefit himself and his group. Okay, now, Hegel's name for this person, the player is the world historical figure. Nietzsche's name for this player is the Ubermuts. The Superman, the person who was able to step outside of history and control the reigns of history in order to achieve his own ends. And by doing so, he's able to forever change the course of human history. Now, according to game theory, now that the game, the structure of the game has been, it's pretty clear, the overmints will now emerge. And in fact, today we do have the overmints. And this overmints will manipulate the game in order to achieve his vision. And he will change forever, change the course of human history. And this person's name is Vladimir Putin. So in my next video, I'm going to discuss who Vladimir Putin really is, what he wants and how he will achieve his vision. So thank you for today. I hope you enjoyed the talk and I'll continue the talk next week. Also some of you in the comment section have been telling me how much you want to support my work and I'm really grateful for it and I would really appreciate your support. So what I've done is I've set up a, bought me a coffee account. So you don't have to do it. I'm committed to educating you for free. You don't have to pay me anything. You don't have to give me anything. But I would really appreciate it if you have the means to buy me a coffee. The link is down below. So thanks a lot. And I will see everyone next time."}

Today we are doing the crusades, which will lead us into the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the Simon Revolution. Okay? Three questions we are looking at today are, what are the crusades? Second question is, why did they happen? The third question is, why did they stop? Okay, those are the three major questions we are looking at today. In order for me to explain the answers, I first need to provide a lot of background. First of all, is in the beginning of Christianity, in the Bible, the early Christianity was a religion of two things, humility and poverty. So let me tell you story from the Bible to illustrate this. One day Jesus and his disciples were out preaching and then a young man comes to Jesus and says I loved your sermon I want to know how to be a better person and then Jesus says to him make sure you follow the Ten Commandments and the laws of the prophets. The young man says I'm a very pious man. I really do this. I want to do more. And then Jesus says to him, then do this. Give up all your wealth. Give your wealth to the poor and then follow me. And then you will have all the treasure in the kingdom of heaven. The young man was really distraught because he was very very wealthy and he He didn't want to give up his wealth, so he walked away. Then Jesus turned to his disciples and he said, it is easier for camel to go through the eye of a needle, which is say it's impossible, okay? Then for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Okay, so here Jesus is negating wealth. And this is a revolutionary idea at that time because for people in the Western world, the entire point of believing in God, the entire point of making sacrifices to your gods is to have more wealth in life, right? How do you know if God favors you? Well, you become wealthy, alright? So what Jesus is saying here is revolutionary, meaning you should live a pious life so that you may enjoy a good life in heaven. So that's the heart and soul of the Christian religion and what makes it different from previous religions. That said, the Catholic Church is probably the wealthiest and most powerful religious organization ever in human history. You have absolutely no idea how wealthy the Catholic Church is. Their wealth is immeasurable. This is St. Peter's Basilica, the church in the Vatican where the Catholic Church is based. Inside this church is a lot of gold, a lot of gold. So in its thousand years, closer to thousand years of history, The Catholic Church has a mass more money than God. All right? So how do we explain this contradiction? How is it that the Catholic Church was able to amass so much wealth? OK, so as we discussed, after the fall of Rome, the Catholic Church basically became the new Roman Empire. After the fall of Rome, for the longest time, Europe was poor. But starting about the year 1000, Europe became increasingly wealthy for a variety of reasons. The main reason is something called the medieval warm period, meaning it was just easier to grow crops. That followed the invention of the water mill, windmill and horse cover, which made it easier for people to grow crops. This is what we call the mini-agulatory revolution. Because of this excess wealth, you saw the rise of cities, urban centers. And this allowed Europe to start trading with the rest of the world, primarily the Abbasid Caliphate, which we discussed last week. And as such, Europe became increasingly wealthy. But what's important for us to remember is, with wealth comes inequality. So this also marks the high point of feudalism. You have too many people, too little land, and as a result, you have feudalism, where the nobility controls all the land, the peasants became poor, dependent, and often indebted. So as you can see, these are the major city centers of Europe at this time. The wealthiest city in Europe is still Constantinople, right? But you have Rome, London, Paris, all emerging as major manufacturing and urban centers. What's important, first remember, also is that around this time, one of the wealthiest parts of Europe is Spain, okay? This is important because Spain is a Christian. It's Muslim in the year 1000, all right? And this will create conflict between Europe and Spain. All right, so how was the church able to amass so much power during this time? Well, because the church pioneered a new way of controlling people that was not possible before, okay? So to illustrate this point, let's compare an empire with the church, the Catholic church. First question, who's in charge? Well, in an empire, the emperor is in charge, but it's a human being who is flawed and mortal. He will eventually die. He's also subjective. People understand that he will make mistakes. So that's why you must appeal to him. You must try to convince him. But with the Catholic Church, the person in charge is God, who is perfect, immutable, and eternal. He can never make a mistake, and he will always be there. Okay? The second difference is an empire demands labor from you. It demands that you toil and sweat. But the church demands your soul, your eternal spiritual obedience, your heart and your mind, okay? And the third major difference is an empire can only put you to death as the worst punishment, But the church can send you to eternal damnation. The church can have you burn in hell for eternity. And so this concept of eternal damnation is the source of a lot of the church's power. So the church has something called a faith monopoly. It was the only religion, it was a true religion. And so there are certain ways that this power would express and benefit itself in Europe at this time. I'm going to have to go through a lot. This is a lot of information. I apologize. But you will need to know this in order for us to go on in the course. This is especially important for the Protestant Reformation. Because the Protestant Reformation will be a rejection of a lot of these practices. All right, so the first thing you need to understand of the church in about the year 1000 is it's an imperial bureaucracy the Pope is basically the emperor and then each region has Bishops that control the region. It's a huge bureaucracy. That's not that's very similar to the bureaucracy in Katsana pole as well as in China. Okay, so top-down hierarchy second thing you need to know is The official language of the church was Latin. During church services, the priests would give sermons in Latin. The Bible was written in Latin. The purpose for this is to tell people that the Bible, that theology was not for them. They just had to listen and obey. So that gave the priests a lot of power. It was also an explicit rule that only priests could preach the Bible. You had to be ordained and authorized by the church in order to be able to tell what Christianity meant. You had to recite Nicene Crete, which is a holy trinity. So remember we discussed the holy trinity, the idea of monotheism, and this is the dominant belief system of the church. There's something called the sacraments, okay? Seven holy sacraments that you must pay for. And these are rituals provided to you by priests in the church. What these rituals are trying to do is they're trying to channel the divine energy of heaven and Jesus and God in order to make your life much more fortunate, okay? So an example of this is called the Eucharist. And so when the Eucharist employs principle of transmutation. So during the Eucharist and it's a basic common meal, what the priest will do is he will channel Jesus from heaven and his body will become expressed in bread. The bread will become the body of Jesus and then his blood will benefit itself in wine or water. And then you you will feast on the bread and wine. You eat Jesus, you drink Jesus, and Jesus comes into you. Right? And if this sounds weird, it is weird. And that's why a lot of Protestants will rebel against this. They think it's superstitious. Right. You also have the church determining who goes to hell, heaven, and purgatory, as well as for how long. Hell is where you burn for all eternity, heaven is where you are with God. Purgatory is if you commit sins and you need to cleanse yourself of these sins. So you might be in purgatory for like one year if you steal, but you might also be there for a thousand years if you killed someone. And the church, it's up to the church to determine how long you're in purgatory for. There's something called the canonization of saints where the church can determine who are saints. A lot of Protestants in the future will say this is wrong because only the Bible, only Jesus can determine who is worthy. The church doesn't have the power to determine this. The last thing is, and this is really important, the authority of the clerics was absolute. And heretics were those who denied the absolute authority of the church. Okay? So this is important because some people think that heretics are those who disagree with the church. For example, they don't really understand the nisyn creed. Well, if you don't understand something, it's called ignorance or superstition, you understand? And therefore the church has a responsibility to educate you. Once a church educates you and you still refuse to omit the authority of the church, then you become a heretic, which means you will become excommunicated. Okay, excommunicated means that you will be kicked out of the community of the church, which means you will burn in hell forever. As well, you could also be burned at a stake for being a heretic, okay? Does that make sense? So these are the sources of the power of the church. As you can see, at this time, the Catholic Church is a very elitist, very aloof, and very distant religion. It's designed in a way to be removed from the ordinary struggles of ordinary people. So as you can imagine, with so much power comes corruption. Augustine, in the city of God, he basically imagined the intellectual blueprint for the Catholic Church. He believed the Catholic Church had to be this eternal spiritual force that represented God on Earth. So what was really important was for the church to focus on spirituality. With power, the church slowly became more corrupted. So let's look at some instances of corruption that were legal practices at this time. The first is the idea of indulgence. And this means that maybe you committed a lot of sins, but you have a lot of money. What you can do is bribe the church to make your stay in purgatory shorter. This is basically bribery, spiritual bribery. And obviously a lot of Christians would have issues with this. Second is the idea of simony. Simony just means that if you're rich, you can buy yourself into the church, regardless of your education, regardless of your understanding of the theology. Okay, this is called simony. Then you have something called the selling of holy relics. So again, at this time, everyone's very superstitious. So they wanna buy relics in order to channel the divine power of Jesus, right? Well, the church would sell these relics and a lot of them would be fake. But a lot of Christians, as you can imagine, would find the very idea of the church engaging in commerce to be very offensive. Worldliness means that you have the conjoining, the conflation of the nobility with the church. So a lot of princes became bishops. Canes could pick who could become bishops. And priests were supposed to be celibate. They were supposed to devote their life to God. But a lot of them got married, had kids, and owned property and became very wealthy. So a conflation of the nobility and the church, a conflation of temporal power with spiritual power. TIFFS means that prisoners had to pay taxes. Prisoners had to pay taxes to not only the nobility, but also to the church as well. And the very last idea is the idea of feudalism. And this means that the church controlled at its height one third of all the land in Christian Europe. And they didn't have to pay taxes to the nobility, to the prince. So as a result of all these, of all this corruption and special privilege, the church became the most powerful organization in all of Europe. And again, they had this power because people were afraid of burning in hell for eternity. Even kings were afraid. But we have to remember this. This is very important. Ultimately if you're a church, your power, your legitimacy, your authority comes from your ability to enforce your belief system on everyone. This is what I call orthodoxy. The church must enforce right thinking, correct thinking on people. If people disagree, if an increasing number of people disagree, then your authority, your power will decrease. Now at this time in the year 1000, there are five sources of conflict for the church. Okay? Five things that will question the legitimacy of the church. The first thing is this. Muslims occupy the holy land. Jerusalem right now is being controlled by the Fatimids, which is an Islamic caliphate. And this is embarrassing, right? Because if you are the true representative of God on earth, why is Jerusalem being controlled by the Muslims? Okay, that's embarrassing. Second problem is, Muslim Spain, okay? It's more wealthy, more cosmopolitan and innovative than Christian Europe. A lot of the reason why is, Muslim Spain, it is much more open, inclusive, and tolerant than the Catholic Church. It also trades with the rest of the Muslim world. And as we know from this, I'm a Golden Age lecture, the Muslim world right now is very, very wealthy. Jews, Christians, and Muslims all get along very fine in Muslim Spain, okay? So, and it's just right next door. Everyone can see that Muslim Spain, it's much more wealthy. So that's another problem. A third problem is something called the Great Shishim of 1054. That's when the Greek Orthodox Byzantine church in Constantinople, it broke away, it split away from the Roman Catholic church in Rome. Now you have two different churches, all claiming to be the one true church of Jesus. That's a huge problem. Another problem, of course, is the corruption that we just discussed. The conflation of spiritual power with temporal ambition. Now the last problem is this. The last problem is the set. Now, something that we discussed a lot last semester is that humans are first and foremost religious. Humans have religious needs, and these religious needs often trump their material needs. For example, food, water, and shelter. Humans have a fundamental need for community, intimacy, and truth. But the Catholic Church is denying intimacy and truth to humans. Humans want to be with God. They want to serve God. But the Catholic Church says, no, we are the middlemen. to go through us in order to celebrate God. So there's a lot of discontent at this point in Christian Europe against the Catholic Church. So these are five problems. And again, the Catholic Church, the entire source of their power is their ability to maintain Orthodoxy. So they developed a three-prong strategy that they will use basically a lot throughout the history of Europe. These three-fung strategies are scapegoating, persecuting and crusading. And you guys need to know this because these three ideas will recur over and over in European history. The idea of scapegoating is this. In Europe at this time, even though the Jewish community is a lot smaller, it's still present. Okay, now the question then is, what are the Jews still doing in Europe? And the answer is, well, a lot of them are working for the nobility. The nobility inherit their wealth, but they don't wanna do any work. They don't want to match your land. They don't wanna run their business. They don't wanna collect taxes. And they don't want to run their banks. So they get Jews to do this for them. because Jews are clever, they're hardworking, but most importantly, they're completely dependent on the protection of nobility. Does that make sense? Because at this point in Christian history, remember the Catholic Church teaches Christians that the Jews were responsible for persecuting Jesus. And therefore Christians really don't like Jews. So if Jews want to stay in Europe, if they want to stay together as community, they are completely dependent on the protection of nobility. And as such, they essentially become slaves to nobility. They have no choice but to serve the nobility. This is bad for them because the peasants don't like being exploited by the nobility. Remember, this is a feudal system where peasants are too poor and too indebted to the nobility. But in their day-to-day interactions, who do they work with? They work with Jews. Jews are the ones who come and collect taxes for nobility. Jews are the ones who sell them goods. So what happens over time is the peasants, the resentment against nobility, is channeled towards the Jews. So whenever there's a major conflict, guess who gets killed. Guess who gets persecuted. It's a Jews, all right? And this is a pattern that will be consistent for basically all of European history, up until the Holocaust. If you want to understand what the Holocaust happened, this is why it happened, okay? There's a long-term enmity, hatred, of the European people against the Jews, created by the nobility, all right? When the conflict becomes too intense, what will happen is the nobility will protect themselves by expelling the Jews. So in 1492 Spain expelled the Jews, but before that the Germans expelled the Jews in 1100, France in 1306. But before then you have these massacres going on all around Europe. So the, I'm not sure if you ever see the black skull, but that's this massacre of Jews. Okay? All right, so being a Jew means to be constantly persecuted. And again, they're being scapegoated by the Catholic Church in order to reduce tensions between the nobility and the peasantry, all right? So that's the first mechanism. Then you have the crusades. All right, so to understand the crusades, let me get some historical background. In the year 638, the Muslims take over Jerusalem from the Byzantine Empire. They conquer it. And once they take it over, they make Jerusalem into an open, inclusive, and tolerant religious community where Christians, Jews, and Muslims can celebrate their religion openly. So after that, what Christians have to do is make these pilgrimages to Jerusalem. And for most of this history, it's fine. There are no issues. But what will happen is, as the Byzantine Empire becomes weaker and the Abbasid Caliphate becomes weaker, there's now chaos. And as such, bandits roam the land. And pilgrims find it more and more dangerous to venture into Jerusalem. Okay, does that make sense? All right? So now it's become much more dangerous for Christians to venture into Jerusalem because of all the internal chaos going on in the Muslim land. The people who are creating all this chaos are called the Seljuk Turks. Last class we talked about the rise of Genghis Khan, right? What I said last class is the step people are always invading agricultural empires. So the Turks, they are based in Central Asia and then slowly over time they will conquer the Abbasic caliphate. And in 1071 they will begin to occupy Jerusalem. And the Turks leave Jerusalem alone but because of this conflict what's happening is the way to do it's much more dangerous. As well, the Turks are now threatening Byzantium, okay, Constantinople right here. In fact, they're conking a lot of territory in around Constantinople. And as such, the emperor of Constantinople, the Byzantine emperor, he appeals to Pope Orban II, who was the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Can you please help me and save me from these Seljuk Turks? And so what Pope Orban II will do Remember, popes are politicians. He sees the opportunity here to unite Christianism under the authority of Rome, right? He sees the opportunity to reclaim Jerusalem as Christian territory. He sees the opportunity to channel the religious energies of the present tree against the Muslims, okay? So what he does is, in the year 1095, he will give a speech calling for the first crusade, which begins the crusading period. Now we're gonna look at very closely at this speech, and it's important we do because this rhetoric, this philosophy will underpin the relationship between Christians, Muslims, and Jews for most of European history, okay? So let's see how the Pope thinks. All who die, by the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the pagans, shall have immediate remission of sins. The pagans are non-Christians. the Muslims, the Jews. So what the Pope is calling for is a jihad. All good Christians now must go into battle to reclaim Jerusalem. If you do so, you'll be granted immediate access to heaven regardless of what you did and how you sin. Doesn't make sense, guys. This is a jihad. He's calling for jihad. The concept people think comes from the Islamic world. It's very much a Christian concept of jihad where if you go to Jerusalem and you die, you're going straight to heaven. You'll be right beside God. Now he also says, oh what a disgrace if such a despised and base race which worships demons. A despised and base race which worships demons. He's talking about the Muslims. Muslims don't worship demons. was the same God as the Jews and the Christians. In fact, a lot of their religious practice is similar to the Christians and Jews. When Muhammad and the Muslims came to conquer the Holy Land, they did so in a peaceful manner. Okay? They tried to reduce as much bloodshed as possible. And here Pope Urban II, he He spread racism against the Muslims. In fact, what the rumors are is that in Jerusalem, Christian women are being enslaved. Christians are being massacred and kicked out of Jerusalem. Christians are no longer allowed into Jerusalem. These are all rumors. They're all fake. They're not true. But Pope, over the second, he is trying to whip up this racist anger at the Muslims. conquer a people which has the faith of Omnipotent God and is made glorious with the name of Christ. It is embarrassing for us as Christians that the Muslims control Jerusalem. We must fix this. All right, let's continue. Let those who have been accustomed unjustly to wage private warfare against the faithful now go against the infidels and end with victory this war which should have been begun long ago. Why did we wait so long to reclaim Jerusalem? They've had it since 638. It's now the year 1095. Why are we fighting ourselves? Why is there war in Europe? We should all be going to the Holy Land and kill all the Muslims. Okay? Again, this is important that we read because this rhetoric, this logic, this emotion is is going to basically justify the age of conquest, exploration, and imperialism, which we'll follow after this, okay? Let those who for a long time happened robbers now become knights, okay, do you understand? You could be the lowest person on earth, you could be a thief, but if you go on a crusade, you are now a nobleman, you are now a knight, you are now a hero, a valiant hero for Christianity. Let those who have been fighting against their brothers and relatives now fight in the proper way against the barbarians. Okay? Let those who have been serving as mercenaries for small pay now obtain the eternal reward. This is what he's saying. If you go on this crusade, regardless of who you are, you will be honored by God. You will receive eternal reward. regardless of what you did, okay? You could be the worst criminal in Europe, it doesn't matter. Once you go on this crusade, you will be saved, right? So he makes this bargain with the people of Europe. And as you can imagine, there's a groundswell of excitement, okay? A lot of people go on this crusade against the Turks. All right, so let's summarize and look at the individual reasons why people are going on this crusade. It's a long way and it's very dangerous but they're very excited to go, okay, why? All right, so the first reason is penance. So a lot are violent people who have engaged in war, right? They go on this crusade, they will be forgiven for their sins. It's either you go on a crusade or you go join a monastery, okay? Clerical immunity. What this means is that if you are criminal, if you killed someone, If you go to crusade, you will be immune. You will be absolved of these crimes. So as you can imagine, a lot of psychopaths go on this crusade, a lot of criminals. Vengeance, people are hearing rumors that the Muslims are killing Christian women so they want to kill Muslim men, okay? Elite overproduction. So as we discussed, when a society becomes much more wealthy, you have a problem of elite overproduction. basically younger sons who cannot inherit any land. And so they must go on a crusade to win over their own land, okay? To obtain their own land and become nobility locally. Second coming, okay, what this means is that, okay, so in Christianity, there are many powerful ideas. The crucification of Jesus is a powerful idea, but the second coming is the most powerful idea. It's the idea that eventually Jesus will return and he will make the world anew. This is what drives a lot of Christians. And so a lot of Christians believe that this crusade, it's really the end of the world. It's a final battle between the believers and the non-believers. And Jesus will return to Jerusalem in order to fight on behalf of the believers and usher in a new world order. People actually believe this. Adventureism, romanism, shivery. Shivery means, shivery, okay. We didn't discuss this, but it's important that you know. Shivery is a code of honor among knights. The shivery, the principle, a lot of the principle is loyalty to your Lord. So if your Lord goes off on a crusade, you have to join him, okay? You have to be loyal to your master, to your Lord. Piety, fanatism, okay, and glory, okay? Why am I listening this? Because guys, these reasons are also what drives the Europeans into the new world. Later on, we were discussing the age of exploration, where the Spaniards, the Portuguese, the French, the British, they go into the new world. And they're going into the new world for these reasons. And a lot are going for with religious fever and religious energy. So it's important that you understand the complexity and diversity of reasoning. Okay, so as I mentioned, the year of 1095, Pope Urban II declares the first crusade. But over the course of the next 20 years, there'll be a series of crusades to maintain the Holy Land, okay? And it's a very complicated process because it's not being organized, okay? It's a very much a grassroots movement. Basically local lords are the ones organizing these crusades. And often peasants will go by themselves. And as you can imagine, as you can see, it's a very long way to Jerusalem, and a lot will get killed along the way. In the first crusade, the first crusade is extremely successful because at this point in history, the Muslims don't really care about Jerusalem. It's not that important to them. So the crusaders are able to take Jerusalem and they established something called the Crusader States. And it's very, very impressive that they do so because they're completely surrounded by Muslims and by enemies. But because of their religious fanaticism, they will maintain these crusader states for the next 200 years. So the blue the yellow are crusader states and as you can see the white is all Muslim territory all right in 1099 they take Jerusalem and as I mentioned There's a lot of religious finacism going on when the crusaders take Jerusalem. They do so with Vengeance they kill all the Muslims. They kill all the Jews They basically killed as many people as possible in the city before the siege the Thalamids who were in control of the city, they actually expelled the Christians because they were afraid that the Christians would help the Crusaders from inside. So no Christians were killed, but a lot of Jews, a lot of Muslims were killed. It was a very, very bloody event. And the Christians celebrate this. For them, this is righteous. to kill the enemy for the glory of God, it is righteous killing. This contrast with the year 1187, when the Muslim leader named Saladin, Saladin is considered one of the greatest warriors in human history, he celebrated both by Christians and Muslims, he takes Jerusalem without killing any Jews, Christians or Muslims. He does so peacefully. And again, what's important for us to remember is that historically, Christianity has been a very violent religion. And Muslims, there's a lot of violence, but it tends to be much more peaceful, open inclusive in Christianity. I'm not talking about today, but I'm talking about historically this has been true. Once they control Jerusalem, there are five major military orders of the Crusaders. You've probably heard of the Knights Templar. They're the most famous. But you also have a group called the Tartonic Knights who will go on to found a place called Precha which will unite Germany. So I want you guys to remember the Tartonic Knights because they will form the basis of partial society which will then unite Germany into modern day Germany. They come from different places in Europe and that's where there are five different military orders. The Knights Templars are the most famous and they become over time extremely influential and powerful. The reason why is they're really the first multinational organization in Europe. So they were meant to protect pilgrims along the way to Jerusalem. What they really did was pilgrims would give their money to the Templars for safekeeping. And then when they got to Jerusalem, the Templars would give them any back. So they were a bank. And as you can imagine, as a bank, they were able to make a lot of investments, they were able to trade. And as such, because they're bankers and they're traders, they are much more sophisticated, well-educated, and cost more politics than the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is an imperial bureaucracy, it only cares about maintaining orthodoxy over Europe. But the Knights Templars, they are bankers, they're traders. Also, once they take over Jerusalem and now they have to govern the city, they recognize that you need to work with Jews and Muslims. Okay, because Jews and Muslims have these business connections all around the Muslim world and they're surrounded by Muslims. So what will happen over time is the night Templars where we'll come back Jews and Muslims into Jerusalem. And over time, what will happen is, not only will these temples become much more tolerant, but they will start to learn from the Muslims and the Jews. And they will pick up better practices from these other religions. Also at this in Jerusalem are Christians who are considered heretics by the Catholic Church. These are Christians who disagree with the Holy Trinity and with other concepts, and that's why they went over to the Muslim world, okay? So what the time templates are doing is, they're absorbing all this diverse religious belief, and as such, they become essentially free thinkers, okay? They become, a lot of the religion now is based on reason and logic, because that's really the only way that you can manage this religious diversity, okay? Does that make sense? All right? So the night Templars really become one of the bases for modern Europe. But as you can imagine, these changes will come into contact with the Catholic Church. And as a result, in the year 1307, the Catholic Church begins to persecute the night Templars. They burn the leader, Jack de Molay, at the stake. They disband the organization. But by disbanding the organization, You try the organization underground, okay? And a lot of their beliefs will start to spread throughout Europe and it will incubate the Protestant Reformation and they will actually even influence the American Revolution, okay? We'll discuss this later when we get to the American Revolution. The reason for Jack Dumelie being burned is the Catholic Church accuses them of being Satan worshipers, all right? There's no evidence that they were Satan worshippers, but they were definitely free thinkers. They were definitely religiously tolerant, and that went against the orthodoxy of the Catholic Church. Does that make sense, guys? So now the Templars, I want you guys to remember, we'll be discussing them later on in the semester. This is just a quick introduction. All right, let's continue. All right, now, there are three different directions of the Crusades going on at the same time. The first direction is to recapture Jerusalem. The second is to reclaim Spain from the Muslims. At this point in history, Spain is called Al-Andalus. And you guys can still go to Spain and see a lot of this architecture. It's beautiful. It is extremely creative and it's very powerful. So this is An-Aldalus, the architecture. This is some of their buildings. Spain is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. definitely visit if you have a chance. Okay? Okay, this is a mosque. So Spain, again, was for the longest time the most wealthy, cosmopolitan, innovative place in Europe because it was open and inclusive. There were a lot of Jews, there were a lot of Christians and Muslims all working together in all the lens. Okay? This is a process that will take about 20 years where Europe will come and slowly conquer all of Spain. But this is also part of the Crusades. I won't go into history, but as you can see, it takes some time. All right, the last thing about the Crusades is they were also focused internally against the centers. And there were quite a few dissenters throughout this history. So let's go over some of the major groups. There are hundreds of different groups. I'm only gonna go through some of them. The first group I wanna talk about are the big wins and the big guards. The big wins refers to women. The big guards refers to men. How they come into conflict with the church is they want to restore early Christianity. They want to restore the heart and soul of Christianity as a religion of humility and poverty. So they live lives of extreme poverty and charity. They themselves live very simple lives and they give as much, they give everything that they have to other people, okay? So think of the story of the young man who approaches Jesus and Jesus tells him to give up everything. Well, that's what they do. A lot of them are pretty wealthy people and they give up everything in order to celebrate Christianity. Their problem is, First of all, they defied the authority of the church. So they filmed from their own communities. The second problem is if these guys are living simple lives, this contrasts with the clerics, right? Who are often fat, wealthy, and corrupt. So it's kind of embarrassing. So they were persecuted. Then you have a people called the Waltissians who also preached a life of poverty. The founder Peter Waldo was actually son of a very wealthy merchant who gave everything up in order to live in poverty and practice the Christian faith. Their problem though is they believe that the pope is the devil, okay? The Catholic church, it is evil because it's corrupting true Christianity. And as a result, a lot of them get burned at the stake, okay? is a crusade against them and they get decimated and destroyed. But they're still around even today. A lot of their beliefs are still around today. The main focus of the eternal crusade is something called the albogenesian crusade, which lasts about 20 years. So this is complicated. But in southern France in a place called Albi, this community practices something called catherism. is actually a pretty diverse belief, okay? But its main idea is this. They believe in dualism. They believe that this world that we live in, it was created by the devil. Why? Because this world is one of pain, one of torment, one of suffering. And there's no way that the true God would create a world like this. But the devil creates this world, and what What he did was, he stole souls from heaven and souls are pure, right? And he puts these souls into our bodies and that's what gives rise to humans. So we are these pure, divine souls in these corrupt, ugly, painful bodies. So the goal of life is to discover that we are in prison and escape our bodies and return to heaven through good works, through beliefs, through knowledge, okay, gnosis. So these people are also considered Gnostics. Their problem is not only are they heresy, but they have their own church structure, okay? They have their own church structure and this church structure is extremely open, tolerant, and inclusive. There are women inside the hierarchy, but there are also Jews inside the hierarchy. And what's important for us to remember is this is a belief system in which there aren't that many people, but they're deeply admired by the community because they call themselves good Christians. They practice a life of simplicity, of poverty. And they are kind and charitable to everyone. So the entire community sees them as good neighbors. So when the pope declares a crusade against these cathars, what happens is the entire community rallies around them and tries to protect them. Obviously, this is a community that is being besieged by European knights, and they will get killed. What's amazing is, while the community is protecting them, okay, and they know that the Crusades are only wants to kill the Cathars, not the Catholics, okay, they're Catholics, the Crusades doesn't want to kill them, but they're willing to sacrifice their lives protect the cathars but also a lot of them will convert to chatharism knowing that they will die because they are so disgusted by the crusades so discussed about the Catholic Church and they feel such a strong emotional bond with the cathars okay so this is a very violent process but it does not destroy chatharism why because these cathars don't care if they die remember we are inside crop bodies. So when we are martyred, we will go straight to heaven. So when they're burned at the stake, okay, they go willingly. They go happily. And this stunts their neighbors, the community, but it also frightens the Catholic Church, okay? Because like they know you can't beat people like this. And if you keep on persecuting them, their religion will spread. So the Catholic Church the church adopts two new strategies to deal with them. The first is they initiate something called the Franciscan Order, the friars, founded by the Francis of Assisi. And this is a brotherhood focused on a life of humility and poverty, doing good works. Just as Jesus said, the thing though is they're within the church hierarchy. obey the Pope and the Cathars didn't obey the Pope. The Valdesians thought the Pope was the devil. The main invention, the main response is something called the Dominican order. So you might have heard of the Jesuits, right? The Jesuits were created in order to persecute people during the Protestant Reformation. Well, the Dominican order was created just like the Jesuits in order to deal with the Cathar heresy. These are extremely well educated people who will now use the power of the pen rather than the power of the sword to try to crush the heresy. Okay? What's important for us to remember is these people who joined the Inquisition, the Crusade, they do so out of the pureness, the goodness of their own heart. The Cathars have been led astray. It is their responsibility to educate them and to save their souls before they burn in hell for all the turn it okay? They do so with compassion, with generosity, with mercy. And so they're fanatical about it. They are absolutely convinced that Cathars have been misled by the devil. So what they will do is they will go and interview Cathars and the entire community okay? Now before the community wanted to protect the Cathars So they will lie on behalf of the car-tharves. But with the power of the pen, you're able to write everything down. If you're able to take testimony, think of a police interrogation, you know exactly who's lying and who's telling the truth. So they were really quickly able to identify who was a car-thar and to isolate that person. And the power of the pen, this interrogation method, was far more effective than the crusades. So this is part of what we call the medieval Inquisition. And this is something that will repeat itself during the Spanish Inquisition, and the Inquisition against the Protestants, okay? Does that make sense? So again, there's this stereotype or this misconception that the Inquisition was a violent act. But there was very little violence and the reason why is the Catholic Church, the doctrine forbids them from spilling blood. So, but this was a very thorough, very effective way to deal with heretics, okay? All right, so what brings the Crusades to an end? Why did the Catholic Church start to lose power? Okay, so a lot of their power derives from the belief that they represent God, the legitimacy, right? Well, starting in the 14th century, there are a series of crises. Remember that for 300 years, Europe was in the medieval warm period. The weather was good, but guess what? Weather will change over time. So starting in year 1303, the little ice age begins. Basically, it rains every day, and it's very cold. So if you're a good Christian, what do you think? Well, you read the Bible, you know the Bible, and you know this is the flood, Noah's flood. God is angry at you guys. You guys committed sin. Who do you sin against? Probably the Calthars, probably the Waldisians. probably those who let good lives, and you know they like good lives, but you kill them anyway, okay? This leads to something called the Great Batman of 1315 or 1317, all right? And then this will lead to something called the Hundred Years War between France and England, okay? So all of Europe right now, they're either starving or they're at war, all right? And then this will create banan trees. So you have these mercenary groups, basically these packs of young men who go around killing people. And what does it? The final thing is something called a black death, which lasts from 1346 to 1353. This will kill at least half of the European population. At least half of the European population. So let's look at the black death. It starts in a place called Kurdish Stand today in Central Asia. And because of something called the Pax-Mangalaka. Remember, last class we talked about the Paxmangalaka, right? This disease was able to spread very quickly throughout the world. And because Europe at this time, it's poor. People are at war. People are starving. The plague decimates the population because people's immune systems are very weak, right? At least half of the people die, right? And at this point, people have lost faith in the Catholic Church. And so now you have rebellions going on. Also, and this is really important, the Catholic Church in 1378, it splits apart. It's in the remember in 1045, the Catholic Church split away from the Orthodox Church. But in 1378, the Catholic Church itself divides into two. There are now two popes. The first pope is in Rome, and he's supported by the countries in blue, which is Sweden, Denmark, England, Poland, Hungary, and Italy itself. But you also have a pope in Evonon who is supported by France, which is the rising power in Europe at this time. So this causes people to lose even more faith in the Catholic Church. So now you start to have these rebellions going on. So you have something called the docenians. And what they argue for, this is basically a revolutionary party. They argue for the fall of the church, the fall of feudalism. And they want to create an egalitarian society. So in other words, these are proto-communists. Even at this stage in human history, people are longing for, they're nostalgic for a time when humans were free, open, and egalitarian. They want to destroy the hierarchy. They want to destroy the feudal order. All right? This is John Wycliffe. He is an Englishman. He is a theologian. Why the respected? But he was critical of the church. And he wrote a lot of books promoting reform in the church. He believed that the priests had too much power. He believed that God should be returned to the people. And so he himself translated the Bible from Latin into the vernacular, into English so that the northern people can read it, okay? The, eventually the church deemed him a heretic, okay? They called him a heretic, but the problem is, at this point he's dead. So what they did was this, they dug up his body, and then they burned him out of the state, okay? Because that's what you do to your heretics. He was already dead, but they burned him anyway. John Huss is a Czech. He was in a place called Bohemia and was preaching the same things. And as a result, they decided to call me heretic and burn him at the stake. But this will lead to something called the Housik Wars when the local Bohemians will challenge the authority of the Catholic Church. Eventually, this rebellion, this war, will be crushed by the Catholic Church, but this will give way to another reformer by the name of Martin Luther. Martin Luther will start something called the Protestant Reformation. And this will end the authority of the Catholic Church in northern Europe and begin a new age for Europe. All right, so we'll discuss Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation next week. Okay, so let us conclude by answering the three questions. Why the Crusades? Why did they happen? Why did they stop? The Crusades in the Western imagination, it's no different from the Jihad in the Muslim imagination, it is a religious war. It's channeling all that religious energy against your opponent. And the Crusades, even though technically they end in 1290, they will benefit themselves in the age of exploration and in the conquest of the New World, which is something we'll discuss later on. Why did it happen? As I discussed, it happened because the Catholic Church had a legitimacy problem. The church was divided between East and West. There were the Muslims in Spain who were more open, more cosmopolitan. Jerusalem was controlled by the Muslims. There was internal dissent. So the church was trying to unite Christian in order to channel the religious energy and financialism in order to consolidate its power and authority over Europe. Okay? And why did they stop? Well, they stopped mainly because Europe found itself in internal turmoil in the 14th century. But you can also argue, and I'll show you later on, they never really stopped. It's still going on today. The wars in the Middle East that you're seeing on the news, it's really still part of the crusading mentality. So I know this is a lot, but any questions? Let's try to clarify some things that you didn't really understand. Yeah? Okay, sure. All right, let's talk about the Inquisition, okay? All right, the Inquisition. Sorry, let me, what can I open this? Oh, okay, all right, good. Okay, so, all right, so let me go over the Inquisition because it's very technical, okay? So in Europe at this time, there are two types of authority. There's something called clerical authority and something called secular authority. Clerical just means the church, Secular just means the nobility, the prince, who is in charge of that area. So the clerical authority passes judgment on you. Okay, it's only responsible for your spiritual life, not your physical life. The secular authority only cares about your physical life, not your spiritual life, okay? That's where the division is. So the secular authorities are those who have the power to kill you, okay? The secular authority are those who have the right, who have the power to declare you a heretic or an orthodox. So what's happening during the Inquisition? So the Inquisition is trying to figure out the truth or the soul. Because it is possible that your religion, for example, if you're a cathart, that you can lie. Why? Because this world is fake. Who cares? I'm fake, you're fake. As long as your soul is pure, that's what matters. So you try to look for these cathars, but they won't tell you the truth. But not only that, but the community was also protecting them. So what would happen is, they knew you were going to come in and ask questions. You would basically like the police, you want to interrogate them, right? Well, before then, the community would get together and make up a lot of lies, to protect the minority of cathars within that community. These are neighbors trying to protect each other. So what they would do is they would have these informants who tell them maybe one and three, person one and three in this community of 10. They are cathars. So now the problem is, how do you find them out? Well, what you do is, like the police, you would interrogate them individually. And because the Dominicans were educated, They could write everything down. They could write everything down. And they were tenacious. They were persistent. Because again, they think they're doing God's work. This is a crusade. They're trying to save people, right? So it's possible they stay in the community for a year. And they might interview you once a week. If you're lying to them, eventually, your story will fall apart. Doesn't make sense. And the trick is to make sure that you separate one and three from two, four, five, six. Or if you understand, because during the Crusades, you didn't separate them. You killed everyone, which is problematic. Because a lot of Crusaders didn't want to kill Catholics. They only want to kill Cathars. And then the pope said, God will know his own. Let God decide who's a real Catholic. But that felt unjust and unnecessary. So this was a much more precise methodical way to figure out one in three, and then you burn them to stake. Just send a message to the community. Because what you really try and do is threaten everyone else to cooperate. And then eventually over time, people recognize that resistance is futile. But these people are so persistent they'll figure out the truth. And then they'll punish the Cathars. So there's really no point in resisting. And again, remember, this is really important. The Cathars own only a small minority of people in southern France. Before they were killing everyone in southern France, and this was uniting all southern France against the Catholic Church. Now because of the Inquisition they're able to be much more precise. Does that make sense, Eva? Okay, great. Yep, any more questions? Great question. Any more questions? Okay, yeah, okay. It's capability. All right, so in the Jewish religion, in Judaism, there's a ritual where the sins of the community will be put on a goat, okay? So basically all the sins of the community of that year, it will all be placed in a goat. And then they will let the goat run away, or they might sacrifice the goat, in order to cleanse the community of the sins. So the idea of scapegoating is to blame someone else for your troubles, or to divert people attention to something else that distracts them. So remember, in the idea of feudalism, The conflict is between a small nobility Right and a large peasantry the peasants often were enslaved by The nobility they were basically called serfs and as you can imagine People would get angry. Okay, they get frustrated and If they rebelled the nobility would have a problem. Okay. First of all There were a lot of peasants, so the nobility might get killed. But another problem is, this is your economy, right? This is your property. You don't want to burn on your own property, right? So the idea of scapegoating is this. You have Jews who work as middlemen. They're the tax collectors. They're the people who manage the land. They're the merchants. So what you would do is this. You would now and then let the peasants kill the Jews. And you think of this as a ritual sacrifice. Just as in Judaism, they would ritual sacrifice a scapegoat in order to cleanse the community of its sins, right? Well, you would allow a ritual sacrifice of certain Jews in order to cleanse the peasants of their anger. Does that make sense? Like I know this is hard, and I know this is disgusting and wrong, but it is a very powerful political tool. And so you will see the idea of skip-goading for out human history, right? So now that once the peasants have satisfied their anger on the Jews, they go back to work. Does that make sense, guys? All right. So, echo, is that clear? Okay, great, very question, okay. Any more questions? Okay, no, so in this religion, this world doesn't matter. What matters is once you die, okay? So everyone, while alive, is thinking like, how do I ensure a peaceful, happy afterlife? Okay? And the Catholic Church is what allows you to have a happy afterlife. Okay, but if you piss off the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church can tell you that nope, you're going to burn in hell. So the priority then is to be on good terms with the Catholic Church. And that's how you ensure eternal salvation. Yeah, it's a religion. It's a belief system, it's a worldview. Remember, religion is the culture, which is the worldview. And this is what people believe. So in China, people believe that if I get good grades in school, I'll go to good university and then I'll have a really good life. Right? That's a religion, that's a belief system. It's not necessarily true, but that's what people believe. And that's what drives your actions. That's why your parents make you study so hard. All right, good. Is that clear? Okay, good. Any more questions? Great questions, guys, but any more questions? Yeah, so I need you guys to really know this material because we will have to use this material in future classes. Okay, so next week we start the Renaissance. The Renaissance will take us to the Protestant Reformation."}

So today we do Islam. Some quick facts, some questions that we will look at today about the Islamic Golden Age. The first major question is, while Europe was in its dark ages, Islam was embarked on its golden age. So the first question is how did this happen? Why was there this divergence? The second question we're going to look at is, what ended the Islamic Golden Age? Why would this period come to an end? The third question we're going to look at is, eventually, how did Christian Europe overtake the Muslim world? So those are the three big questions we will look at in today's class. Some quick facts about Islam. It is the world's second largest religion. Christianity has two billion people. Islam has one billion people. They are divided into two major sects, the Shia, which is based primarily in Iran, and the Sunni, which is everywhere else. The light green are the Sunni people, and the dark green are the Shia people. And as you can see, Islam extends all across Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia, and into India. The most populous Muslim country in the world is actually Indonesia. The Shia and the Sunni, the only major difference is that the Shia believe that only a direct descendant of Muhammad's grandson Ali can be the leader of the religion, whereas the Sunni do not believe this. Now, this is a religion of one billion people, so there are many different belief systems, many different sects within this cosmology, but this is really the major difference between the Shia and the Sunni. So, Muslim means to submit yourself to God, to believe in God and to submit yourself wholeheartedly to him. And Islam was founded by a man named Muhammad who the Muslims considered the prophet of God, the final prophet. and Jesus was the penultimate prophet. And the legend is that at age 40, Muhammad, who is a merchant or a trader, he has a vision. He goes into a cave to meditate and the archangel Gabriel visits him and reveals to him certain visions that he has memorized. And these visions become the basis for the holy book of the Muslim tradition called the Korat. And Muhammad understands that his mission is to be a messenger of God and to reveal the truth of God to the pagan society in the Arabian world. So he's based in Mecca. And when he tries to reveal the truth, he is met with a lot of resistance. And eventually he's forced out of Mecca, and he goes to Medina. This is called the hijra in the Muslim tradition, the pilgrimage. And when he goes to Medina, he becomes the leader of the warring factions within Medina, primarily between the pagans, the Muslim tribes, and the Jewish tribes. So there are three major factions. And at this point, Muhammad Christensen called the Constitution of Medina, which promises religious freedom to everyone within the Muslim tradition. Okay? So ever since the beginning, and this is very important, the religion of Islam was an open, tolerant, and inclusive religion. And they basically maintained this tradition for the next thousand years. Okay? Eventually, Islam was spread from the Arabian desert to all across the Middle East. they will conquer the Persian Empire, and they will take at least half of the Byzantine Empire, including the richest parts of the Byzantine Empire, which are Syria and Egypt. They will also take Jerusalem, where they will build something called the al-Aqsaq, not mosque. And legend has it that Muhammad ascended to heaven from this place. Now what's really important to first remember about this place is the Al-Aqsat Mosque, it's still there in Jerusalem, and it is built on top of something called the Temple Mount. Remember in the year 70, the Romans burned down the second temple of the Jews, the holiest site in the Jewish faith. And now, and then the Muslims came and built the Al-Aqsat Mosque on top of the Temple Mount. Now, this is a very strange thing to do. If the Muslim tradition is open, inclusive, and tolerant, and Jews are welcome into the tradition, why would you build a mosque on top of the Jewish holy site? That doesn't really make any sense. And quite honestly, this has been a mystery to everyone. No one has been able to figure this out, okay? So we will today attempt to solve one of the great mysteries in the Islam tradition. Why was the al-Aqsa mosque built on top of the Jewish Temple Mount? As I mentioned, the Arabs will expand from the desert of Arabia, and they will conquer the Sassanian Persian Empire, and they will take at least half of the Byzantines. They will try to lay siege on Constantinople. But remember that when we discuss the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople is designed as an impenetrable fortress. So there'll be two major sieges. And because of the walls and because of Greek fire, they will be unable to take the city. The spread of Islam was lightning fast. In less than 100 years, they spread from the desert of Arabia, really the poorest place in this entire region, throughout most of the Middle East. So the dark green is where they started, and the light green is where they eventually expanded to. And remember, this process takes less than 100 years, which is remarkable. The Oman-Yak Caliphate was about 700. So let's just compare the Omanic Caliphate with other empires, including the Tang. The Tang really is the height of Chinese civilization. But as you can see, the Omanic Caliphate really is the largest empire in the world at this time. And eventually, they will also become the wealthiest empire at this time. There are five pillars of Islam. It is an extremely simple and clear religion when compared with Christianity and Judaism. There are five pillars to the religion. First of all, you have to believe that Allah, God, is the only God. And this mirrors the Christian and the Jewish faith. You are required to pray at least five times a day, facing the direction of Mecca. You must give money to the poor. You must fast during the holy days. And last thing is, you must make something called the Hajj, which is a pilgrimage to the holy site in Mecca and perform rituals in Mecca. This is something that all Muslims must do, and you will have the poorest Muslims. They will save their entire lives, just so that they could make this hash. The Muslim people are probably the most devout, the most religious people you will meet. They take their religion very, very seriously. This is the hash and Mecca. And I was actually in Saudi Arabia, and I tried to go there, and I was told, only Muslims can go. And so as a train station, I was trying to buy a ticket to Mecca, and they said, what's your Muslim name? like, well, I'm not Muslim. It's like, well, you can't go there. So I was disappointed. But it is a beautiful, absolutely one of the most beautiful rituals in the world today. OK, so to summarize the introduction, there are three major mysteries to the history of Islam that we still haven't really solved today. The first mystery is we know that they something called the Constitution Medina. We also know that Jews who are literate were part of the early movement of Islam. So why do we have no early records for the first 100 years? Well, for the first 100 years of the movement, that's very, very strange. Okay? Another strange question, another strange thing is why would the Muslims go to war against two major empires, the Romans and the Persians. That's kind of suicidal. They didn't know they were going to win. So why did they go to war? That's the first mystery we'll solve today. Second mystery is, remember I said that the Shi'a and the Sunni have a major sectarian divide. The Shi'a believe that only the descendants of Muhammad's grandson Ali can be the caliph, the leader of the Muslim people. The Sunnis don't. So why didn't Mohammed just named a successor and avoid civil wars that were erupt after his death. The third question is why was Al-Aqsa built on the site of the Temple Mount? And this is still a problem today because a lot of conflict in the Middle East is driven by this problem where the Jews want to rebuild the temple, but to do so they would have to destroy the al-Aqsaq mosque, which is a third holiest site in the Islam world. So this is a very important question that is still relevant to us today. So we will also look at these three mysteries. And again, no one knows the answers to any of these three questions, and no one will ever know because so much of the historical records has been lost to us. But I will try to provide you with an explanation, given my understanding of the Islamic world, which, by the way, is extremely limited. So please ask questions. Please challenge me. I'm looking at you, Doug. All right. All right. So today's topic is Islamic Golden Age. So let's just have a quick look at the Golden Age. At the height of Islamic influence, There are a few centers of incredible cultural creativity. One such site is Bokhar, Uzbekistan. It's still there, guys. You can get on a plane like Doug did and visit it. It is an incredible city. I say that, not actually having visited it, but I've heard terrific things from Doug. And you can go online as well and look at videos, but it is an incredible city. And it shows you the immense creativity, the artistic creativity of the Islamic Golden Age. But the main cultural center of the Islamic Golden Age is Baghdad, okay? It's not so beautiful now, but back then it was really the center of the world. It's a round city and it's a new city. This is a topographical map of the city. As you can see, it's surrounded by the Tigris and Euphrates, and it is a round city, okay? One of the few round cities of that time. Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, which started the Islamic golden age. The Abbasid Caliphate is the successor to the Umayyad Empire, okay? And this is where the Abbasid Caliphate was. And this is what Muslims considered the height of their civilization. The thing that's really important for us to understand about the Abbasid Empire is that not only were they influential in the Muslim world, but they eventually would come to create the world that we live in today. So we think of globalization, we think of this as a recent phenomenon. But look at the trade route that the Abbasid Caliphate would create over its three to four hundred year history. It connects the entire world. As I mentioned last semester, globalization has always existed to a certain extent in world history. But the Abbasids, the Muslim religion, would take these existing networks and make them a lot richer, a lot more dense, not faster. So you may not know this, but the Abbasids treat it heavily with the Tang and the Song dynasties. In fact, it is the Abbasids who would initiate something called the Maritime Silk Road. The Overland Silk Road has existed for a long time, but it is the Abbasids who will eventually create the Maritime Silk Road. and will bring China into the world to a greater extent than ever before. So this is the trade. The main center for cultural production in the Muslim world is something called the House of Wisdom. And its model is the Library of Alexandria. Remember last semester we discussed the Library of Alexandria in Egypt. And its mission was to be the first university to take all Hellenistic knowledge and culture and systemize it for dissemination. And the House of Wisdom was doing the same thing where it would take all knowledge and culture within the Islamic world and outside the Islamic world and systemized in the center of that center of it for mass dissemination. Okay, so the things that they were doing were they were taking Hindu numerals. Okay, so zero, one, two, three. We still use them today. They took them from India and again, they standardized it and disseminated this knowledge. They took works from Aristotle and Plato, translated into Arabic and Persian and then disseminated it. The main contribution of Islamic Golden Age to world culture is in actually mathematics. Okay, so they took all the math in the Greek world and in the Persian world and in the Hindu world and then they would systemize it and then build on top of it. This is a rendition of of the House of Wisdom. This is where the three major creative civilizations would meet and exchange ideas, right? The Greeks, the Jews, and the Persians. They would also take ideas from the Indian tradition and the Chinese tradition as well. The major literature or literary work that we still have today from the Islamic Golden Age is the Arabian Knights, okay? Scholars have looked at this very closely, and most scholars believe that these stories actually come from India. Also what's important for us to understand is that at that time this was translated, it was actually not that popular within the Muslim world. Poetry, philosophy, mathematics, science were considered the high arts. This was considered low arts. What we have today is that the Europeans would discover this centuries after the Islamic Golden Age and they fell in love with these stories and that's why we still have them today. And Disney movies are based on this as well. Okay, so let's look at some of the major thinkers and philosophers of the Islamic Golden Age. So at this time in world history, we don't differentiate between philosophers, poets, scientists, mathematicians. All intellectuals engage in all these different fields. So one of the most famous is Rumi, who is Persian, a poet, a mystic, a philosopher. Bin Sina is probably the most famous intellectual of the Islamic Golden Age. His books, his works were admired in Europe. Okay, so the Islamic philosophy was being exported to Europe where it would have a major influence on many of Europe's major thinkers. You may have heard a man named Leonardo Fibonacci. You should have heard of him in math class. Well, at this particular time in history, he was going to Baghdad to study from the leading mathematicians of this time and taking their ideas and importing them all back to Europe. So this is Ibn Sana. And the Latin name is Avinina. Ibn Rusa, Avaros, is also a major intellectual intellectual at this time. Just to show you how influential these two were in Europe, let's look at Dante's Divine Comedy. So Dante is in hell, and there in Limbo, he's meeting the most influential, the greatest philosophers in human history, who have influenced European civilization. Obviously, he's gonna name Socrates and Plato, okay? But guess what? He also names avarose and avachanti. So Dante is acknowledging the debt Europeans have to Islam. This is important for us because the Muslim intellectual influence on Europe has been whitewashed from history. This is something you do not learn in school usually. But without Islam, you can make the argument that Europe could not have modernized, okay? And later on I'll explain why that's the case. Omar Khayyan is also another famous intellectual poet philosopher. This man, Musa al-Hazami, is considered the father of modern-day algebra. His Latin name is Agorithmi, okay? And if this sounds familiar, it's because his name will give us the modern English word, algorithm. Both algebra and algorithm were originally Arabic words. So most of the math you're studying in school actually originated during the Islamic Golden Age. This name is Al-Hazan, and he invented physics, basically. Optics, again, extremely influential. And again, these ideas will be imported back to Europe, and they will become the basis of the Renaissance. Al-Zahari is the father of surgery. At this time in world history, the very best hospitals are in the Islamic world, by far. This is the first 24-hour hospital in Baghdad. What's also amazing about these hospitals is that if you were poor and could not pay, you could receive medical treatment for free. That was just part of the faith. All poor were treated with great charity and kindness during the Islamic Golden Age. This is Al-Qawwa, William. Again, guys, I don't speak Arabic. I'm probably butchering the name. But it was found in 859 in Beths, Morocco. This is important because this is actually the first degree-granting university in the whole world. It's still there, guys. This is the oldest university in the world. What's also amazing is it was founded by a woman who inherited a fortune from her father and she spent all her money on building this university. Morocco is an amazing country as well. Okay, so 1258, this time of golden age, officially came in N, or that's what scholars believe. And the reason why is on 1258, the Mongols will sack Baghdad and they will burn all the books. Okay? Or that's what the legend tells us. Baghdad had a thriving bookstore culture. And this was unique in the world. Intellectuals or the elite, they spent a lot of their resources on buying books. And they imported paper from China. They learned how to make paper from China. So books were extremely popular within Baghdad, especially among the elite. As well, because of the Koran, it was necessary for the elite to be literate. It was the mandate of you to be literate. And the Koran will also standardize Arabic and make it the official language of the entire Muslim world. But just because the Islamic going age ended does not mean that creative is stopped in the Muslim world. This has been called in, and he's considered the father of social science. Okay, economics, cognitive history, politics. This man invented a lot of these disciplines. He is most famous for his idea of Asabeya, which just means social cohesion. So he was actually the first to systematically think about grand history. Why do civilizations rise and why do they decline? And his conclusion is that the borderlands are able to conquer empires because the borderlands, the people there have Asabaya, which just means that they are more egalitarian, more free, more cohesive as a culture. Whereas the empire, because it's so big, it loses a lot of cohesion. And again, Ibn Khodan is a major inspiration for the history that I try as well. From 1300 to 1700, the world would be dominated by three major empires, the Ottomans, the Safayeds in Iran, and the Moguls in India. They are collectively known as the gun power empires. So what's amazing is, since its inception about 622, up until the 1700s, the Islamic religion dominated the world. And so the question for us is, why was that the case? How did Islam overtake Europe and overtake Christianity? Okay, that is a mystery and question for us today that we will look at. Okay, so let's go back to the three mysteries that I introduced earlier. Why do I have no written records? Even though we know that the people within the movement, Jews and Christians knew how to read and write. That's the first question. Second question is, why did Mohammed name a successor? The third question is, why was the Al-Qasr mosque built on top of the Temple Mount? Okay. So this is a paradox because Jews were an extremely important part of that early movement. So why would you offend the Jews like this? OK, to understand what happened, let's go back in time. And we know that in 622, Muhammad goes to Medina, and that's what starts the Islamic movement. But let's just go over to Jerusalem and figure out what's happening there. And once we do that, then we're able to figure out what's going on in that world. It turns out that in 622, there's a major war going on between the two major powers at this time, the Persians and the Byzantines. And it is a deadly war that is engulfing the entire Middle East. So this is from Wikipedia. Now guys, never trust Wikipedia as a historical source, but it's useful for us to understand what contemporary historians think, okay? So this is from Wikipedia. The Jews have aligned themselves with the Persians. Why? Because first of all, the Romans controlled Jerusalem and in the year 70, the Romans burned down their temple And in the year 135, the Romans expelled the Jews from Jerusalem, their holy city. So ever since then, the Jews obviously they want revenge, but they also want to return to their holy city and rebuild the temple. And with the Persians, they saw this as an opportunity because historically the Persian and the Jews have gone along very well. Okay? So the Jews helped the Persians take Jerusalem and push out the Byzantines. When that happens, the Christians in Jerusalem, they revolt and they force out the Jews. And then the Byzantines under the emperor Heraclius, they return Jerusalem in the first crusade. Okay? This is the beginning of the idea of crusade. and they retake the city. And then what they do is they expel the Jews from Jerusalem, obviously, but then they start to kill a lot of Jews. And they force these Jews outside of Jerusalem. So now these Jews have nowhere to go. But there's something called the Constitution of Medina in Arabia. There is a prophet, Muhammad, who is promising religious tolerance for all. All can practice their faith in peace. Right? So it makes sense for a lot of these Jews, not all of them, but a lot of them to join this early movement. What's important for us to understand is that at this point, Islam, Muslim, is not the state religion. Okay? All these people are called believers because Muhammad sees himself as the final messenger of God Okay Abraham was the first then yet Moses then you have Jesus and now Muhammad is the very last So all these three different Traditions the Christian tradition the Jewish tradition and this some tradition in the beginning. We're all just one religion, one idea, which is to bring God to earth and make everyone understand that God is the true God, okay, to create monotheism on earth. That's the origin of this new religion of Islam, okay, and this is the Constitution of Medina, which is in the Koran and which we know to be historically true. Maybe not the wording, okay, we know that this existed, and these people were called believers. And also this would also include people who believe in Zoroastrianism, okay, because Zoroastrianism was also a monotheistic religion. So the cultural Amidina was an attempt to unite all monotheistic religions into one single tradition that fought for God. Also what's really important for us to understand is not only is there all this persecution going on against Jews and against Christians and against Zoroastrians okay but also this is a apocalyptic state age where all three traditions believe this was literally the end of the world if you were Jewish you believe in a final battle called Argamanon between the Messiah who would lead you and against two enemies called Gok and Magok. Okay, guess what? The Persians and the Romans were fighting each other. So you could easily interpret this to mean the Persians and the Romans were the Gok and Magok enemy. In your tradition, this would be the final battle. This is when Jerusalem is most threatened. Well, the Romans, the Byzantines, just took your city and massaged your people. So in the Jewish tradition, this is the end of days. This is the final battle. And the Messiah would emerge to lead you to find a victory. That person, a lot of Jews, could interpret it to be Mohammed. Okay? So for the Jews, this is the end of days. But for Christians, okay, they also believe this is the end of days because there were a final battle between the Antichrist and the Messiah. Okay? The Antichrist is obviously Heracles, who is the emperor of the Byzantines, who We've been persecuting Christians for a long time. Remember, the official religion of the Byzantines is the Holy Trinity. But most Christians didn't believe in the Holy Trinity, and they were persecuted for the refusal to believe in the Holy Trinity. So for Christians, this is also the final battle. Zoroastrians believe in a final battle between good and evil. So this is an apocalyptic age where everyone believes This is it, the final battle. Muhammad is saying to everyone, guys, we're all one people, united by God. And we are here to fight for him. And this is very appealing for people. So the best evidence for my argument is actually the Koran. So again, we don't have any written records of Muhammad. But what we do believe is the Koran, It is a collection of many of Mohammed's original sayings that have been redacted over time. So let's look at some passages from the Quran to better understand how Mohammed was thinking and what he was preaching to the Christians, the Jews and the Zoroastrians. All right, all people of the book, by this he means both the Christians and the Jews. Why do you argue about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him. Were you not reasoned? Okay, so he's saying, why are we arguing about Scripture? Why are we arguing about belief? We all acknowledge that Abraham is our forefather. Okay? And Abraham came before the Bible, it came before the Old Testament and the New Testament. So what's the argument? Here you are, you argue about things you know, but what do you argue about things you do not know? Allah knows and you do not know. Abraham was neither a Jew nor Christian, but he was a monotheist, a Muslim. Okay? So this is what Muhammad is saying. A Muslim is someone who believes in God as the only true God, and that includes Jews and Christians. And he was not of the polytheists. Okay? Let's also look at Muhammad responding to the Christian tradition. In the Christian tradition, a lot of conflict arises from a debate over the nature of Jesus and its relationship with God. And what Muhammad is saying is, guys, the idea of Jesus makes no sense. Jesus cannot be God. Jesus at best can only be a messenger of God just like me. And the idea that Jesus is God makes no sense. Jesus was a human, just like me. God is God. He would not represent himself through a human. And so let's look at what he says. They disbelieve those who say, Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary. But the Messiah himself said, the Messiah is Jesus, right? O children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord, and your Lord. He's making a clear distinction. God is my God. I'm not God. I'm not His Son. He is God. Whoever associates others with Allah, Allah has forbidden Him paradise. And His dwelling is the fire. The wrongdoers have no saviors. All right? If you believe that Jesus is God, you are committing heresy against the true God. There can only be one God. There can't be two gods together. They disbelieve those who say, Allah is a third of three, but there is no deity except the one God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those among them who disbelieve. So what he's saying, this is very important, is that Muhammad is saying, the holy Trinity, The idea is just nonsense. They disbelieve those who say Allah is the third or three. Allah cannot be a fraction of anything. He is the one and only. Okay? Now, in our time, and we hear this, we don't really have emotional reaction, but place yourself back in their time. The year 622. Most Christians are being persecuted for refusing to accept the holy trinity as scripture. Because it makes no sense, we discussed this in class. And now, but if you say it makes no sense, you could be killed. You'll be persecuted for sure. And now, Muhammad is saying, you guys were right all along. You should have believed in yourself all along. You were right all along. So let's use analogy. Let's just say, for example, the world government. We have a world government. And for whatever reason, the world government tells us the sky is red. And you're like, wait a minute. I know blue and I know red. And the sky is blue. But if you say the sky is blue, you will be put in jail. You are not allowed to say the sky is blue. And then you have people, teachers, like me, telling you. The reason why you believe the sky is blue and not red is your eyes lie to you. You cannot trust yourself. You, your eyes are defective. That's the problem with human beings. We can't trust what we see, okay? And you have to go through life believing the sky is red even though you know in your heart it's blue. But then one day someone like a teacher says to you in class, actually guys, we've been lying to you all along, the sky is blue. Imagine your sense of relief and empowerment and liberation when someone of authority actually tells you what you've always believed, okay? That's what Muhammad is doing. Muhammad is confirming to everyone that what they believed, what they knew about God was right all along. Okay, so Muhammad's final message to the people is, God is God and only God, and he is everywhere and you can see him, you can touch him because he's everywhere. And as such, you can feel him and he can be inside of you. So this idea, well I should occupy most of the Quran. And this is what he says, with him are the keys of the unseen, none knows them except he, and he knows everything on that and in the sea. Not only false, but he knows it. And there is not a single grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there anything wet or dry, but is in the clear record. All right? God is everywhere. You can see and touch him in everything. Okay? And so in other words, what's happening is that Islam is really the first monotheistic religion in the modern sense. Okay? When you think of monotheism, we actually think of the Islamic version of monotheism. All right. So what's the power of Islam? And I want you guys to remember this. Islam is the power and beauty comes from how Islam is able to unite two major intellectual traditions in the world. The first is paganism, right? Remember the Vikings? The Vikings told stories. They acted out rituals. And therefore, there was an intimacy, concreteness, and interconnectedness to paganism that made us feel happy and good. It made us understand the world. It made us feel as though we could influence the world. That's the power of paganism. But Islam is doing the same thing by making God concrete. You can feel God. God is everywhere. He knows everything. But what Islam is also doing is, he's seeing the simplicity, clarity, and absoluteness of monotheism. Okay, monotheism is nice because with monotheism everyone becomes clear to you Right, okay. There's one God therefore. I set the follow him. I have to believe in him There's like a million gods in Panganism So it's unclear what you should do or how you should relate to this million gods But here in monotheism the relationship between God and you it's very very clear Okay, so in other words Islam is a major intellectual revolution in human history. And we have forgotten this because Islam, the idea has embedded itself into modernity itself. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so what I will show you over the course of this master is that Islam really is the plural of modernity. When we say that modernity began in Europe, we forget that Islam really built the basis for modernity. So fulfillment of the law and prophets. It's completing the story in the Bible. It's bringing God to the people. You can now touch God. You can now know God. That's the beginning of the idea of Protestantism, okay? And create heaven on earth. And this is the idea of science. Why do we use science to make the world better? Because God wants us to make the world better, all right? So a lot of the ideas that will underpin modernity, that God can be in us, and that God expects us to make the world better. It's already there in the beginnings of Islam. And that's why we will have this golden age, because they are propelled by their devoteness to the one true God. Is this clear to you guys? Any questions so far? Any questions so far? All right, so let me really quickly answer the three mysteries, okay? The first problem is, why would they know written records? The answer is, first of all, Islam marks a revolution. Okay? it is overturning the social order. The problem though is that eventually Islam will become the social order. So you obviously don't want to paint Mohammed as a revolutionary, okay? That's the first problem. Mohammed represented a revolution against the social order. All right, that's the first thing. Second thing is that we know that his early followers, the companions, were all wiped out. They're all dead. They all died. The official history says that they died in military conflicts. But here's the amazing thing about early Islam history. We don't have that much evidence of military conflict between the Arabs and the Persians and the Byzantines. We don't. There's maybe one city, Cecerra, where there was a siege. But we think that a lot of the conquest happened organically or maybe their enemies surrendered to them rather than fight them, okay? And that's why I would say it's a revolution. It's not a conquest, it's a revolution. Where ordinary people were so disgusted with the current leadership that they opted for a new belief system. Okay? The problem though is that once you amass power and it's a coalition, the question then is who's now in charge? So for the next 1500 years, there'll be a series of civil war to determine who will be in charge, okay? Those early companions were probably purged. The word we use is purged. They're wiped out. including the Jews and the Christians. We know for a fact that in the early days of Islam, Jews and Christians were part of a hierarchy. There's a man named Saint John of Damascus who was very famous and he was a lean official in the Umayyad Caliphate. We know that as a fact, but eventually they were purged from the system. And they're purged, what happens is they also purged history, okay? Because these are the companions of Muhammad, Christians and Jews, then they're legitimate. They're more legitimate than you are. So therefore, they have to purge that history. But knowing that, and the third thing is that, there'll be a series of continued civil wars among the Arabs in order to determine who will be the Caliph. And obviously, they want to disguise this history. They want to disguise this history of civil conflict. So the first 100 years, it was revolutionary. It was also very tumultuous and bloody. And that's why they had to disguise the first 100 years of Islamic history. Does that make sense? Get to you guys. And again, this is my explanation. I could be wrong. There could be other explanations. Yeah? Yeah? I think what you said, you guys, about that. Right. That is a great point. Thank you, Doug. So Doug's point is that the idea of history comes to us from the Greeks and the Romans, who wrote everything down, okay? But as Doug says, there are many cultures who do not believe, or they do not have institutions to write down history. We sort of take it for granted today, but back then, it was actually a pretty rare thing to actually want to write down your history, okay? So, and the good reason why is that, you write down the history, you're also constrained by the history, right? And that's why a lot of empires chose to not write down their history, okay? So thank you. All right. Second question is, why didn't Muhammad name his successor? Again, this is my theory. But if it's the end of days, if it's the end of the world, you don't need a name his successor, because God's coming. What's the point? In fact, if you name his successor, then you are a mini-defeat. What Muhammad is saying to everyone is that every of your traditions, Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, all right. It's the end of days. God is coming. There'll be peace on the world. Therefore, we will no longer need leaders. You won't need Muhammad. I'm the last prophet, man. So that's why I think he didn't name a successor. But there could be other explanations. Do you have another explanation? The third is, why did they build the Al-Aqsaq Mosque on the Temple Mount. And this explanation is going to be very controversial. So the Jews support the Persians in the war against the Byzantines on the condition that the Persians would allow them to return to Jerusalem, but also on the condition that the Jews would be allowed to rebuild their temple, which is exactly what Sars-of-the-Gray did. such a great is called the Messiah in the Bible. He's the only foreign leader called the Messiah in the Bible because such a great allowed them to rebuild the temple. Okay? So what I'm saying is this, our axiomos was originally the third temple. It is what the Arabs promised the Jews for the support. But over time, as these portraits happen, as civil conflicts happen, then the Arabs needed to consolidate their authority. So they turned the Third Temple into the Al-Aqsa mosque. That's what I think happened. If you go into the, I don't have time to go into the very detailed history of how the Al-Aqsa mosque was built, but it was a process that took about 200 years. And it's very possible during these 200 years, intentions changed. Okay? So again, I know this is extremely controversial statement, but I think that's what happened. Originally it was meant to be the third temple. But then over time, the Arab leaders changed their minds and thought to themselves that if we do this, then we make the Jews into very powerful political entity within the Muslim world. Okay? Does that make sense to you guys? Okay, again, these are my explanations. It's my interpretation. This is not historical fact. All right, now that we've done the three mysteries, let's go back to the three original questions. First question is, why did Islam enter its golden age and Christian Europe enter its dark age? Second question is, why did Islam make golden age? And third question is, how did Christian Europe overtake the Muslim world? Okay, to answer these three questions, all we have to do is compare and contrast these three major religions together. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There are both strings and witnesses to all religions. So let's very quickly compare and contrast these three major religions to see why they thrive in a certain historical context. So Judaism. The Bible, it's a wonderful piece of literature. It has a very rich history going back thousand years, right? So the Jews were the first to have a complete history of themselves. There are beautiful stories in the Bible that still inspire today. The stories of Adam and Eve, the stories of the patriarchs, the story of Moses. They still inspire us today and they inspire us to create great literature. And then you have a literary culture. So the Jews were expected to be people of the book. They were expected to be literate in order to practice their religion. And this helps us understand why Jews are so dominant in academia, universities, in the media and in culture and in the legal profession. Because these are people of the book. They have a tremendous respect for learning and for literacy. That said, there are certain problems with the tradition. The first is, it's contradictory. When you read the Bible, it's always contradicting itself. It's almost schizophrenic, you could say. It's very hard to pick out a definite message from the Bible, and that's why the old tradition called a Torah is actually much more important. And so Jews have to go to the synagogue all the time where the Rabbi will explain to them the meaning of the Bible because, like you read it by yourself, it's almost impossible to understand. The second problem is their God, yeah, he's very problematic. He's extremely problematic. As we know from last semester when we looked at the Bible, he doesn't seem to know what he's doing. And he's very, very violent. He often commands the Israelites to go kill all their enemies. So he's a very problematic God. And the third major problem in the tradition is faith versus history. If you believe that you are the chosen people, and you believe that Yahweh is only true God, then why are you being persecuted all the time? Why were the Romans able to kick you out of the Jerusalem and burn out your temple, which the house of God. Why are you homeless? Why do you lack a homeland? Okay? And this has been going on for thousands of years. And there are no easy explanations to any of these problems. Okay? So within the Jewish faith there's a lot of conflict and debate and doubt. So the Christian faith was created in many ways to try to resolve a lot of the issues within the Jewish tradition. The first The first major advantage of the Christian faith is it's the persimplication and perfection of divinity. Remember how we say that Yahweh is problematic? Well, now we have Jesus who we can understand. And Jesus made ultimate sacrifice, therefore we know him to be the ultimate good. Second advantage is, okay, now that there's a person we can for him deliver a consistent message of being kind, merciful, being loving. The third advantage is the idea of progress of history. Everything is leading to the return of Jesus, the second coming. So you may suffer now, but don't worry because Jesus is returning, and that will end history for us. So these are the advantages of Christianity. But when you do that, when you have Jesus, who is a God, you create a lot of issues. The first issue is it's a really confusing story. Why would God come down the earth, manifest himself as a human and then sacrifice himself? That's really, really confusing. I know there's a lot of really good explanations as to why this is the case. Still, if you're just a normal person, you can't understand the story. It makes no sense to you. Second is that it's kind of intuitive. A lot of the ideas in Christianity, it's just kind of intuitive. The Holy Trinity must be the strangest idea in religion where God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus are separate but equal. It makes no intuitive sense to anyone. And the third is, this is divinity. God is out there somewhere. You don't know where. You can't talk to him, you can't see him, you have no idea where he is. It's a very distant divinity. And so these are the disadvantages of Christianity. And so Islam now makes sense because it's trying to remedy and rectify these feelings of Christianity. The first is that it takes the Jewish tradition and the Christian tradition and makes it part of itself. So it is really the continuation and the perfection of the Jewish Christian tradition. Second is the abstinence of God, okay? This is now true monotheism where God is everywhere and you can see him. But if God is everywhere, then what's amazing is that you can now, that God can come inside you through your faith, through your devotion and through your practice, all right? And so what this means is you now know how to behave in the world. There's a clarity of purpose and action. You know that as long as you do those five things, those five pillars of Islam, your life will be good. God is in you and that gives you strength and purpose and power, okay? And these ideas is what will start this on a golden age and allow Islam to propel itself past everyone, okay? The problem though is it's too simple and clear. The advantage of being contradictory is you allow for different belief systems, which come into conflict with each other. And with this contradiction and conflict, it allows for innovation. That's why Catholicism eventually will eventually give way to Protestantism, okay? which is a reinterpretation of the Bible. But it's because the Bible show contradictory that this innovation is not to happen. The Bible was extremely clear. The Quran is extremely clear. But if that's the case, then you cannot allow for a radical rejection of the past and embrace of the future, okay? Second problem then is it's inflexible. It can't be as innovative as Christianity and Judaism. The third problem is Islam proports to stand outside of history. Judaism is to be inside of history. Christianity is inside of history as well. But Islam is eternal. When you read the Koran, it's meant to be the eternal words. These words are always true. But then the problem then is, how do you go about and interpret your actions through the lens of history. And how do you improve society based on this interpretation? So in the beginning, the very aspects, the very strengths of Islam will give rise to a tremendous period of creativity. But over time, you will have, these innovations will become dogma and they will ossify and they will prevent further growth in your society. All right? So does that make sense to you guys? All right, so let me reframe what I said in a different way, all right? So let's just compare, sorry. Let's, sorry. So I'm gonna compare contrast, Christianity with Islam. So, and then this will be a bit more clear to you. All right? But are there any questions before I continue? Is this clear to you guys? So I apologize, I'm making a lot of generalizations, but again, this is a macro view of history. All right, so let's look at Christianity and compare it with Islam. All right? So as I have said in previous classes, Christianity was developed by the Roman Empire in order to co-op first the Jews and eventually these barbarian invaders. And therefore, the religion is one of empire and power. It's really about how to control people. But Islam, as I just mentioned, it is a revolutionary religion that must be open and inclusive and tolerant in order to attract as many followers as possible. Now, the main mechanism of control for an empire is the idea of orthodoxy. Orthodoxy just means the correct thinking. But if you're orthodoxy, then you have the idea of heresy. Orthodoxy is with God, heresy is against God. If you agree that the sky is red, because I say the sky is red, then you are orthodox. But if you insist the sky is blue, then it is heretical. that constrains or limits the imagination. And the philosopher that you base your society on is Plato. So the idea of the bishop, the idea of the pope, it's really the idea of Plato's philosopher king. So I'll explain Plato's philosophy in a second. But let's look at Islam. So it's a revolutionary religion, And therefore, you must activate the energy of all your followers. You must get them to believe and you must get them to fight. Therefore, it's a religion based on intuition. God is with you. You know God. God is inside you. And the idea of intuition is what allows for science. You can discover the truth by just observing through empirical observation, through your own analysis, through your own belief. And the person who argues this is, of course, Aristotle. So this is the argument I'm making to you. A lot of scholars believe the Islamic Golden Age happened because the Islamic Golden, the Islams had books. They had wealth. But the Byzantines also had access to all these major thinkers, Plato and Aristotle. They all, Byzantines had a lot of wealth. What I'm arguing is that a culture needs to have a attitude, a perspective, a worldview, an orientation. For the Byzantines and the Europeans, they chose Plato. But the Muslims chose Aristotle. And that is the major difference. OK? So let's summarize Plato and Aristotle. How are the philosophies different? Okay, for Plato, the true God is called the form of the good. The form of the good is the beginning of everything. It is what is immutable. That cannot be changed. It is perfect and it's eternal. Eternal means it was always there and it will always be there. The form of the good, this God, he thinks and he emanates new concepts called ideals, like justice, reason, beauty, power, okay? And these ideals will manifest themselves into perfect forms, okay? Like a horse, like a perfect horse, a perfect woman, okay? This we can say is this heaven. We live in something called a shadow world, which is just an imitation of heaven. It's a bad imitation, so everything sucks, okay? So for example, if you fall down and you break your leg, it hurts because we live in a shadow world. So in this conception of the universe, what we're trying to do is return to the form of the good. And for Plato, he argues that you can do this through mathematics and geometry. Because mathematics is what is most like the form of the good. It is immutable, perfect, and eternal. So by studying mathematics and geometry, you are able to ascend back into the, from the good. But guess what? Augustine will take Plato and he will adapt it to the Christian faith, right? Because how do you leave this world by not sinning, by having faith? If you do that, then you are allowed to go to heaven, okay? So in the Platonic, Atlistine understanding, we in this world just, we all have to do is not make a mistake. So do nothing, okay? Do nothing and you'll be good. Aristotle has a different conception of the universe. He believes the formula of good is called a prime mover. All right? God is a prime mover. So God is the first thing that acts and moves things. And when he does that, when he creates motion, other things start to happen as well. So we're constantly moving about. What we're going is we are seeking truth. It's called telos. Telos means purpose. So each of us, our nature, has a purpose. If you're a soldier, your purpose is to be the best warrior. If you're a mathematician, your purpose is to be the best mathematician. And that is the idea of truth. To fulfill your purpose. And therefore, you must be constantly acting. Now the beauty of this idea of motion is you can now study it through empirical observation. You can observe things and start to understand their nature. And this gives rise to the idea of science. Okay? Right? So the Muslim world had a decidedly Aristotelian perspective, whereas the European world had a Platonic perspective. Now, the great thing about history, the great thing about civilization is that what will happen is the Europeans will learn from the Muslims. They'll copy the Muslims. They'll bring back Aristotle. They'll bring back science. And they'll bring back intuition. And they will do so through three major events. The first is the Renaissance, where they bring back Aristotle. The second is the Protestant Reformation, where they will bring back God. Remember the Catholic religion, God is a loof. God can only be understood through the pope or the priests. But the Protestant religion is, no, God is with us. God is in us. For your actions, you can win God's favor. And the last is science, the Santic Revolution. And these are the three major events that will give us modernity. But guess what? the Europeans are just emulating the Muslims. But, and this is really important, they will improve on the Muslims. Okay? So the problem with science is, yes, in the beginning you will have all the shamanist discovery, but this innovation will eventually lead to something called dogma. All right? And so what you need to do is create institutions to destroy dogma. And that's what the Europeans will do, which will, and this idea that dharma can be destroyed through discussion and debate and analysis, is what will become the basis of the Scythian Revolution, which will create the modern world that we live in today. So we will go through all of these three major movements in future classes. But please remember that it's the Islamic Golden Age, which will inspire the Europeans to do all three of these things, which in turn will create the modern world that we live in today. That's why I believe that Islamic Golden Age is really the polar modernity of human history. All right. That is my argument to you. Any questions? Anything you are unclear about? Was this clear? Okay. Sure. Sure. Okay. Sure. Right here. Right. in Central Asia, Islam moves into Central Asia, there's more contact with China and so on, and there's a real cultural analysis going on there, and Islam has to be very open to those cultures and be inspired by those cultures and engage with them in a pretty deep way. So in some ways it's not just the religion that's deciding factors, I don't think that the goal of the nation, but that this being able to draw on so many different conditions and rich traditions in a way that, say, that isn't the answer, or in Western Europe, you know, the Catholic stuff, that's the answer. Right, yeah, that's a great point. So let me elaborate on this point. So there's a literary critic, Norfolk Frye. Right, yep, Canadian, right? So Norfolk Frye is Canadian literary critic, okay? And one thing that he's obsessed about is how literature is developed. What he's observed is a certain moment in history when great literature comes about. And the moment is when a nation or a people or culture becomes an empire. And the idea here is, okay, with a nation you have tradition, you have cohesion. you have a certain literary basis. And then when it becomes an empire, it's forced to have a vista. It's forced to have a global perspective. And this change from a nation, a coherent people, into a cosmopolitan empire, at this stage in history, it's possible for them to produce great literature. And there are many examples of this. So the first example, of course, is Athens. Athens is the civilization of par excellence. And so when did Athens produce all its great literature? Well, it was basically the age of parathletes, which lasted from like 500 to about 400, maybe 350. But it was not that long. And this is important because this period is also when Athens, which was a very small polis, suddenly became an empire. And it was this transition that forced it to look outwards. So Athens is one example. But then of course you have King David and the Israelites. And again, after the Bronze Age collapsed, David was able to create an Israelite nation and then conquer a lot of this territory. So these people now were a small empire. They were a great empire. They were a small empire. And the last example that we have is England. Think of Shakespeare. When was Shakespeare writing? Around the year 1600. And that was when England, which for the longest time was this poor island, was now emerging as a global empire and with it a cosmopolitan perspective. So this is the pattern in history, which picks up on Doug's point where the new Islamic Empire, when they shifted their capital to Baghdad, they now became a global empire, and that's such that they absorb all these different traditions and cultures and become a multicultural universal empire. So Nournfrj has made this observation. It sounds convincing. I haven't done enough research to fully buy into this theory. But he has made this argument, and he has made these observations with these examples. So thanks for that. Any more questions? So next class, what we'll do is the Middle Kingdom, China. The reason why is at this station history, China is being brought into world history. And the reason why is the rise of the Mongols. So the next class will be on the Middle Kingdom, China, and after that we will do the Mongols. And after that we will return to Europe and do the crusades, then we'll do the Renaissance, the Bosnian Reformation, and the Islamic Revolution. Okay?"}

And it is incredible what Greek civilization is. It is the greatest, most creative, most significant civilization ever in human history. The Greeks really created Western civilization. And not only were the Greeks, the greatest civilization, there's really not been a second great general civilization. So let's think about how incredible the Greeks were. If you look at literature, the Greeks basically created literature with Homer. Homer wrote two books called the Iliad and the Odyssey. And he wrote these books about 3,000 years ago. Now, last year, I taught the great books to the students. And we read many books. And by far, their favorite book was The Elean. So think about this, how a Greek writer writing 3,000 years ago for a Greek audience, his book still resonates, still impresses, and still impresses students in China today. So that's Homer. Then you have Plato, philosophy, Plato. And even today, there are many who consider Plato the greatest philosopher who ever lived. There are many people who read the Republic by Plato, and they say it transforms their lives. It makes them think very differently about the world. Then you have in history a man named Facilities. If you are a military leader today, you read Facilities. There are still many generals today in America, in Russia, in Europe who believe reading Fusilii's will help them win wars. So not only the Greeks create civilization, but their works, their books are still widely read today and considered amazing. So now the question I have is, how did this happen? How were the Greeks able to create humanity's greatest civilization in really about 200 years? They really were not dominant for a long time. They really created all these works in about 200 years altogether. So how is this possible? OK, so let's go back to last class. We talked about the Bronze Age collapse, right? And we talked about how in about 1200 BCE, Greece was united in a place called Mycenaean Greece. So basically the Mycenaeans controlled Greece and Greece was a monarchy. And it was no different from any other place in the world. At this point, 1200 BCE, the world was basically the same. Okay? And then this society collapsed because of the branches collapsed. And three things happened, okay? First of all, centralization. The idea that you had a unified society, it went away, okay? So Greece became chaotic and decentralized. That's the first thing that happened. Second thing that happened is Greece became illiterate. So Greece, the Greeks lost ability to read and write. And we call this the Dark Ages. So from about 1,000 to about 600 BCE, but for 400 years, the Greeks basically lost ability to read and write. We call this the Dark Ages because we don't have any books or writing from that period. It's completely dark to us. So the second thing that happened, the Greeks became illiterate. The third thing that happened is the Greeks became poor. So before the Greeks traded with the world, it was very prosperous. And then because the Bronze Age collapsed, it started to become more isolated and became a lot poorer. So these are the three major consequences of the Bronze Age collapse in Greece. It became decentralized. It became illiterate. It became poor. And the amazing thing is it's because of these three things that Greece became the most creative civilization in the world. Okay? So remember this. It is because of the destruction of all Greece. It's because Greece became chaotic, illiterate, and poor that Greece eventually became the greatest civilization in the world. So let me explain how this happened. Okay. So there are three major reasons why Gwiksilacean became dominant. The first reason is the polis. The polis, it's hard for us to translate it. We usually translate it as city-state, a city-state. And this is where we get the word politics. But really, what it means is community. Community. And the idea of the polis is a community of people who discuss politics together, how to best run the town. And because of this chaos, there were thousands of policies around Greece of about 1,000 people each. So it's a very small community. And this became the main political structure of Greek society. So the polis is one factor. Second factor that happened is the alphabet. So after the Greeks became illiterate, they had to relearn literacy. They had to relearn how to read and write. In the process, they adopted a new writing system called the alphabet, which forever transformed the society. The last thing is Homer. Homer was a poet who introduced to the Greeks a new way of imagining the world. So these are the three major factors that led to the rise of bricksilization. And if you look at each factor, so the pole is what's a political revolution. It's forever transformed society. The alphabet was a language revolution. It forever transformed the way people communicated with each other. when Homer was really an intellectual revolution, if we ever transform how Greeks saw and imagined the world around them. So let's go over each of these revolutions one by one. So the polis. There were three things about the polis that allowed for innovation and creativity in Greece. The first thing of the polis was competition. These polises were all spread out and they were all competing against each other for resources. They were constantly at war with each other and that allowed for massive innovation. And again remember there's no centralized authority now. That's the first thing. Second thing is diversity. So if you look at a map of Greece. has very diverse geography, okay? It has farmland, that's mountains, that's plains, it has coastal land, okay? And depending on where you were geographically in Greece, you develop a different economy and culture and society based on the geography, okay? Does that make sense? And so you had a lot of diversity. And the last factor was the idea of democracy. So Greek civilization introduced the idea of democracy, or the modern sense of democracy to us. And the reason why is at this time, Greece was very poor. If you're very poor, you need everyone to participate and work hard, especially in battles against other polices. So the rule was, you could be rich or poor, but if you fought for us, you had the right to speak. Okay? You could be the leader of this polis and you have the right to speak, but if you, you could be the poorest person in this polis and you still had the right to speak because everyone had a responsibility to defend the polis. Okay? So this introduced the idea of democracy. And what this meant was that everyone basically had to participate politically. So you could be a farmer, but you still have to think about the political life. And you still had a responsibility to speak up in front of your peers. And this is where we get the idea of Polis from. And this was a major driver of innovation in Greece. So does this make sense, guys, the Polis? Any questions so far? Before I move on. Okay, so one of the major innovations of a Polish was the introduction of the alphabet into Greek society. So let me explain the development of writing systems over time to you, okay? And this can be a bit complicated. So make sure you're following along. If I'm seeing something unclear to you, make sure you interrupt and ask questions, okay? All right, so, when was first developed in Europe, in Western society in Egypt and in Samaria? And they did so to solve an economic problem, okay? So these societies were very wealthy and they needed people, farmers, to help them build roads and build irrigation networks and build temples, okay? To do so, I need to pay these workers, right? So writing system became a contract, right? A contract. So basically, the writing system, at first, was a pictogram, a pictograph that served the function of a contract. So for example, if I do this, OK, two people, OK? So what this is saying is, if you work for me, I promise to give two people two bushes of wheat. Okay? And so when you have this, you can then give it to me and I have to give you the wheat. Does that make sense? So it first started as pictograms. And then what they recognize is, hey, we can just have this as symbols, right? So maybe just two faces and then two Vs. And this could represent the same thing because everyone understood what it meant. So you went to symbolism. as a next step. But then what they recognize is, hey, these symbols can also represent ideas. So here's an example. So you have maybe a sun and a moon. Sun and moon, they can represent the sun and the moon. But if you put them together, sun and the moon, you get the concept of day. So now you have a concept, an idea, day. We call this an ideogram. And guess what, guys? Chinese is an ideogramic language. Does that make sense? And then as they continue developing writing, they recognize that you know what? It'll be a lot easier for us to communicate if these ideograms represented syllables and sounds instead. Okay? So rather than representing ideas, let's get them to represent sounds. So for example, this is sun, right? And this is moon. Well, now if we do this, it becomes moon sun, right? Which is English word for monsoon, which means storm. Okay? So now, This tells us to read it as monsoon. Okay? And then the final recognition is, guess what? We can actually just have the sound represent a consonant. Okay? The simplest sound. And this would be an M, this would be an S. So if I write something like this, it now becomes SM or SUM. Okay? All this, the alphabet, doesn't make sense. So this is the development of writing. And the reason why we do this is with each innovation, with each development, we're allowed more flexibility in our language to communicate our ideas. Doesn't make sense, guys. So now with the alphabet, something remarkable has happened. Before these different stages of writing required a professional class of people to manage the writing system. We call these scribes. The reason why is that writing is not speaking. Speaking is one language, but writing is a different language. This is true for Chinese, right? Well, it's true back then as well. So to learn to read and write, you had to have professional scribes to do so because it was such a complicated task. Does that make sense? But now with the alphabet, writing can become speaking. And this marked an incredible revolution in human thought and the capacity to think. So let me explain why. Before the invention of writing, we live in an oral culture. An oral culture, okay? An oral culture means we don't write, we just speak to each other. Alright? Now we live in a writing culture, a literary culture, where we don't actually speak to each other, we mainly just write to each other, okay? So mainly through email or text. texting. Now there are certain advantages to both cultures. With oral culture the first major advantage is it's very emotional. When I'm speaking to you I'm trying to get you excited. I'm trying to get you to pay attention. So I'm trying to think about how to rout your emotions. So it's oral culture it's very emotional focus. That's the first major advantage. Second major advantage is it's very innovative or an open. And what this means is I can create words when I speak, right? I can say, bukudak, OK? That means nothing, OK? But I can create it. And when we're speaking, you can figure out what I mean. So when I'm speaking, I can create all these different words. So there's room for innovation and imagination in our culture. Does that make sense? OK? The third thing is, the thing about oral culture is it forces everyone to have a really strong memory. The reason why is when I speak, I have to remember my speech, right? And then you have to remember my speech in order to respond to my speech. And this speech is going for like hours and hours. So back then during oral culture, everyone had a photographic memory. Okay, that doesn't make sense. So back then, they were a lot smarter than we are today. And it's the same as, remember, during the hunter-gatherer stage, right? When we're out in the field. Guess what, guys? They were a lot stronger, faster, and healthier than we are today. Because today, all we do is sit around. Right, does that make sense? So back then, they were a lot smarter than us. So these are the three major advantages of our culture. It's a very emotional language. It's very innovative and it forces you to have a really strong memory. Okay? But there's also a lot of advantages to writing culture as well that all culture doesn't have. So for example, the first major advantage is rather than emotional, it has to be logical. Right? It has to make sense by itself. I can't trick you with rhetoric. All right? I have to use reason and logic to persuade you because you can read it at your own time. Okay? advantage. Second major advantage is it's very disciplined. Okay meaning okay I can't make up words I have to use words we agree on okay. The third major advantage is even though it decreases my memory it stores up brain space for me to think deeply about the argument for me to reflect on your argument and find logical problems in the argument, okay? Does that make sense? All right, so we are basically before they were in oral culture and that had some advantages. Now we are in a literary culture and we've lost the oral culture, okay? But when the Greeks discovered the alphabet, what happened was they combined the advantages of both cultures, okay? They were, most of the time they were speaking, they were living in a rural culture, but they also had the opportunity to write down their thoughts, which allowed them the advantages of the liter culture, to have a more disciplined, focused, logical mind. Okay, does that make sense? And this marked an incredible revolution, the capacity for human beings to think. Okay, any questions so far? Okay, this is very complicated concept. I wanna make sure you're following along, okay? Any questions about what I just said before I move on? All right, now let's move on to Homer, okay? Homer. So we discussed the polis and how it is a new political structure which allows for freedom of democracy. We discussed the alphabet which marks a revolution in our capacity to think, okay? Now it comes on Homer. and Homer is a poet. Back then, there were many poets who went around and told stories about the world, okay? Legends, mythologies. And the very best poets are usually hired by kings, okay, rich people, because kings need poets to solve three problems, okay? Kings usually hire poets to solve three problems. The first problem is legitimate authority. What this means is, You have to answer the question if you're king, why are you king? Now we know that most kings get power by killing a lot of people, okay? That's how they become king, by fighting wars and by winning wars. So when they become king, they need to clean up their image, okay? They need to legitimize their authority. So what they tell people is usually what? What am I king? Why? Exactly. God chose me. And how do I prove God chose me? How do I prove that? Because there's a poet who sings a beautiful song about me. And this song can only come from divine inspiration, right? The poet is a vessel for divine messages, right? Doesn't make sense. This poem, this song is so beautiful, it must be divine. And if this divine song is saying, I am born of a God, the gods want me to become king, then I must be divine myself. Doesn't make sense, okay? So it's the first major function of poets in the society to legitimize authority. Second function is to create a cultural identity. So in China you have folks like San Guanyin, Romans of three kingdoms, you have the Bible. All these literary works, the function is to create a common cultural identity. It tells us what it means to be Chinese. Does that make sense? Because then you unify the people who then obey the king, who unifies them. That's the second function. The third function is the idea of cultural differentiation. To know who you are, you must also know who you are not. We're Chinese, so therefore we are not Japanese. We're not Korean. We're not American. Doesn't make sense. So most literary works that we have were sponsored by leaders, kings, to solve these three problems. So in the future we will read the Inaad, which is what the Romans had, we'll read the Bible. In China you have like the Romans of the Three Kingdom and all these literary works were designed to serve the powers that exist at that time. Does that make sense? The problem with Homer is when he was around, and we don't know actually when he was alive, about 800 to 600 BC, okay? Around then, we don't actually know, okay? But there was no king. There was no one to pay him. Therefore, he could only make his living by appealing to the people around him, okay? He had to appeal to ordinary people. And so the question then is, if you're a poet, how do you get ordinary people who are poor to pay you money. Why would they want to pay you to sing songs for them? Well, there are three reasons. The first is just entertainment. Today, we listen to songs, we go to movies. Well, back then, their entertainment, the source of entertainment was to pay people like Homer to sing songs to them. That was what they were thought was fun to do. that was their source of entertainment. Second reason is education. So remember that back then Greece was poor, they didn't have schools, but because of the polar system, they had to speak in front of their peers. So how did you learn to speak well? Well, you do so by imitating people who do speak well, who are usually poets, right? So when you listen to Homer speak and give speeches, you can imitate him and copy what he does to make your own speech in front of your peers. So the second reason is educational. Basically Homer was a teacher as well as a poet. Now the third reason and what made Homer special is what we call edification. Edification. Edification means to be a better you, to be a higher you. Okay. And edification, the way that Homer accomplished edification is by changing the way that you saw the world around you, the way you felt about the world, the way you imagine the world. Okay. So let me explain how he did so. But first of all, before, before I continue, are there any questions about this so far? Anything you are not clear about. Anything I've said that you are not clear about, or you're confused by before I continue. Okay, so Homer was a poet who told stories. And the most popular story at that time was something called the Trojan War. So the main story of the Trojan War is this, okay? So there was a Greek goddess named Nemesis. And Nemesis likes to create problems. She's always thinking of ways to get the gods to fight against each other. So one day she creates this apple. It's a golden apple. And the golden apple says, to the most beautiful goddess in the world. Okay? It doesn't say who, it just says, to the most beautiful goddess in the world. And then she just puts it on Mount Olympus for the gods to find. Three goddesses find this apple and they fight over it. Okay? is Hera, who is the queen god. Second god is Athena, who is the goddess of wisdom. The third goddess is Aphrodite, who is the goddess of love. They're fighting over this apple all the time and they're creating a huge ruckus. And so the king god, Zeus, gets tired of all their fighting and he finds a human stupid enough to be the judge. So this human, his name is Paris. His job is to pick who is the most beautiful goddess in the universe, okay? Is it gonna be Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite? And again, he's stupid enough to want to piss off two goddesses, right? So when he's making his decision, all the goddesses try to bribe Paris. Paris says to Paris, \"'Paris, if you pick me, I will give you your own kingdom. I will make you king of the world. Paris is like, oh, that's pretty good. Athena says to Paris, I will make you the wisest man in the world. I will give you all the knowledge of the world. And Paris is like, oh, that's pretty good. And then Aphelios says, hey, I will give you the most beautiful woman in the world to marry. And then Paris is like, I want that, okay? And so, the problem is, the most beautiful woman in the world is Helen, Queen of Sparta. She's a Greek who's married to a Greek king. Parasiteals Helen takes her back to Troy and then the Greeks get angry and they raise this huge army and for 10 years they attack Troy, which is a walled city, okay? And the war ends when a Greek general named Odysseus, he comes up with this idea called the wooden horse, okay? So the Greeks pretend they give up, They're going to go home because they're homesick. And as a president to the Trojans, they leave behind a wooden horse. The Trojans take the wooden horse into the city. At night, the Greeks jump out of the wooden horse, open the gates, and the Trojans are slaughtered. And this is the story of the Trojan War. And the Greeks love the story because it's really the Greeks being heroes. The Greeks have this great victory. People love to win battles. What's amazing about Homer's story, okay, it's called the Iliad, and we will read this next semester, that there are three things that Homer does in the Iliad. That's really never been done before, okay? And so, with the Iliad, we have the invention of literature. The first thing that Homer does is rather than telling a story from the Greek side, he tells a story from both the Greek and Trojan side. In fact, when you read the Iliad, you'll discover that the Trojans are actually more heroic, more courageous, and more brave than the Greeks. OK? That's pretty amazing. And by switching perspectives, a new idea comes into being that never really existed before. And we call this idea empathy. Okay, empathy, the ability to see the world from the perspective of other people. And before in human civilization, this didn't really exist before, okay? But homework creates this for the Iliad. The second thing that is new and unique to the Iliad is human psychology. So for the first time, homework discusses what motivates the characters in the Iliad. Why are you fighting this war? And so the story is between two individuals, Achilles and King Priam. So Achilles is the greatest warrior of the Greeks. Priam is the king of the Trojans. And they hate each other because they're enemies. Achilles is trying to kill Priam. Primarily trying to defend his family and his home. So the Iliad starts like this. Achilles, at the beginning, gets in a fight with Agamemnon, who is the king of the Greeks. They get in a fight, and they curse each other. And Achilles says, you're a dog, Agamemnon. I'm never going to fight for you again. And Agamemnon, the king, says, I don't need you, man. So Achilles refuses to fight. The problem is Achilles is the greatest warrior of the Greeks. And the Trojans led by Hector, who is a son of Priam, he sees an opportunity because Achilles refuses to fight. And Hector leads the Trojan army out of Troy, and they're destroying the Greeks. And the Trojans are about to crush the Greek army. So the Greek generals say to Agamemnon, could you please beg Achilles to return to the battlefield? And they go and talk to Achilles and Achilles basically says screw off. I'm not helping you guys. Okay his friend Petroclus okay, but chocolate is basically like his younger brother He feels sorry for the Greeks so he pretends to be Achilles and goes off to battle against Hector Hector kills Petroclus and this angers Achilles, okay? Achilles is so angry that he jumped into the battle and he kills Hector Once he kills Hector, he does something very odd. Usually when you kill someone's body, you return that body to your enemy for a ransom. Because the belief back then is only if you bury your dead can the dead find peace in the afterworld. But Achilles is so angry at Hector that he's torturing Hector's body, which is torturing prying. But even after Achilles does this, he can't sleep and he feels tremendous sadness, even though he's avenged the death of Patroclus. And the reason why is, in his heart, Achilles knows he was the one responsible for killing Patroclus, right? Because if he didn't get into the stupid fight with Agamemnon, and if he did not refuse the Greeks when they requested help, then Patroclus wouldn't of die. So it's because Achilles was so stubborn and so proud that his friend protocolists died. So he feels tremendous guilt for what happened and his guilt turns into an intense hatred for Hector. That's why he's torturing Hector's body. Then what happens is Priam, King Priam, who can't sleep either because his son is being tortured, okay? His son is dead but his soul is still being tortured by Achilles. He sneaks into Achilles' tent, okay? And he's right behind Achilles, while Achilles is talking to his generals. And at this point, remember, Achilles doesn't see him. He's standing behind Achilles. He can take his knife and stab Achilles in the neck, right? And that's what most people would do. But Prime doesn't do that. Prime instead kneels down and kisses the hand of Achilles, which forces Achilles to be an awe of this king who has knelt down before him. And he admires Prime's courage and love for his son so much that he feels tremendous shame and remorse for what he's done to Hector. And he returns Hector's body to Prime as compensation. And that's how the Iliad ends, okay? The main message of the Iliad is it's not war that creates civilization, it is love that creates civilization. It is prime love for Hector that gives him the courage to defeat Achilles in battle. And in this defeat, Achilles becomes a better person because he's able to forgive himself and is able to do what is right and just and return Hector to his father. Okay. That's the, that's the Iliad. As you can imagine, this is extremely complicated psychology. And it forces you to think deeply about who we are as humans. Okay. Does that make sense? And the third thing that is shocking about Iliad is the use of metaphors. So what are metaphors? Metaphors are connections between things that were unseen. So for example, if I say the sky is a snail, you're like, oh, I didn't know that. You understand? That's what a metaphor is. A metaphor is connecting two things that before were not connected. If you think about it, what this is is a new thought. And there are lots of metaphors in the Iliad. So essentially, metaphors teach you how to think. They are the tools for thought. So these are the three distinct characteristics of the Iliad that make it unique in the world. It's switching perspectives all the time which creates empathy. It talks about human psychology all the time which creates imagination. And it uses metaphors, which enables you to think much more deeply about the world. Okay? If you put these three things together, what this is ultimately is a theory of human. Okay? It's a theory of what it means to be a human being. Before we thought human beings fought over land. They fought over women, like Helen. Okay? They struggle for power. What Homer is saying is, what it means to be human is someone who has empathy, imagination, and the willingness to think. Only if you're willing to see, feel, and think, are you human? This is a new theory of human that becomes the basis for Greek civilization. And that's why the Greeks believe The founder of the civilization was not a general. He was not a king. He was a poet named Homer. OK? And it's because of the Iliad that they all read and memorized. And they could recite. OK? Because again, this is an oral culture where you're trained to have a very strong memory. And because they memorized the Iliad, it forever transformed them as humans. OK? This is a new theory of what it means to be human. And this becomes a basis for Greek civilization, which then becomes a basis for Western civilization. And it's because of these three reasons, the Polis, the alphabet, and Homer, that we have Western civilization as we know it today. Okay, any questions so far? Any questions so far, guys? All right, now I'm going to spend some time and discuss, okay, why is Greek civilization different from Chinese civilization? And this will help you better understand Western civilization. So the first question is, why is it the Greeks developed alphabet, okay, the alphabet, and the Chinese did not develop the alphabet? And the answer is this. The answer is, Greece was not an isolated culture. So the people who actually developed the alphabet were the Egyptians. And the reason why is, Egypt was constantly in contact and communication with many different societies and cultures, including the Samarians and the Greeks. And they could adopt new practices to advance their language. So it was the Greeks, it was the Egyptians who developed the alphabet. The Phoenicians were traders and the Phoenicians connected the Egyptian culture to everyone else, okay? So it's the Phoenicians who brought the alphabet to the Greeks who, because they became illiterate, were looking for a new language system. Okay, does that make sense? That's why that's how the Greeks got the alphabet. Again, the question is, Why didn't China develop the alphabet? And the answer is this. China, for most of its history, was isolated from the rest of the world. But not only was China isolated, but it was stable for most of its history because for most of China's history, China was run by a class of people called scholar officials, right? Confucian scholars. What was their power? What was the secret power? It was the ability to read and write. That's what differentiates them from everyone else, right? That's what made them indispensable to the emperor. That's why they were so powerful. And so when you have a monopoly over literacy, you don't want to give it up. You want to increase it. And the way they did so is by creating a new language called classical Chinese, literary Chinese. Does that make sense? That's why there was this divergence between Greece and China at this time. Because China, the pop, literacy was monopolized by an elite who benefited from this monopoly and therefore they made this monopoly much more effective by introducing a new language called classical Chinese. But only they could master. Okay, does that make sense guys? Should we? Because the skull officials, they were in charge of bureaucracy, right? If you're running a bureaucracy, you need the ability to read and write. you need ability to basically transport information from one place to the next, right? That's through reading and writing, through literacy. It doesn't make sense. So only they could become bureaucrats, okay? So, does it make sense? Okay, any more questions? Okay, second question is, why is it that Greeks had Homer and the Chinese, we Chinese, we never had Homer, okay? And again, the problem are these scholar officials. If you look at Confucian thought, there's a hierarchy in Confucian thought. At the very top are scholar officials. They're the most virtuous, they're the most well-educated, they're the most cultivated. They're the best people. Next to the, below the scholar officials are the farmers and the artisans, because they produce wealth for society. Below them are the merchants, right? And then at the very bottom are who? The artists, right? The poets. Now guess what guys? In Greece, this was the complete opposite. They placed Homer at the very top of the society. Everyone wanted to be a poet like Homer, okay? So when Plato was writing the Republic, he was trying to become Homer. He was trying to become a teacher of civilization, an inspirer of civilization, okay? A big god of civilization. That's what Plato wanted. But guess what? Facilities, when he wrote the Peloponnesian War, he was trying to do the same thing. He was trying to inspire civilization. He was trying to inspire new ideas because they all want to become Homer, okay? Because they all knew Homer was a father of civilization and they wanted to continue his legacy. And that's what made the Greeks unique in human history because only in this society put poets first and foremost at the top. And no other society did so. In China, it was the complete opposite because if you're a scholar official, what you're most afraid of is independent thinking. So censorship, censorship was their main role. Controlling how people thought through censorship. And that's why China never really produced a Homer or a great thinker. Doesn't make sense, right? And so this is going to be strange, but it's only because Greece got destroyed by the, at the end of the Bronze Age. It became decentralized, illiterate, and poor that they could then become a great civilization. It was only through destruction that they could have the Polis, the alphabet, and Homer. And that's the main message of human history. It's through destruction that we have innovation. And it's only through this process that human beings are able to rejuvenate their society. Okay, does that make sense? Any questions? Was this clear to you guys? Okay, so we'll continue in the Greeks, okay?"}

This is Professor Jiang again. I am in Toronto I'm still trying to recover from the jet lag and the time difference As everyone knows it seems this war in the Middle East is blowing up and It seems that even though the United States has yet to declare war on Iran Iran, it will probably happen in the next couple of days with the United States bombing Iran. So today I'm going to share with you my impressions, my analysis of what's happened in the Middle And I hope that this discussion will be clarifying, illuminating for many of you. So it's very clear what the US intention is, because we've seen what the United States has done to Iraq, Libya, and Syria. They call it regime change, but it's really the destruction of the society, the destruction of the capacity as a people to be a nation, to work collectively. And the most clear example, of course, is Iraq. In 2003, before the Americans invaded, it was a fairly well-functioning society. Yeah, I mean, there were sanctions that impoverished the people. But overall, I mean it was a fairly stable society in Middle East. The United States goes in over for Osama Hussein and at that time you had a lot of people who welcomed this transition and this change and they believe that the Americans were in the democracy, which was a stated mission, and it would lead to a more prosperous Iraq. But very soon afterwards, the Americans implement a policy called depacification, which is to remove anyone from the Baptist Party from government, from the military, from the police. And the problem with this is these are the elites of society. You remove the elite from society from the pillars of power, and society ceases to function properly. And that's exactly what happened. led to massive sectarian violence that continues even today in Iraq. So I can't believe that anyone is stupid to not know the consequences of this policy of depacification. And so when Americans say regime change in the Middle East, think of Iraq 2003 and what happened afterwards. So the question now is how will the Americans move forward? Well, the American strategy in the Middle East, it's been in place for the past 20 years. And regime change requires three pillars. The first pillar is the capitation of the leadership, just remove the entire leadership. is revolutionary intent. And you do that through economic sabotage, right? Through sanctions, by destroying infrastructure that allows people to live normal lives, which includes water supply and electricity. And the third pillar of the strategy is to foment sectarian violence, to divide and conquer the people, to take advantage of the fact that, Moving to the societies, there are these minorities of people who have traditionally been suppressed. You give them a promise of a better life. So in Iraq, you have the Kurds, but you also had the Shiites. Iran, there are tons and tons of minorities who are discontent with the way things are right now. So that's the American strategy moving forward. And if we want to clarify or simplify the strategy, we can use a metaphor, okay? Americans to win wars in the Middle East, they use bombs, they use propaganda, and they use money, okay? Bombs is basically, you have these fighter jets going in to destroy any military opposition. is CNN, BBC, New York Times to create the impression that this is being done in the name of democracy and prosperity and peace. And then money in that you are financing a lot of the opposition groups. You're financing a lot of the internal dissent, which will overthrow the regime. So this strategy, bombs, propaganda, money, it's also being implemented right now in Iran. In fact, you can be derogated that this has been going on secretly underground for many years now. Personally, I think the strategy won't work. First of all, bombs don't really work with the geography of Iran. You remember, Iran, it is a mountainous terrain. So it's a huge, huge country. It's three times the size of Iraq. So I'm not convinced that airstrikes will do any real lasting damage to the infrastructure of Iran. Propaganda, New York Times, CNN, BBC have actually no credibility today, not even among Western domestic audiences. They don't have even less credibility in Iran. And then you have money. And I don't know how effective money will be because at the end of the day, what differentiates Iran from, say, Libya, Syria, and Iraq is that people in Iran consider themselves Persians. In other words, they consider themselves here to a brilliant, creative civilization that's been around for 5,000 years. I can't overstate enough how that would energize and motivate the people to resist and to unite together. Also, what's really important is the Iranians saw exactly what happened to the Iraqis. once vibrant, harmonious, brilliant nation was destroyed by American sanctions and American airstrikes. So I don't think that the Americans have a compelling case to make before the Iranian people. So I know we've seen this is that even though it seems the Americans have the military advantage, they are still the greatest military in human history. The problem though is the Iranians have much more strategic flexibility. What I mean by that is the Americans to over-forest regime need to decapitate the leadership. They need to create internal dissent, a revolution, and they need to rally the religious minorities against the regime in Tehran. And that's really the main strategy moving forward, and really the only, oh, this is my son Chris, by the way, and that's the only real path to victory for the Americans. Whereas the Iranians have much more strategic flexibility. So in other words, American and its allies in the Middle East have major strategic vulnerabilities. For example, let's say Saudi Arabia. Well Saudi Arabia has two vulnerable resources that the Iranians at any time can strike at through the proxies, the Huffees. You have the salination plants, which is the only source of fresh water for Saudi Arabia. other Salamnation plants in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia loses all its fresh water in two weeks time and there's no way of replenishing that fresh water. Then of course you have the oil fields which are extremely vulnerable to rocket attacks. So Saudi Arabia, the main US ally of Arab nations in the Middle East, it's extremely vulnerable to Iranian attacks. Then you have the Strait of Homoos which controls a great deal of the world's trade. If we're going to close that off, then that cuts off not just oil to East Asia, but it cuts off revenue for American allies like Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar. And the last strategic vulnerability is you have all sorts of American bases throughout the Middle East, especially in Kuwait, especially in Saudi Arabia, Qatar. And these are legitimate military targets of America to clear war on Iran. So another way of saying this is Americans, their ability to inflict pain on Iran, we know it's predictable and we know that the Iranians can sustain it because this sanctions regime has been going on for the past few decades. the Iranians ability to inflict pain on American allies, as well as the American military, as well as American consumers, well, they're not really predictable. And ultimately, you can be the argument that because America is not that the American people are not in favor of this war, then it's very, it's less likely that American consumers will be able to sustain, absorb high oil prices and inflation that this war would inevitably cause. So, I would say the main advantage going into this war, just from a geopolitical and a political perspective, I would say it's very much in favor of the Iranians. This does not mean that the Americans in Israel will not be able to inflict tremendous damage on the nation. I mean if America and Israel continues its bombing campaign, which I suspect it will for the next few months, then we will see tremendous damage and economic loss within Iran. But ultimately, war is not decided by resources, weapons or technology. It's really decided by people's willingness to fight and die for what they believe in. And I think when it comes to this question, then I think the Iranians have a huge advantage over the Americans. Also let's not forget that the Iranians have been studying, sorry, sorry, sorry, the Americans have been studying the American strategy in Middle East for the past 20 years. I'm pretty sure they develop counter strategies against an American attack. And I think the main counter strategy is the idea of decentralization. You've got these different militias, different cells embedded in different parts of Iran. So even though America and Israel, they may be able to decapitate the leadership. They may be able to knock out the central leadership in Tehran. They won't be able to occupy the country. And unless they're able to occupy the country and install a military regime that's to the liking, then this war is not won. Then Iran is still a functioning threat to American Middle East interests. Okay, having gone through some broad analysis, let's look at questions that viewers have been asking on my Discord server. So the first big question is, will nuclear weapons be used in this war at any point? And my intuition tells me it won't be, okay, for many, many reasons. The first major reason is this is huge taboo against the use of nuclear weapons. If America were to detonate a nuke, America would lose all credibility, all authority among its allies and among the world. And we have to remember, like a lot, like this war is being fought to reestablish American credibility and authority in the world. Putin's invasion of Ukraine did a great deal of damage to Americans reputation. And fighting this war in Ukraine is to reestablish the idea that America is still the global hegemon, that it is still a unipolar world. And so by gaining a nuke, it shows the desperation, anxiety, and quite honestly incompetence of the American military. Okay, so I so for that reason, I don't think America will use nukes. Also, even though Putin has not publicly stated that he will retaliate if America will use a nuke against Iran, he hasn't done this publicly because it's not to his advantage to state to say that publicly. But I'm sure that through back channels, through intermediaries, Putin has has made this very clear to the Americans. And Putin will tolerate an American invasion of Iran, but he will not tolerate nuclear weapons being used in this war. So I think we can discount the use of nukes in this war. We would have to reach a very high point in the escalation ladder for even nukes to be considered in this war. So I think that for the purpose of analysis, let's discount the possibility of nukes. Second question is, what are unknowns going into this war? Okay, well, I think there are three big unknowns. The first big unknown is, what happens if the Americans kill the Supreme Leader of Iran? This would trigger a succession crisis. His son is supposed to take over in the case of the death of the Atola, but he's extremely unpopular and he's not that competent. So I'm not sure if the death of the Supreme Leader, the assassination of the Supreme Leader, what that would do to the dynamic of this war. But I would assume that this would be a huge advantage for the Americans and the Israelis. So I think that's a big question. Will they be able to assassinate the Supreme Leader? Okay, that's the first big question. Second big question is what will Putin's response be? And I think as we know Putin has withdrawn a lot of his Russian advisors from Iran and Putin has stayed pretty quiet in the matter. And so what he intends, what he will do, we just don't know right now. And I think that's the intention. I think Putin wants to be the power broker behind the scenes. And I think in many ways he's setting up a trap for America because there's really one scenario in which America loses this war, really badly. If America was sending ground troops, it would lose this war. And the reason why is the idea of sunk cost fallacy. So if America were to send in the Marines and a ground invasion, we can expect the American military would just bow those opposition. It would establish beach heads, it would establish foreign bases throughout the interior of Iran. And at this point, everyone's cheering on, like, look how great the American military is. There's a surge of patriotism in America, the American media, CNN, New York Times. they are just placing the American military to the sky. And it would seem a repeat of our version of the storm in 2003. The problem though is the American military does not have the death, the strategic death, the resources, the supply lines, in order to sustain this attack. And what happened very quickly is this massive blitzcrack, shock and awe, whatever you call it in Iran, we get bogged down really quickly. And at this point, it'd be very easy for the underground militias, these, um, these cell groups to strike at supply lines for the Americans. And it would become very quickly, almost in an almost an impossible, um, war to win for the, uh, uh, for the Americans. And, but at the same time, they've invested so much, and they're so close to Tehran, right? They're so close to taking over the capital, so they can't give up. It's some cost fallacy. And some cost fallacy is such a powerful force in geopolitics. And so the Americans are kind of stuck there. And then they're just forced to, it's like black hole for them. They're just forced to foreign resources that they don't have. And this might trigger, well this will definitely trigger protests across America, which may lead to a civil war. So remember, it's impossible for any nation in this world to defeat America. Just impossible. All right, even if the entire world were to get together and attack America, the world would still lose. The only way to defeat America is by causing a civil war, a revolution in America that would damage the regime so much that America would be forced to retreat from its obligations in the world. Okay, so my question then is, does Putin understand this? And he set up conditions in a way to create this outcome. And my thinking is, yes, Putin, this is Putin's plan moving forward and Putin will be working behind the scenes in order to create a situation where America is forced to invade Iran with ground forces. These ground forces will seem to be really quickly established supremacy in Iran, but they get bogged down. And then Trump, the Americans may be forced to have a draft and this will lead to Vietnam war protests and conflicts across America, America, which may in the end trigger an American civil war. So that's Putin and Russia. And but again, we don't know exactly what they will do, but if I'm right about Putin, then I think he will very much be the mass manipulator behind the scenes. The third great unknown is China. China and Iran have very strong economic ties. China gets a third to have its oil from Iran. If Iran were to fall and America would control the oil supply, then the Chinese economy would be in a lot of trouble. Deu politically, this be very, very bad for China. So China's a great unknown. What would China's response be? My prediction is we will not hear from China in this conflict that much. In fact, we can sort of discount China from this war. And there are reasons why, okay? The first major reason is China doesn't really have a grand geopolitical strategy. It doesn't really understand its place in the world. It's not a theory to explain its place in the world. So remember previously I discussed the Heartland thesis, the McKendor thesis, where both America and Britain need to stop a hegemon emerging to unite the Eurasian continent. Because if a land power would emerge, maybe Germany, maybe Russia were able to unite Europe and Asia together, then that would destroy America and Britain's capacity to control global trade. You're going to have railways connect Eurasia. And you really don't have to trade for the seas anymore. So that's how America and Britain seize the world. Russia understands that it is extremely vulnerable to invasions, it's been invaded by multiple nations in its history, which has caused tremendous death and destruction within Russia. So Russia needs to be unoffensive if it is to maintain its territorial integrity. Okay, but when we go to China, China really care about the rest of the world. For China, what's important is to maintain its territorial integrity by not participating in the world. China built the Great Wall. The purpose of the Great Wall was to prevent outsiders from coming to China, but also prevent insiders from leaving China. So for China, its main priority is to maintain its territorial integrity. And what it understands is the only way for the Communist Party to fall in China is if it were to engage itself in an external geopolitical conflict that there's no way of extrading itself from. That's why China is not going to get involved in this war in the Middle East. And at the end of the day, if the United States conquers Iran and forces China pay twice, three, four times as much for oil, then China will just absorb the cost. Because for China what's really important is to maintain the stability of the regime. The geopolitics doesn't really matter. So I would say these are the three big questions we're in for that we can watch out for. out for? Will the Americans be able to kill the Supreme Leader? Because that is definitely on the agenda and they're investing a lot of resources to ensure this possibility. And I'm not sure if it will happen, but if it does happen, then consequences for Iran will be quite there, okay? Another known is Russia, what Putin will do. I think it will be almost impossible to truly gauge his intentions and strategy moving forward. The last one known is China. China will participate in this conflict on the side of Iran. My guess, my prediction is, if there is participation, it will be much more, it will be very limited. So China will supply supplies, armaments, but it will not intervene on behalf of Iran to the degree that Iran would really want. So, one last thing I wanna talk about is some of you have been curious as to how I've been able to so accurately predict the contours of this war. And so the quick answer to this is I use a new analytical model called game theory. And game theory is something that I will discuss in greater detail over the next few months as I analyze this war even more. And game theory is not a secret. I mean, it's something that's impossible to learn. My hope as we move along is to teach everyone the ability to use game theory to analyze geopolitics in order to anticipate events and to prepare for events. So that's it for my first analysis of this war. I'm hoping to make more updates as this war progresses. And so there's lots of things I can't really talk about on YouTube because I'll be banned or I'll be censored. So as some of you know, I had a German video. I made a video on the history of Germany, and that's been banned in Germany by YouTube because it was flagged by certain users who found some material within the video extremely controversial. So I need to be really careful about what I say in order to avoid YouTube censorship. I'll probably at some point move to Rumble, will be more free to discuss what I really think about the world. So please watch out for that. I'll make an announcement if I move on to Rumble, okay? But the big announcement is, I set up a Discord server, as some of you know. This Discord server will allow us to engage as community. And what I'm hoping to do at some point is set up a time for where we can have question and answer where you can like ask me anything and I'll tell you how my thought process works and guide you through the process of developing a Game Theory mindset. So you can for yourself analyze global events using Game Theory. So the link to my Discord server called Predictive History, it's in the description. So please click on that and please join the server, the Discord server. And very quickly, we'll set up like an hour live stream where I'll answer some questions that you have posted on the Discord server. I apologize if I'm not responding to your messages. I have two young boys who are running around the park right now and have to watch them. And they're very active. And they're something from Jetlag. So I'm taking out on strolls to the parks every single day. So I'm usually not at home. I don't have internet access outside my parents' house. So I apologize about responding to you in real time to your queries and to your message. I am extremely thankful and grateful for the community that we're developing right now. And I hope to build on this community because as some of you have pointed out, the world is moving to a very dark place. And the only way to survive and to anticipate and to prepare for the chaos that this new world will bring about is to come together as community and to help each other out and to have solidarity. Okay, so please join the Discord server and I will see everyone on Discord. So goodbye."}

So let us summarize and review where we are so far in the story. So there are three major interests, forces that are pushing the United States towards war would be rat. The first is the Israel lobby. Remember that the Israel lobby is composed of both Jewish interests as well as Christian interests, right? Representing the Jewish interest is something called APAC. And they have a membership of about 100,000. But they're very wealthy. There are many billionaires in this group. So this group has financial power. In fact, APAC is considered the second most powerful lobbying organization in the United States. The first is the pensioners, okay? There's about 30 million of them. And their lobbying organization is the most powerful, but they pack it second. But also in the Israel lobby are the Christian Zionists, right? So for example, the organization Christians United for Israel has seven million people in its membership. So together the Christian Zionists and APEC are extremely powerful force in government and they want a war in the Middle East in order to advance Israel's interests. Also remember that America is now addicted to empire. This empire represents easy money. All money has to be channeled through the US. And so there are many people in the US who just make basically make their money by speculating on money, okay? So for example, Wall Street. And that has made Wall Street extremely powerful right now in US politics. And the third force is Saudi Arabia. Remember that in our discussion of Saudi Arabia, we learned that the major conflict in the Middle East is actually not between Israel and Iran, but between Saudi Arabia and Iran. For Israel, Iran is a security threat because it supports Hezbollah and Hamas. But for Saudi Arabia, Iran represents a threat to its very existence. So Saudi Arabia must resolve the Iran problem soon. Now, how these three forces manifest themselves is through Trump, okay? So basically Trump is your champion. And privately, there's a man named Jared Kushner who is Trump's son-in-law. He's married to Trump's third daughter, Ivanka Trump. And Jared Kushner happens to be very good friends with both Benjamin Netanyahu, who is the leader of Israel, as well as Mohammed bin Salman, who is the leader of Saudi Arabia. Now Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, was a very prominent sponsor of APEC. In fact, when Benjamin Netanyahu comes to stay in the United States, he lives with the Kushner family. So one night, Benjamin Netanyahu had to stay in Jerk Kushner's bedroom, and Jerk Kushner had to sleep in the basement. Okay, that's how close they are. And Jerk Kushner is friendly with MBS, the leader of Saudi Arabia, so friendly that when Jared Kushner started a private equity fund, started to be invested $2 billion. So for Jared Kushner, these three forces are able to exert influence on Trump. As we also discussed, it's very likely that Trump will become president of the United States again in November. And he will pick Nikki Haley as his VP. And that means that Nikki Haley will be the one in the Trump White House pushing for war against Iran. As we discussed, Nikki Haley makes most of her money from the Israel lobby, the anti-Iran lobby. We know from the first Trump administration that these forces are able to exert tremendous influence on Trump. And the evidence is, one, Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal that would have secured peace between the United States and Iran. Trump moved the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel, which caused major friction in the Middle East. We also know that Trump ignored the fact that MBS killed a journalist. So we also know that Trump has been very friendly with Saudi Arabia. We also know that Trump spawned through the Abraham Accords, which is trying to bring peace between Israel and other Arab countries and unite them against Iran. The last thing that Trump did, which is the most important, is that in January 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of General Qassam Salamani, who is the leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. So from all this, we can suspect that in a second Trump term, war with Iran will be a major priority. So is this clear so far? All right, now we also discussed that, okay, even though there are these forces that want war with Iran, ultimately it is the US military that must implement this war. And if the US military refuses to go to war, then the war can't happen. So we discussed that unfortunately the US military is very different from what it was 30 years ago. 30 years ago, the US military maintained very standard military doctrine. They maintained three very important principles that all militaries must maintain in a time of war. The first is mass forces. B is avoid encirclement, right? And the third is protect supply lines. Now, the important idea is that when you fight a war like this, okay, which is traditional warfare, you must have the consent of the public, okay? Because it is the public that sends soldiers that provides money, that gives you political support. But in 2003, the US military changed its military doctrine to one of Chakranaw. And what Chakranaw means is that you don't have to follow these three principles anymore. You can use air supremacy. You also have technological omniscience and you also have special forces. And this allows you to fight wars cheaply, quickly, and decisively so that you no longer need public, political support for fighting wars. And as we also discussed, this created the idea of hubris in the American military. So the American military, because of the 2003 war in Iraq, are causing, I can win any war, any place against any enemy. We know that the doctrine is actually not true. And we know because of something called Operation Prosperity Guardian. So a few months ago, the Houthis, which are a rebel group in Yemen, They started to attack ships in the Red Sea, okay? And a lot of trade goes through the Red Sea. So the American military dispatched a massive naval force against the Houthis. Were the Americans able to defeat the Houthis? No, they were not. And so what are the Americans gonna do about it? What can they do about the Houthis? What's the solution to this problem? up these pirates, the Houthis, going around and attacking these ships, which is affecting international commerce. And that's why inflation is such a huge problem right now in the world. So what's American military going to do about this? What can they do about this? The answer is nothing. The American military has no solution. Why? Because they don't have the forces necessary in order to undertake an operation against the Houthis. They have special forces, they have air supremacy, they have technological omniscience, satellites, but they don't have infantry, they don't have lots and lots of ships. Therefore they cannot stop the Houthis. Okay? And what's really important is that Joe Biden has come out and said that, yes, we know we are losing the war in the Red Sea, and yes, we know that we cannot stop the Houthis, we are going to continue on this path. Okay, does that make sense? This idea of hubris, not knowing your limitations. And when you are faced with your limitations, you refuse to accept your limitations. Okay, and that's why when the US military is given the order to invade Iran, they'll probably go along with it because they cannot imagine the possibility that they could be defeated in Iraq. Okay? And then you have the Iran Revolutionary Corps, okay? The Revolutionary Guard. And as we discussed last class, they want war with the United States, because they're very angry about U.S. interference in Iran, right? So during the Shah regime, which was a brutal police state from 1953 and then 1979, the Americans were the ones who were backing this police state. So there are many who are who are angry about this. They're also angry about the fact that the US continues to protect Israel and Saudi Arabia. They're also angry about the fact that Trump killed General Salamani. And as we discussed, it's possible that the revolutionary guard corps killed last week the president of Iran, Ibrahim Rehzi, because he was preventing war. So they want war with the United States. So you see the map, right? You see the logic of this, where there are powerful forces in the United States pushing United States towards war. You have Trump who has basically agreed in his first term to raise or increase escalation with Iran. Within the Trump White House, there will be Derek Kushner and Nikki Haley to push this war both privately and publicly. There is military, has so much hubris that they think they can win this war, and Iran wants to provoke the United States into invading it. Okay, in Iran can have many, so Iran has many, many strategies in order to provoke the United States into war. Okay, basically the United States is looking for a reason and Iran wants to give them a reason. And that's why I think war between the United States and Iran is very likely in the next two to four years. Okay, any questions so far? or we clear about where we are so far before I move on. Any questions? Okay, so now let's talk about the actual war. So here, most of this is speculation, okay? But I'm using speculation in order to help us better understand what a war would look like, okay? So let's pretend that it's March 2027, okay? Okay, and Trump goes on TV. He announces Operation Iranian Freedom, a full-scale US invasion of Iran, along with Israel, Saudi Arabia as its main partners, but the United Kingdom, UK will be involved, Australia will be involved, UAE will be involved, Poland will be involved. Okay, so you have many countries attacking Iran together. And Trump goes on TV and explains to American public why the United States is fighting this war. Okay, and this is what Trump says. First he says that for the past year, there have been violent protests in Iran. You have religious protests. You have political protests. You have ethnic protests. The Iranian people are sick of the Ayatollah. They are sick of the dictatorship. They want democracy. They want freedom. And in response, the Russian guard are killing thousands of protesters. Iran is on the brink of civil war. Therefore, the United States has an obligation to protect the people of Iran. The people of Iran are praying for freedom and democracy. And the United States, the world's greatest democracy, must give them democracy. Okay, so the first reason is freedom and democracy. Second, US intelligence, along with Israeli intelligence, have discovered that for the past two years, Iran has been working very, very hard on developing a nuclear bomb. In fact, Iran is only one month away from having three nuclear bombs so that New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles could all be destroyed. So to prevent this, we must strike first to stop Iran's nuclear program. Third, Iranian proxies, the Houthis, Hezbollah, many groups have been disrupting shipping in the Middle East, in both the Red Sea and the Shored Homoos. 40% of the world's oil passes through that region, mainly to East Asia, China, Japan, South Korea. Our global prosperity is at stake. We must go to war to protect these shipping lanes and ensure that the oil goes to China, Japan, and South Korea so that they can continue their economic prosperity. So the United States, as the world hegemon, has a responsibility to protect global prosperity. Four, Iran has been launching attacks against our allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Hezbollah has been violently attacking Israel, killing dozens of Israelis, innocent Israelis. The Houthis have been attacking Saudi Arabia oil fields, damaging the economy. We have an obligation to protect our allies, our friends in Middle East, okay? And the last reason is we know for a fact that the Iranian revolutionary Garkor is a sponsor of terrorism. Last week in a mall, there were gunmen who went and killed 107 people. Our intelligence says that it was most definitely an Iranian operation. Okay. So for these five reasons, we have decided to invade Iran, but don't worry. This invasion will be successful because we have a lot of allies. The UK, Israel, Saudi Arabia, all our friends, we're part of this operation. Our special forces are already in the country looking for their air bases and their missiles. We can knock them out at beginning of the war. Also we have been in contact with Iranian opposition groups. They want to overthrow the regime and when we help them they will install democracy in the country. Our American military is the greatest in the world. In 1991, our military defeated Saddam Hussein in 100 hours. In 2003, our military defeated Saddam Hussein in less than three weeks. To prove that we are the greatest in the world, we will defeat Iran in only two weeks. So do not worry. We will be strong in protecting democracy, freedom, and global prosperity. Okay? So that's what Donald Trump will say to the people of the United States, okay? And of course, you're going to have large-scale protests throughout the country opposing this war, but most people in the country will support this war. Okay? All right. So at this speech, the operation is launched. And on TV, we'll watch this on TV on YouTube together, okay? And we'll be so impressed by the power of the US military. This is Iran. This is the Strait of Homs. Saudi Arabia. Israel is here. Red Sea is here. Iraq is here. So in the Shrek of Homoos comes the USS Gerald R Ford. It's a $13 billion supercarrier. This thing is designed to destroy countries. It is now prowling the Shrek of Homoos to ensure that shipping is safe. America establishes air supremacy very quickly, meaning it has complete control over the skies. Nothing can move in the skies without America detection. And then a massive invasion force is sent to Iran in the south. 100,000 US troops land, maybe 200,000 Saudi Arabian troops land. Maybe you have 200,000 to half a million troops in Iran. And they are about to strike Tehran in the north. So in the south, the United States and its allies have established a foothold. They have a huge presence in the country, and they're about to attack Tehran. All right, you understand what has happened? All right, now I want to ask you this question. At this point, I think the war has been decided. Who has won the war? America has established air supremacy. It controls the skies. US Navy controls the seas. You have 100,000 US troops in country where the district is to run. The war hasn't decided. Who has won the war? Okay, obviously this is a trick question. Obviously Iran has won the war. Why? Why? What's the problem with this plan? Okay, this is typical American doctrine, shock and awe. This is how they fight wars. But there's a problem with this plan. What is it? Why would the Iranians want this? Okay, let's go back to traditional military doctrine. In traditional military doctrine, you have three principles, right? Mass forces, avoid encirclement, protect supply lines. These are three things you must absolutely obey if you're in a winter war, okay? So using traditional military doctrine, explain to me why the United States has lost the war right now. Exactly, first of all, they're encirclement. You know why? Because Iran are all mountains. It's a fortress, meaning that to get these troops into the country, you have to airdrop them. But guys, once you're in the country, you can't get them out of the country. You understand? So that's the first problem. They've been in circle. What's the second problem? Why not? That's right. And why else? Yeah, that's right. So they failed to mass forces. Iran is a population of 90 million people. You will need at least three to four million soldiers. You didn't think about conquering the country. They've got 100,000 in this country. And as Jack says, you can't move tanks for mountains. They're not designed for mountain warfare. What are you going to do? So they can't mass forces. And they've been circled. And what else is the problem? And this is the biggest problem. Exactly, they cannot be resupplied, okay? They have no supply lines. For them to be resupplied, airplanes have to drop ammunition, food, into the country. But again, Iran is all mountains. So it's very easy for Iranians to shoot down the airplanes. Does that make sense? When you pass through mountains, you can't see what's on the ground. A random guy with a rocket launcher can just shoot down the helicopter, okay? Which is what the Afghans did against the Soviets in the Afghanistan War. And that's why the Soviets lost the war. A drone can take down any airplanes, okay? So in other words, these guys are trapped. They're U-Finder soldiers, but they're not. What they really are hostages, okay? Does that make sense? You have too many people in the country so you can't get them out of the country, but you don't have enough people to actually launch a strike against Iraq. You can't resupply them. and they've been encircled by Iranian forces. All right, does that make sense? Okay, okay. Now, the logic of having 100,000 US troops in the country is that once in the country, all the resistance to the regime will rise up and strike against Iran. The Iranian army will mutiny against the country. Okay, that's the whole. Why do we think this won't happen? Why won't the Iranians revolt against their government? Why don't they want to revolt? That's right. So Iranians hate Americans. Remember that Iranians remember the Shah. From 1953 until 1979, the Shah, the American-supported Shah, was running a brutal police state. So brutal that everyone in Iran revolted against the regime. That's number one. Why else would the Iranians not support the Americans? Why? That's the first reason. Iran has a bad history of America. Why else? Guys, which country is next door? What happened in Iraq? America destroyed Iraq, right? From 2003 into 2011, America was there destroying the country. America said that it would bring freedom democracy. It would bring prosperity. It would bring wealth. But instead, it just destroyed the country. American soldiers were running into houses every night, pointing guns at children, destroying homes, and arresting men for no reason. Okay? Iranians saw all this on TV. They heard about all this from neighbors. Okay? So they know that if America comes, it's destroy the country, not to bring freedom of democracy, not to bring prosperity, it's to destroy the country. That's why they're gonna fight. Okay? And another reason is that Iranians think that they belong to a great civilization. So they value their freedom and independence. Okay, does that make sense? They're not going to submit to a foreign conqueror. So why else would the Iranians resist? Also religion, right? The Iranians are religious. They believe that America is Satan, and they have a duty, a religious obligation, to fight Satan. So for many reasons, there's just no way that the Iranian people are going to stand with America. You might have a minority, but most are going to resist. So does that make sense? Any questions so far? So that's a great question. Why would the Americans think that the Iranian people will rise up. And the answer is that the nation justifies the invasion. Does that make sense? They have to have a logical explanation for why this invasion will succeed. Because one of the criticisms against them will be like, you need four million people to invade Iran. They don't have four million soldiers. They have at most one million soldiers, okay? Total throughout the world. They have about 60,000 in the Middle East. So they can't get a million soldiers. So the only explanation is, okay, well we're gonna pretend that once we invade, the people we ran will support us. You understand? So it's not based on true, but it's an explanation for why the invasion will succeed. Does that make sense? Oh, you know, that's a great question, okay. So that's their propaganda, but do they actually believe this? And the answer is, hubris, okay? They do believe this, because they have hubris. And again, it's hard because we're not in a position. But once you're in a position where you have access to nuclear weapons, when you can kill anyone in the world, when you can see everything in the world, it makes you think you're God. Okay? And remember like last semester we were reading the Greeks. And the Greeks believe the worst thing is hubris. Because it makes you think you're God. But you're not God. You're gonna get into a lot of trouble if you think you're God, okay? Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Any more questions? Okay. So, um, Trump says that Iran is one month from developing a nuclear bomb, right? America has been seeing this for the past 10 years. Okay. You just Google this and America is like, oh, Iran is only one month away from a nuclear bomb. They've been seeing this for the past 10 years. So do you understand? When Trump gives a speech, there's absolutely no evidence that any of this is true. But this is how you explain the invasion. All right? And chances are that even if Tehran possess a nuclear bomb, they won't use it. Why not? That's right. The reality is that there's only one way that America can win this war against Iran. They can just nuke the country. And America will do that if it has enough, if it has a pretext. So nuclear weapons is something that Iran is very afraid of. So does it make sense? All right. So this becomes so American soldiers are trapped in this country. So now the question then is, wait a minute here. Why would America do something so stupid as send 100,000 soldiers into the country for no reason and get them trapped? So that's a question. And what I want to do now is make you the argument that there are two ways that we can prove or provide evidence that this is true. The first is historical analysis. Historical analysis means that are there historical examples like this? Are there historical analogs? If there are, then this could be true. The second method is to gain theory analysis. Why would the actors who are rational do something as stupid as trap 100,000 American soldiers in Iran? All right, so we'll first do historical analysis to find historical analogs, examples, similar to this. And then we'll look at game theory to try to reason out the motivation of the actors. Okay, so let's first look at game theory. Oh, sorry, sorry. Let's first look at historical analysis. Okay, so the year is 415 B.C. okay? In Athens. Remember that we studied facilities, the Peloponnesian War last semester, okay? So we will now discuss the Peloponnesian War. The war is, the year is 415 B.C. And for the past 17 years, Athens have been fighting a brutal war against Sparta. It's a stalemate. And then for whatever reason, a man named Alcabaites, has a suggestion. And his suggestion is, to win the war against Sparta, let's go invade Sicily. And Nesias, his opponent, is like, why the hell would we want to invade Sicily? It's far away. And alphabet by this is like, well, because it has a lot of money. And if we invade the country, we can take their money. And it turned out by making this argument, the people of Athens really support this argument. Because the reason why is war was costing them a lot of money. And they become addicted to the easy money of empire. So they want to fight this war. So Nisius has this great idea of how to convince people not to go to war. And what he says to the people is, okay guys, I know you wanna fight this war. I know you wanna, I know that you think this war is a good idea, but Sicily is a huge place. It has a navy. Therefore, we need a massive expedition force against Syracuse and Sicily, okay? We need at least 5,000 soldiers. That's a lot, okay? Because the total Athenian population is about 50,000 people, okay? 5,000 soldiers is a lot for Athens. And we need about 100 ships. And the idea is, Nisses is trying to scare people into agreeing to not fight. That's the idea. The Athenians say, that's a great idea. Let's send a massive force against Sicily and Syracuse so the war can be won just like that, shock and all. So the problem though is that never before in his history has Athens sent a large expedition force against another power, okay? Does that make sense? When the Persians invaded, they were invading Athens. Athens didn't go invade Persia. So when you have sent a massive expedition force against another country, what is your number one problem? What is the thing that you must resolve? But the Athenians didn't really think about it because they had no experience in fighting a foreign war. So yeah, the enemy knows the terrain better than you do. But there's actually a much bigger problem than that. And it is what? Okay, the biggest problem is resupply. And this is something that the Athenians didn't think about because they never thought, they never fought a war like this before. So they sent this huge expedition against Sicily And Syracuse, which was a naval power, were surprised because they were like, why would the Athenians want to invade us? So for the first year, the Athenians were destroying the Syracuse army. And the Syracuse army had to retreat back into their city. And so the Athenians laid siege to the city. The Athenians, Syracuse is here. The Athenians are here. And the Athenians control the sea, right? So this situation is very similar to this situation. Do you understand? But then what happened was that the Athenians couldn't resupply themselves. And the reason why is Syracuse had also had a navy and they could stop the Athenian navy from resupplying the Athenian troops. And therefore, the Athenian army was wiped out in Sicily. And this caused the Athenians to ultimately lose the war against Sparta, and it caused the Athenian Empire to collapse. You understand? And again, historians have been trying to figure out for a long time why the Athenians would do such a stupid thing as to send a huge army against Syracuse, because the risk of failure was catastrophic. And the only answer is, well, the Athenians had hubris. They never really lost a war. And they had become addicted to empire, which is the same situation America finds itself in today. Does that make sense, guys? So this has happened before in history, when the Athenians invaded Sicily and lost to Syracuse. Their entire army was wiped out in Syracuse because they couldn't resupply their army. Does that make sense? Right. The second example we can look at is the Vietnam War. So in the beginning of 1960, the beginning of the decade, most Americans have never heard of a country called Vietnam. Most Americans didn't know what it was, didn't know where it was. By the end of the decade, in 1969, half a million American soldiers were in the country, destroying everything, okay, but also getting destroyed themselves. 58,000 US soldiers died in Vietnam. So the question then is, how this happened? Why would this happen? 1960, Vietnam was a distant country no one's ever heard of. By the end of the decade, half a million US soldiers were in country fighting this war against an enemy they really didn't know. In 1971, the Pentagon Papers came out. And the Pentagon Papers was a history of America's involvement in the Vietnam War dating back to the 1950s. And it made three major points. The first point is that American leadership, military leadership, has spent spending the war in Vietnam without public knowledge, okay? This is what we call mission creep. So maybe at first they sent some observers to the country, then they sent some advisors and trainers, then soldiers, okay, so mission creep. Slowly over time, things escalate and you don't really understand why things escalate, but they do, okay? Second point is that American leadership from very early on knew the war was unwinnable. This was the greatest military in the world. They dropped more bombs in Vietnam in the 60s than all bombs were dropped in World War II, okay? And they could not win the war. The reason why is to win a war, you have to solve three problems, okay? The first problem is clear strategy, okay? What are you trying to accomplish in this country? What are your clear military objectives? Second is you must adapt to the battlefield, because all your best plans will change over the course of the battle. So the adversary that is most willing to adapt to the battlefield will win. The third thing is the will to fight. So if you want to look at a war, who's most likely to win the war, you ask these three questions. One, does this guy have clear military objectives that everyone understands? Because that will determine strategy, okay? Second is, is this guy adapting to the battlefield? And the third is, is this guy, does this guy still have the will to fight? If the answer is yes all three questions, then the person will most likely win the war. Okay, and if you look at the Vietnam War, even though America was killing a lot of people, it killed three million Vietnamese during the course of the war, it was not destroying the enemy's will to fight. In fact, it was making them angrier, and therefore more people were willing to fight the Americans, okay? So, from a very, so very early on, the American political leadership knew the war could not be won. So then the question then is, why did America stay in the war? And the answer is credibility. Credibility just means they didn't want to lose faith. They didn't want to be laughed at by the Chinese and by the Soviets and by the Europeans. But there's actually another way to understand credibility. And it's what we call the sunk cost fallacy. Have you guys heard of the sunk cost fallacy? And the idea is never ever go into a casino. The reason why is that when you go to the casino and you start losing money, at some point you cannot leave the casino, why not? Exactly, you want to reclaim the money you've lost, okay? You've invested so much that you cannot leave. You have to get that money back. And that's the problem with war. eventually you've invested so much, you cannot leave the war. And that's what happened in Vietnam. America invested so much, it didn't want to leave the war because it did not want to admit that all this has been lost. It's what we call the sunk cost fallacy. And that's why even though America could not win the war, it still want to fight the war. Does that make sense? So the Vietnam War is another example that is similar to this, where America invests enough soldiers that it refuses to lead the war and admit defeat, okay? Does that make sense, guys? All right, now let's look at one more example. And this is the most recent example, and it's the Russian-Ukraine war. Now, as you know, in February 2022, Putin ordered a special military operation against Ukraine. And this is Ukraine. And Russia attacked from three axes. The north to take Kiev, the capital. You have the east to take Donetsk. And then you have the south from Crimea to take the south. And as we know, the north failed. The north attack failed. And the Russians had to turn back. but the East and the South were successful. Now, let's think about this. You have an extremely powerful military attacking your country, the Ukraine. If you were the Ukrainian president, if you were the Ukrainian military, there's really only one way you can fight this war and win. And what is it? Using traditional military doctrine. How much you fight this war? You guys know? Let's go back to mass forces, the board and circle men, protects supply lines. How much you fight this war? There's only one way you can fight this war. Excuse me? How do you disrupt supply lines? There's only one way you can fight this war and win. And what is it? The enemy's attacking you, right? So what must you do? Okay, the answer is you must retreat. Okay? Why? The enemy's attacking, right? So you pull back your forces. Why would you do that? What's the logic of that? Exactly, okay? That's simple, okay? You want to overextend your enemy. Ukraine's a huge country, right? And Russia didn't send that many soldiers, maybe 160,000, that's not that many soldiers. So if you just give them space, they're gonna outrun the supply lines, okay? And then when they outruns the supply lines, you can encircle them and you can disrupt their supply. And that's the only way you can win the war, okay? What did the Ukrainians do instead? That's the only way to win this war, But what did the Ukrainians do instead, which made them lose the war? Yeah, so the Ukrainians refused to give up space, okay? They refused to give up land. They want to fight the Russians for every inch of territory. And eventually, because the Russians had more forces, mass forces, they were able to push through, okay? So that's the first major mistake that Ukraine made. But then last summer, Ukraine launched something called a counteroffensive, right? So once Russia was able to take space, and because Russia is a land army, it started to develop fortifications, defenses, okay? Mainly artillery. That's three lines of defenses. And in the summer offensive, the Ukrainian military, for whatever reason, sent tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of soldiers against this artillery and the Russians have blew up, okay? Now here's a question. Why are the Ukrainians doing this? They've lost the war now, right? They have no more soldiers. Right now the average age of the Ukrainian army is about, it's over 40 years old. They have guys in their 60s and 70s fighting in the military. They don't have enough manpower. The war is lost. Why would the Ukrainians do this? First of all, why would they fight for every inch of territory, and why would they launch a counter-offensive against a superior enemy? What's the problem? Okay, the first is the president, Zalinsky, the guy's a TV actor, okay? Which means that he doesn't think strategy, he just thinks what looks good on TV. So for the first two years of the war, We're watching this on TV, right? They looked as though the Ukrainians were going to win this war, right? I remember like two years ago, people were saying that the Ukrainians are going to march to Moscow and overthrow Putin. People were saying that, okay? And the reason why is that Zelensky is a master of public image manipulation, okay? He was distorting reality for people through television. The problem with that though is it's not reality guys, okay? Reality, the reality on the ground is very different from TV. Okay? So who else is like Zelensky in this world? Trump is exactly like Zelensky, okay? Do you understand? Trump is also concerned about what looks good on TV. He's like, I must look strong. We must look as though we're winning this war. He doesn't really care about strategy. So because of this, it's very likely that he orders a land invasion of Iran because it would look good on TV. So the problem with Zelensky is he cared about what looked good as opposed to actually what actually worked. But you also have other problems. Like you have extremists in the Ukrainian military. And guys, these extremists, they're Nazis. the neo-Nazis. And so the traditional understanding of Nazis are people who kill Jews, OK? But the Russians don't understand Nazis that way, because remember, Germany and the Soviet Union fought this war. So the Russians understood Nazis to be enemies of Russia who want to kill Russians. And there were many neo-Nazis in Ukraine. They hate Russia. They wanted to kill as many Russians as possible. And they're the ones who are pushing for as much war as possible. So they have these extremists in the Ukrainian military. The last reason is NATO. So it's an open secret that NATO is helping the Ukrainian military against Russia. You have NATO military advisors devising strategy against Russia. Okay, so it's most likely that the summer offensive last summer was a NATO plan, another Ukrainian plan, it's possible. We also know that NATO special forces are in the country directing missile strikes against Russian forces, okay? Which means what? If this is true, And if Ukraine loses the war, meaning that it doesn't have enough soldiers to continue to fight this war, what will NATO do? Yeah, yeah. I mean, according to what happened to Vietnam War and the Athenian expedition against Sicily, it is most likely that the most likely outcome will be that NATO sends its own troops against Russia. So Macron and France have said that we want to send French soldiers and the British prime minister has said that he is considering conscription for British people okay which means that young British citizens will be drafted into the army to fight Russia all right so these are three historical examples that are very similar to what could happened in Iran. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions before I continue? Is this clear so far? Now let's use another mode of analysis called game theory analysis. And this is what I've been teaching you this semester. And the idea is that society, what happens in the real world, is a game among human beings. So each person is trying to play this game as to optimize the outcome for that person. So the question then is why would the United States send 100,000 troops into Iraq? So let's look at the individual motivations of the individual players. So you have the United States. What does the United States want to do? What does it want to do? by doing what? And accomplishing what? It wants to topple the regime in Tehran, right? You can only do that for a grand invasion, OK? So the United States is trying to topple Iran. But then you also have other actors, OK? So Iran. What does Iran want to do? What does Iran want to do? Well, basically, they're representing Garh Khor. What do they want to do? They want to kill as many Americans as possible, okay? You understand? They want to force an American landing invasion, okay? So Iran wants to force a U.S. invasion, knowing that if the U.S. invades, it has to lose the war, okay? It will lose the war because the Revolution Guard can just send suicide bombers against the United States, okay? Now let's look at Israel. We know that the United States wants to topple Iran. We know that Iran wants to force a U.S. invasion to defeat the Americans, to humiliate the Americans, and exact revenge for what happened in the past, okay? What does Israel want to do? What is Israel's optimal outcome? You guys know? If you're Israel, what do you want to happen? Okay, so you want Iran to defeat it, okay? And then what do you want to happen? You want Iran to defeat it, you want the proxies to defeat it, and then what do you want to happen? Do you want the United States to stay in the Middle East? What happens in the United States? What happens in the United States in Iran both lose the war? I mean, Iran is destroyed as a country. The United States is destroyed as a military presence in the Middle East. What would happen? Israel becomes the top dog in the Middle East. You understand? Okay? Israel can now control the entire Middle East. So the optimal outcome for Israel is Iran and the United States are both destroyed. Okay? You understand? How about Saudi Arabia? What is their optimal outcome? Exactly the same as Israel, exactly. You understand? Which will leave the Middle East to Saudi Arabia and Israel. But Israel is a far superior military than Saudi Arabia. Remember, it's very easy to blow up Saudi Arabia. They have oil fields. Not that easy to blow up Israel. So Israel becomes a top dog. You understand game theory? In other words, all the major participants want an invasion of Iran, okay? But they want different outcomes. And Saudi Arabia and Israel most benefit if this situation happens, where you have 100,000 US troops in the country and they can't get out, okay? Because it becomes some cost policy. The United States can only point more soldiers. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so is this clear to you guys? Okay, you can now use historical analysis to get to this outcome, but you can also use game theory to get to this outcome. Any questions so far? Okay, great, okay. So, Celine asked the most pitiful question, okay? The United States has nuclear weapons, which is its ultimate trump card, right? So what Trump can say to tyrannous, like, I have 100,000 troops in country. You have to let them go, or I will nuke you, okay? You understand? Trump can say that. Listen. I'm Trump. I'm Donald Trump. I Need to look strong. I have a hundred thousand troops in the country I can't get them out of the country. So he says to turn you out of let them go Okay, you either get him guaranteed self safe passage out of the country or I will nuke you Right? So that's what that's what will happen. That is what Donald Trump will do once the situation arises The only way for Donald Trump to say phase is to threaten Tehran and says, you are letting my guys go or I will nuke the entire country. So how does Tehran get out of this situation? How do the Iranians protect themselves against this possibility? Because you have to be right, this is exactly what will happen if this situation will arise. Trump will respond with nuclear weapons or the threat of nuclear weapons. So what must the Iranians do to protect themselves against this possibility? Who can help the Iranians now? Russia, okay, do you understand? So before this war happens, Iran and Russia must come to an agreement where Putin sets me out from the onset, no one is allowed to use nuclear weapons, okay? If Iran uses nuclear weapons, I will nuke Iran. If the United States uses nuclear weapons, I will nuke the United States. If Israel uses nuclear weapons, I will nuke Israel. If Putin says that, how will the world react? If Putin says this, you are not allowed to use nuclear weapons, how will the world react? He's a hero, right? He saved humanity. But because he says this, the United States is now trapped. Okay? You understand? And so this becomes a black hole for the United States where they can only send in more troops. They can't get any troops out. They can only send in more troops. What's the problem with this? What's the problem with sending in more troops? No, there's actually a huge problem with this idea of sending in more troops. What is it? Okay, no one wants to go fight, you understand? The military cannot recruit soldiers, all right? But even if you did have enough troops, as Jack says, you can't resupply them, why? Why can't you actually resupply your army, why not? So there's a bigger problem than the supply lines. What is it? What do you need to create bullets and ammunition? America has no manufacturing capacity because America moved all its manufacturing capacity to China, remember this. So for every one ship that America can build, China can build 232 ships. That's what the Pentagon says. Okay, do you understand? So if this war were to happen, There's actually no way America can win this war. It's just completely trapped inside Iran. And once it becomes trapped, some cost fallacy comes into play. And America just puts in all its resources into the country, but it's a black hole. It cannot use nuclear weapons because Putin, I said from the onset, you are not allowed to use nuclear weapons. But another question then is, why would Putin do that? What would Putin involve himself in this war? And that's what we'll discuss next class, all right? How Putin sees this war and how Putin will react in this war. But before we end, are there any questions about any of this? Does this make sense to you guys? This is clear. Any questions? Oh, that's a great question, yeah. So the problem with Iraq is that Iraq isn't independent country. You understand? There are 10,000 American soldiers in Iraq. So you would need their permission. Even if you had their permission, there's a problem here because there are lots of Shia militiamen in Iraq who are loyal to Iraq. Okay? And they would see the American invasion force as something, as opportunity to attack the Americans, because they're still angry about the Americans for what happened in Iraq. But even if they could have a staging area in Iraq, they still have to deal with mountains. Do you understand? I mean, the problem is you have 100,000 troops in the country. You have to get out of the country. It's very hard to get them out of the country. If you go through the mountains, you're going to get ambushed in the mountains. If you go through the air, those drones are going to strike you down. That's the issue. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Great, great. So on Friday we'll talk about Putin."}

Today we start the Vikings. We will do it over two classes and the Vikings are extremely interesting and I believe that they are one of the most underappreciated and misunderstood European cultures. In the Western tradition, there are There are two main pillars, the Greco-Romans and the Judeo-Christians. Before traditions, the Greeks, the Romans, the Jews, the Christians have been overstudied and overappreciated. I would argue that the Vikings are very important and should be part of these four pillars. I think there should be five pillars. And I think that over the next few decades, people will, scholars will slowly reveal to us the importance of Viking culture to the development of Western civilization. So that's my argument to you over the next two classes, that the Vikings are extremely influential. And so today I'll do an overview of Viking history and influence. In the next class, I'll focus more on the cultural system of the Vikings, what they believed, and how they understood the world. Okay, so let's do a brief historical overview. So the Viking Age is what scholars termed the period from the year 793 to 1066. 793 is when there was the first recorded, written down incident of a Viking raid on a monastery in Europe. And this is really one of the first written records of the Vikings. The Vikings were always there actually, and there was some interaction between the Vikings and the rest of Europe. For example, Vikings did serve as mercenaries in the Roman Empire. So there was always a bit of interaction, but for the most part, the Vikings or an isolated culture. 1066, the year that the Viking Age is supposedly to have ended, is the year of the Battle of Hastings. That is when Normandy, the Normans who lived in France, they crossed English Channel and conquered England. And this is the last time that England would be conquered. And this would mark the end of the Viking Age, because it really marked the assimilation or integration of Viking culture into the broader European framework. So that's what scholars mean by the Viking Age. All right, so the Vikings are from the three countries. Today we call Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Collectively they are known as the Scandinavian countries. What's interesting about this area is the geography. This is a topography, okay? Red means high altitude, blue means low altitude, so by the sea. And as you can see from the topography, the Schedemann area is extremely diverse. And as a result, the region historically has been very poor, isolated, and diverse. Okay, so this area for the longest time had tremendous diversity in terms of culture and politics. You had kings, you had tribal chieftains, and then you had different systems as well. During the Viking Age, what we need to keep in mind is this was a period in history when Europe was being invaded or attacked or pillaged from everyone basically. So the three main invaders are the Vikings who come in from the north, but then you have people called the Magyards, who are the modern day Hungarians, coming in from the east. From the south comes the Arabs. Next week we will do the Arabs. The Magyars, just that you know who the Magyars are, they are just the most recent iteration of the proto-Indo-Europeans, the Yamnaya. Remember last semester we discussed that three to 4,000 years ago, old Europe, which was mainly an agricultural society, they were eventually invaded and conquered by the proto-Indo-Europeans, the Yamnaya, who lived in the steppes. These are pastoral nomads. And as a result, they brought their culture to them. So the Maggards are just the most recent iteration of this culture. Same as the Huns, same as the Gauls, same as the Germanic people. What's interesting about the Maggards is that they are mainly a land people, meaning they ride horses into battle. And during the Viking Age, they were extremely successful, penetrating into many parts of Europe before they are eventually defeated and they're integrated into the main European culture, mainly by, you guys remember, making into Christians, right? That's how you assimilate people in Europe by turning them into Christians. And because this is the Western Europe, a lot of them become Catholic, but some also become Orthodox as well. The Vikings are a very different culture because they attack Europe not by land, not with cavalry and horses, but by sea and rivers. This is a maritime people. And what's really interesting about the Vikings is how far they extend across the world. So the first sort of encounter is when the Vikings start to raid and pillage Europe, okay, northern and central Europe. But over time, what they will do is they will extend over to the east as well, where they will found two major settlements. The first is Kiev in modern-day Ukraine, as well as Novograd. So they are going into the Denebriy as well as the Volkl. Why are they here? There's some pillaging, but mainly it's for trade purposes. Because if you look at where they are in Kiev and Novograd, it gives them access to three major centers of global wealth. The first, of course, is the Bajinian Empire in Kasana Po, which we studied, then there is something called the Abbasid Caliphate, which is the Islamic Empire in Baghdad. And the third, of course, is the Silk Road, which gives them access to China. So in other words, the Vikings encountered every major culture in the world at this time through their trade routes. And then what they will also do is go west to found colonies. They will make settlements in Iceland, in Greenland, and in modern day Canada. The settlement is called Vynland, and it's in modern day Newfoundland. So Iceland is still with us today. And Iceland is very interesting for three reasons. The first reason is, even though in this class, I keep on saying, there's no such thing as cultural and genetic purity, that the Icelanders come pretty close. There's about 330,000 people who live in Iceland today, and they're all related to each other. And that's because for the longest time, Iceland has been isolated from the rest of the world. It has always been extremely peaceful, egalitarian, and progressive society. They had the world's first concept of parliament called the All-Thing. That's where every citizen would come together once a year to discuss the major political events of Iceland. So in other words, they really built the cornerstone of modern European democracy. But not only that, but a lot of the stories, the mythology of the Vikings were, we conceptualized and written down in Iceland. And these sagas, they're called sagas, okay, would become the foundation of modern European literature. So the cultural contribution of Iceland and the wider, like in culture, to the European cultural framework, it cannot be overstated. Also, they will make their way to the British Isles. They will have major encounters with the British people as well as the Irish people. They will found a new city in Ireland called Dublin, which as you know is the modern day capital of Ireland. And what they will also do is, they will settle down in Normandy. And the reason why is they keep on attacking Northern Europe, mainly the Correlation Empire. And Charles is simple, the king of the Correlation Empire, he will defeat them in a battle. And then he will give them land in Normandy. So Normandy means land of the Norse people. And then from Normandy, as I mentioned, they will cross the English Channel and conquer England in the year 1066 at the Battle of Hastings. So if you look at this map, what you will discover is the Vikings either founded or influenced for major European civilizations. They are Germany, France, Britain, and Russia. Now what's interesting is that for the past 500 years, These four nations were the dominant militaries in the world. And not only that, but they were the dominant civilizations in the world. We think of modern Western civilization, we really mean these four nations, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. That's where the very best literature, philosophy, and art comes from. And what I will show you next class, not this class, But what I'll show you in the next class is, this is not just a historical coincidence. There are reasons and factors that will help us better explain why this happened. This is the settlement in Newfoundland. So this was actually the first European settlement in the New World, North America. And this is 500 years, at least five and five years before Christopher Columbus. This is a map that shows the Viking expansion over time. So as you can see from this map, they basically expand outwards. And as they gather more information about the world, they continue to expand. So what is the culture, what is the mentality of the worldview that drives this aggressive expansion? What is the Viking worldview? And this is something that I will introduce this class, but explain more in detail next class. So today when we think of the Vikings, we just think of raiders and pillagers. But what's important for us to remember is that the larger Viking culture, most people did not do that. Most people when they engage with the European world, It was mainly food trade. The vast majority was food trade. And then you have people, Vikings, who joined the European world as mercenaries because they were very good fighters. And then you had a small minority who were raiders and pillagers. But because they were so violent, they captured the imagination of the Europeans and they informed how we today see the Vikings. This is a map of the Viking expansion and the yellow are written records documented Viking raids in Europe. As you can see there's a lot of them okay. They're mainly by the coast, they're mainly by rivers because again the Vikings raided mainly by using their long ships, their ships. They mainly We rated monasteries. And to better understand monasteries, what they were, imagine that they are the equivalent of universities. They're basically the medieval equivalent of universities. These are places where monks spent most of the time worshiping God by celebrating his literary works, mainly the Bible. Okay? So the monasteries were built during the call the Caroligian Renaissance, and this marked the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire. During this time, there's a major focus, the major cultural focus was on producing books. Our modern conception of the book actually comes from this period. They took all this sort of diverse innovation, such as printing, book making, fonts, ink, and combined with a system of book binding that we still use today. Okay, so they mainly focus on religious classics like the Bible, okay? And what they would do is they would illustrate them. It would take about 20 to 30 years for an individual monk to create one of these books. So it was an artwork basically. During this time, they experimented with different fonts. If you go to your computer and you ask Microsoft Word what kind of font you wanna use, like Collegian or others, a lot of these fonts were actually invented during this time. They also invented book binding at this time as well. And what they would do to mark their cultural achievement is they would make covers of gold and jewels, diamonds, sapphires, rubies, as a book cover. So these were extremely valuable, unique artwork. This is another book cover, extremely gorgeous. Again, they would spend a lot of resources, 20, 30 years, in crafting each of these books. And that's why the Vikings raided them, because the Vikings knew through the trade networks that the monasteries had this contribution of wealth in them. There's a lot of gold and silver and jewelry in monasteries. And in the Lichenkultur, these precious metals were a status symbol. They wanted them. But you can imagine what the Vikings did because the Vikings were a pagan, non-literate people. They didn't understand books, they didn't have no use for books. So they would come in and they would take these books, the Bible, rip out the pages, and keep the gold, and then leave. So you're a monk and you see this. And it's the equivalent of having your child killed before you. It was extremely traumatic for them. And again, the monks are illiterate people. So they had actually nothing nice to say about the Vikings. In fact, they thought that the Vikings were basically the equivalent of Satan. And that's why we have such a negative understanding of the Vikings, mainly through these raids, which again, were only a minority of Viking activity during this time. Gradually over time what would happen is that as the Vikings made more wealth from monasteries, word would spread back to the larger Viking culture and more and more people would partake in these raids until eventually they develop the skill, the systems and technology to sack even cities like Paris, which was a heavily fortified city. And they would do this multiple times during the Viking Age. So what's important for us to understand is that these Viking raids would drive population growth in Scandinavia, and then this would drive further Viking expansion throughout the world. Okay? So it was a cycle. Let's look at some cultural aspects of the Vikings. So these are pictures of high status, meaning basically warriors in the Scandinavian culture. And this is a picture of these Vikings in the East. They are called the Rus. The Rus. And the Rus would become Russia. So Russia, the country, would borrow its name from the Vikings, Rus. So some things to, I will point out about these visuals. Look at the helmets, OK? The Vikings, the popular depiction of the Vikings is they had helmets of horns, right? Have you seen movies? They did not have horns, guys, because horns are extremely unpromatic and practical, OK? you might get stuck on your boat or your enemy could yank it off you, okay? So these were extremely practical and utilitarian people. They were not that wealthy. They'd be very careful and conscious about everything they did. Okay, so that's the first thing. Second thing is that you will see major cultural differences between Western Vikings and Eastern Vikings. The reason why is as the Vikings are interacting with different cultures, they're also assembling themselves into different cultures. They're intermarrying, they're adopting local languages and local cultures, and they're also landing their own culture to these cultures, okay? So history is a continuous process of cultural integration. It's dynamic process, it never really ends. The third thing we need to appreciate is these are a poor people. And as such, they're extremely egalitarian. Even though these are high status people, they're not that different from the majority of Vikings who are independent farmers basically. This is where they usually live. This is called a long house. And so because the weather in Scandinavia, it's very cold for most of the year, these are very social people. They live together, they spend most of the time together. So this is a picture of a liking hall. Most of the time, the Vikings are together and they're usually drinking and they're telling stories to each other. And so they're very much focused on the oral tradition. Let's look very quickly at their long ships, which is the dominant maritime technology all of the day. These are not that big, but they are purposely designed to be small so that they have flexibility and maneuverability. So this is what we think the ships look like. And this is what they really look like. So some points we need to know about the ships is, first of all, from these ships, you can see that there's really no hierarchy in place. We don't know who the captain is. There's a captain, but he's really not that different from the others, okay? So the Viking culture is extremely egalitarian, which is important if you want cohesion on the battlefield. These, the Vikings raided for gold but also for slaves. So they were trading with the wider world, the Arabs, the Byzantines, the Chinese. What they were trading were slaves in exchange for silver, which was very important for their culture. So these were slavers. The other thing to know about these ships is, they're not that big. And the reason why is, They're usually traversing rivers. When you're traversing rivers, you need to be flexible. So sometimes you might hit some rocks. Well, then what you have to do is move that ship out of those rocks and go somewhere else, okay? All right, so that's the idea of the long ships. And again, this was the dominant maritime technology of that time. The Europeans had absolutely no way to counter this. Okay, also what's important for us to understand is the Vikings had also many different designs. So the thing about the Viking ships is they're extremely lean and mean. They're extremely efficient. The only way you can achieve this efficiency is through constant innovation. So the Vikings are constantly always thinking about how to better improve these ships. The last thing I will mention is the idea of the Viking funeral. Now, in cultures that we've studied, there's always spectacle that is the highlight of this culture. So the Romans, there's something called the triumph, which was a military parade to celebrate a general's military victories overseas. It was like the biggest event in the life of a Roman. So this would be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize today. The Greeks had, as equivalent of a triumph, theater, right? Every Greek wanted to be a playwright that was the highlight of Ethiopian cultural life. What's interesting for us is that for the Vikings, the spectacle that they cared the most about was a funeral, OK? Obviously not everyone would get an elaborate funeral. Only the chieftains or the great warriors would get an elaborate funeral. But these funerals would take 10 days and it would be very expensive. Basically the entire savings of this great warrior would be invested in the funeral. There would be a lot of sacrifices, mainly horse and animals. Humans would be sacrificed as well. And the warrior, the king, will be buried with his ship. So next class, what I will do is go into detail about these funerals, explaining why they happen and the cultural significance. So that's an overview of the Vikings. What I will do now is explain the Vikings and the larger historical framework that we've been studying this semester. But before I do that, are there any questions about the Vikings? Yes? Okay, so the slave trade, right? Okay, so the slave trade, it is just an integral, interesting part of life in Europe at this time. The population was very limited because Europe was a poor place and there was very few agricultural surplus. Plus there was always these wars to be fought, okay? So slavery was very important. The people who really drove the slave trade were the Byzantines and the Arabs. And there's always demand from these two cultural centers for slaves, which the Vikings provided. Now what's interesting for us about the slave trade is the Arabs are Muslim and the Byzantines are Christian. And the consensus at that time is You cannot enslave a fellow believer. So Arabs could not enslave Muslims. Christians could not enslave fellow Christians. That's why the Vikings were so, that's why the Vikings found slave trade so profitable. Because the Vikings were pagans. So in theory, they could be sold to anyone. Okay? So the Vikings basically enslaved other pagans and sold them to both the Byzantines and the Arabs. And look, look, the slave trade, it has been an integral part of human reaction, human trade for most of civilization. Does that make sense? It's really only until the British Empire that we see a clamped down and abolishment of the slave trade. But also guys, I mean I hate to say this, But slavery still happens. It just happens secretly. We don't really pay much attention to it. But it still happens. OK, great question. Any more questions before I continue? We can be discovered in the graves from where the ships were. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Since then, did you know if anyone could conduct peace? Yeah. So the question then is, we found in the, like, archaeologists have found a lot of these ship burials, a lot of graves, and there's just a lot of them. And we've had a chance to study a lot of these graves. And here's some interesting characteristics about these graves, okay? The first thing is, these graves are unique unto themselves. There doesn't seem to be a system of burying someone, Okay, so you have these graves where maybe a woman is buried of a horse, and you have another grave where a woman is buried of a ship. That's the first really interesting thing about these graves. Second thing is these graves seem to have a record of lineage. And what we mean by that is these people are buried on top of their ancestors. So if a woman is buried here, then maybe her granddaughter would be buried on top of her. So there seems to be a story going on in these burials. The third thing about these graves that we've discovered is that there's been a lot of care and attention paid to how someone was buried. Clearly someone put a lot of thought, or the culture has put a lot of thought into how this person will be remembered. What I will show you next class is what's important is not the burial. What's important is the funeral, the process of the burial, and that's where the culture expresses itself. And what I will show you in the next class is these burials, they're meant to send the dead into the afterlife. And that's very important. What's really important, and why they have this pageantry or ritual in the funeral process is, it's really about memorizing that person into the larger culture, making sure that everyone remembers the contributions of that person and having that person contribute eternally into the overall culture. That makes sense. But again, as you know, most of these graves have not been dug up. So right now, we are making some rudimentary guesses based on available evidence. All right. Any more questions before I continue? So I know this is a lot to take in, but we are spending two classes on this. And hopefully, this will make more sense to you as we move along. All right, good. So let me discuss the larger historical framework that the Vikings are in. OK. So the major thesis of the semester is the idea of the oceanic currents of history. And so one pattern that we see in history is a culture, you know, what we call the borderlands. They're isolated from most of history. OK? They're not completely isolated, but they're mainly isolated. And then what happens is that an empire, a major civilization, expands so that it starts to interact with this borderline culture. And what will happen for this inaction is the energy of the empire will start to transfer to the borderlands. And the borderlands itself will expand, OK? And until it comes into conflict with the empire. And when this conflict happens, the borderlands might be assimilated into the empire. It might be destroyed by the empire. Or it might become the empire itself. So that's the major idea of this class. And we see this throughout history. So think of the Greeks and the Persians. Think of the Romans and the Carthaginians. Think of the Arabs and the Persians. So we see this pattern repeated itself throughout history. What I want to do now is apply this idea to the Vikings and explain how this process works. Why does this work? Well, if you think about it, an empire, and what I mean empire, I just mean large civilization. An empire and a borderland culture, they are almost complete opposites of each other. Their advantages, they compensate for each other's advantages and disadvantages. So for an empire, an empire usually has three major advantages. They are mass, organization, and death. Some historians use the word strategic death. All right. So what do we mean by this? Mass is a very simple idea. It just means a lot, a lot of people. Very simple idea. Second idea, organization means that there's a hierarchy in place that allows the empire to organize its people in a way that most benefits the empire. So for example, the empire can field large armies. And the idea of strategic depth is that the Empire can actually afford to lose a lot of battles and still continue to fight. So think about when Alexander invaded Persia. He had already defeated the Persians at the battle of Isis, but Darius was able to go deeper into his empire and assemble another large army for the battle of Guatemala. And Darius could have, when he lost that battle, he could have also built a third army, but ultimately he was assassinated by his generals. On the other hand, Alexander the Macedonian, he could not have afford to lose one battle. All right? If you think about the World War II, Japan had already conquered China's entire eastern seaboard, but the Gouming Deng under Chiang Kai-shek refused to surrender. And he didn't have to surrender because he could go in that, right? He first went into Chongqing and then Chengdu. And if he had to, he would have gone to Kunming as well. Okay, so that's the idea of strategic death. Also, remember in the history of Rome, Hannibal had won every single battle on the Italian peninsula. He had destroyed all Roman armies. But because of the idea of death, Rome did not have to surrender. And Rome only won one battle against Hannibal in its history, but that battle was the only battle that really mattered. It was a battle of Zama between Cypio, Africanus, the Roman general, and Hannibal. And Hannibal lost that battle, and so therefore Carthage lost the Second Punic War. That's the idea of death. That's the three major advantages of empire. If you are a borderland, you have none of these advantages. but you have three other advantages that compensate for your weakness, okay? The first is the idea of energy. So you have fewer people, but they're more energetic. They're more ambitious, they're stronger, they're more aggressive overall. Second, you don't have organization, okay? But you have openness. And the idea here is you are open to new ideas. ideas and you can change as a society at will. And the reason why is we said this when we talked about Yam Nair, okay? There's a very important principle that drives innovation. It's called open, cooperative, competition. That's why the Yam Nair were able to innovate. That's why the Greeks were able to innovate. Open means there's no central authority. There's no government. Cooperative means that you're separate, but you're still learning from each other. Competition means you want to be better than your neighbor. Okay? And that's true for the Vikings as well. And that's how they were able to develop the ship technology that enabled them to pillage across Europe. Okay? So that's the main advantage of the borderlands. Okay? Doesn't make sense. Okay? Okay. So again, the borderlands have no death. They can be worked up by an empire very quickly. That's why the borderlands are opportunistic. It's a very important idea. It basically means the borderlands have to be strategic in picking their fights. If you are bigger than me and stronger than me, I'll be your friend. But if you're weaker than me, then I will steal from you. The idea is opportunistic. You're shameless in taking advantage of those who you can. Doesn't make sense. So these are the three major advantages of the Borderlands. And I want you to remember this idea because it will repeat itself over and over. All right, so let me very quickly explain the idea of energy and mass. And for this, let's do a thought experiment. Let's pretend that you are 16 year old in Scandinavia and you're about 800, okay? That's when the Viking Age begins. By age 16, what have you learned? What have you mastered? Well, your family are basically independent farmers who will engage in trade in order to supplement their income, okay? So this is what you can do. You can basically work the farm. Work the farm basically means you know how to grow your own food. You know how to cook your own food. It means you know how to take care of animals. If a cow is about to give birth to a calf, you know how to do so. You know how to save the life of a horse. You know how to speak with a horse. You also engage in sea trade, okay? And the idea here is that you know how to cut wood and from the wood, build a boat. And you know how to weed the stars and sail across Europe, okay? Also, you're a good fighter. You're able to wield an axe as a weapon. You're able to use a sword as a weapon. You're able to shoot an arrow. If I dropped you anywhere in Scandinavia, you're able to find your way home. You'll be able to fight wolves. You'll be able to feed yourself in the forest. And you'll be able to find yourself home. If I put you anywhere in the European world, you'll know how to navigate yourself as to find yourself home. And so this builds the idea that the Vikings at age 16, they're extremely worldly people, okay? They're strong. What I mean worldly, I don't mean cosmopolitan. What I mean is they have street smarts, okay? They're very strong and they're very resilient, all right? That's what a Viking teenager looks like. Now let's come back to China in the present day. And what do you guys do? What are you guys able to do? Two things, okay? Memorize useless facts, do stupid tests, okay? I'm sorry to tell you the truth, but this is the truth, right? You throughout your education in China have learned exactly two things. Memorize useless facts and do stupid tests, all right? And the reason why China is like this, the way that, the reason why most martial societies or like this is they want to reduce your energy, right? They want to be able to control you. They want you to fit into a larger society. Doesn't make sense. So now you can see the difference between an energetic society like the Vikings and a mass society like China. I am, I'll be very serious with you. I have three young kids. My eldest is seven. My second one is almost four. my youngest is only one. As you know, I received a very good education. I was at Yale College for my undergraduate. And I've spent the past 20, 30 years thinking deeply about education. And I'll be very honest with you. If I had a choice whether to send my child to Yale or to Viking school, I would send my kid to Viking school because I want my child to be worldly strong and resilient. Okay? All right? And yeah, I'm not joking guys. If there was such a thing as a Viking school where you learn to be a Viking, I would send my kids to that school. Unfortunately, there isn't. Okay, let's talk about the idea of opportunistic. So the question that scholars have debated for a long time is, why did the Viking Age start? What prompted the beginning of a Viking Age? Why did the Vikings go attack these monasteries? And there are different theories. The most popular theory is that as Charlemagne and this Holy Roman Empire expanded, it threatened Scandinavia. And so the Vikings had to come out and challenge him. That's the most popular historical understanding. And then there's some other theories. For example, population growth, climate change, internal conflict within Scandinavia. Today, I want to explain a different theory to you, which is just that the Vikings were opportunistic. Opportunity arose that didn't exist before, and they took advantage of it. The opportunity are monasteries. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, everyone believes that Europe became a lot poorer. And that's an historical understanding. But you think about it, what really happened is that wealth became much more distributed. During the time of empire, all wealth was being channeled into certain centers. When we don't have an empire, then farmers can keep the wealth for themselves. So at the clout of the Roman Empire, wealth was much more distributed. But as these kingdoms start to arise under Charlemagne, then wealth became much more concentrated. Okay? So these monasteries, they are universities, they are places of worship and of learning, but much more importantly, they are places where wealth is concentrated. Okay? Concentration of wealth. These monasteries, like modern day universities, are extremely wealthy. Okay? The first reason why they're wealthy is they're becs. So the nobility was actually storing the surplus wealth, meaning silver and gold in these monasteries. These monasteries were considered to be protected by divine power, right? No one would dare steal from a monastery monks are extremely trustworthy. So these monasteries had a lot of gold and silver stored and hidden within their premises. Not only that, but the monasteries were landowners. So they controlled up to 20% of local land. And of course what they would do is, they would take this land and lease it out to farmers. And they made a lot of money that way. They themselves engage in their own businesses. For example, they have their own breweries. They could make and sell alcohol and beer to locals. Also, as you can imagine, because these are religious centers, the locals would invest heavily in them. The locals would give them treasures. And as you can imagine, because there was this constitutional wealth, and because monasteries were not protected, because they were considered protected by God, they made perfect places to pillage. Vikings knew all of these places, and so these places were perfect to pillage. And that's what we started the Viking Age, the fact that wealth was to be concentrated whereas before it wasn't. All right, some more stories. Then you had the idea of armor knights. So the main military innovation in Europe at this time were these tanks called armor knights. They were fantastic in battle. That's how Charlemagne was able to build the Holy Roman Empire. Okay, when you think about it, Armored knights do not like water. They will drown in water. And so these rivers were completely unprotected. And the Vikings had these long ships that were perfect for river navigation. So that was another opportunity that presented itself. The armored knights would give rise to the idea of feudalism. Fuedalism just basically means that these armored knights became land owner, land owning nobles that took advantage of farmers. So in order to get these knights to fight for them, kings would give them land grants. These knights would take this land and run it to farmers. Over time, as we know, farmers will incur a lot of debt. Which means that they will not become slaves to these nobles, and this is the idea of feudalism. Okay? And what this means is that by the time the Vikings attacked, Europe was becoming a very hierarchical society. The thing about hierarchies is they don't like to change. So one question historians had is, well, why didn't the Europeans adapt themselves to these Viking raids? Some did, but most didn't. And the reason why is if you change your military tactic in order to respond to like and threat, you have to change your hierarchy. You have to change your cultural hierarchy. Remember when we did the Greeks, we learned that depending on your society, the structure of your society, you had a different military. So you were a navy, like Athens, you were a democracy. If you had a cavalry like the Macedonians, you were a monarch. If you had hoplites like the Spartans, you were an Arlargarchy. So the structure of your military determined the structure of your political system. So the Europeans purposely did not respond to the liking threat because they wanted to maintain their feudal system. And of course this is a very general statement. A lot did respond to liking threat, but overall, they did not respond to liking threat with the same emergency or sense of anxiety that they should have. The liking age came to an end when the Vikings amassed enough wealth to align themselves with the European nobility. So the idea here is if you're abandoned and you steal a lot of money, what do you want to do? aristocrat because that's the best way to protect your wealth, right? Once you're an aristocrat, your wealth becomes legitimate. So the Vikings, once they amassed enough wealth, the Europeans start to intermarry with them. And the Vikings in turn became Christians because that was the best way to assimilate. And as Christians, they would convert their own followers and their own people as well. Remember, the spread of religion is usually a top-down process where you first convert the elite, who then convert the people. It is not a bottom-up process. And also, the Vikings provided military protection and support to the European powers. And that's what ended the Viking Age. The Vikings were so successful that they were eventually co-opted into the European nobility. So as I mentioned, the Vikings, their culture would heavily influence foreign civilizations that we'll discuss later on in the semester. And they are the British, the English, the French, the Germans, and the Russians. And so what I'll do next class is show you why liking culture is so influential. And to prepare for the next class, what I wanna do is give you a preview of how the liking worldview is very different from other worldviews. So there's a pre-modern understanding of the world and there's a modern understanding of the world. Okay, so in the modern understanding of the world, the world we live in today, the community is distinct from the individual. Okay? The individual can be outside the community. Okay? That's why even though you are Chinese, you're still able to go to America because you as an individual can be separated from your community. And often in the modern world, we believe that the community and individual are in conflict with each other. So for example, if you are a woman, historically you have been oppressed by your community. If you are homosexual, the same is true. If you're a minority, you're often oppressed. And that's what justifies the idea of a nation state. The nation state is an entity that protects the rights of all individuals against the community. So that's a minor conception of the individual. And we'll go into this later on in the semester towards the end, because it's a very important concept. But first, I want to introduce it to you. Now, historically, most cultures have not believed this. Most cultures have believed that the individual can only exist within the community. The community is that which gives you history, tradition, and a worldview, a religion, a mythology. And it's your interpretation of these things that allow for your individuality. But you cannot exist outside this tradition. That's why most cultures, the worst punishment inflicted on the individual was not execution, it was actually banishment. If you killed someone, we didn't kill you, we banish you from the community. Because that was considered the worst possible punishment to a person. You cease to be an individual, you cease to be alive, if you're removed from the community, that gives you nourishment. Now, but within this tradition, within this understanding, there are different ways you can conceptualize the idea of the community and the individual, okay? So for example, let's look at the Greeks. The Greeks, sorry, let me do this. The Greeks believed that the community was the polis, the polis, and that's where we get the word politics from. The polis is a place where people gather in order to discuss the political affairs of the community, okay? That's where community was. It was where people came together to discuss politics. And as a result, the individual is someone who stands out. That's why we have concepts, erotate and eudaimonia. In this community, you are the best individual if you can speak the best, if you can argue the best, if you can stand out. So the prime purpose of Greek life was to stand out so you could achieve your ammonia, human flourishing, as well as achieve erite, human excellence. That is the Greek understanding. Then you have the Romans. The Romans defy community as tradition and history and place. As long as you are in Rome and you believe in Roman history and practice Roman tradition, then you are a Roman citizen. Okay? Doesn't matter where you come from, as long as you're in Rome, you practice Roman traditions, then you are a Roman. That's why for Romans, what's important is for the individual to be pious. Right? Individual is a pious person. Someone who is loyal to, to, to, to, sorry, Someone who is loyal to the traditions of Rome and who extends the traditions of Rome through conquest. That's why everyone wanted to be a general like Julius Caesar to ingloriate for Rome. And that's how you show piety to Rome. Okay? So we did the Greeks and the Romans. Now the Vikings are very different. The Vikings are very different people. For them, community and the individual are very different. The community is a collection of stories. The community are stories that are told over and over by the people inside the community. And as such, the individual has responsibly to add to the story. How do you add to the story? through exploration, through adventure, through personal courage. That's why the Vikings went off to settle Iceland and Greenland. That's why they pillaged these monasteries in the South. That's why they went to the East and found settlements like Kiev and Novograd and traded with the wider world because they were trying to add to the larger stories of the Viking community. And that's what's important for them. to be remembered by the community through adventure and exploration. That's a very different concept. And this is what I will explain next class, how the entire culture revolved around this understanding of the community and the individual. The last thing I will say is what's really interesting for us is remember that these three different cultures are extremely different, right? They have a very different approach to the world. But they all come from the same cultural origin, which is the proto-Indo-European culture, right? What's interesting is that as they came into Europe and they settled down in different geographic locations and they acted with different people, they adapted their culture accordingly. So the story of human history is always one of innovation, change, and resilience. All right, great. Any questions before I conclude the class? Or is there anything you're not clear about? OK. OK. So the idea of intermarriage, OK? What is the idea of intermarriage? OK. So what's really hard for us to understand is that for most of human history, we didn't have a concept of race, culture, ethnicity, and borders and states, okay? These are all modern concepts that we use to apply to history. They're not very useful. So what I mean by that is the Vikings didn't see themselves as a distinct culture. They didn't think we're Vikings, we are not Greeks, we're not Germans. No one saw themselves that way. The Germans broke the, sorry, the Vikings, their main political unit was the village or the tribe, right? And the way they fought wars is these tribes would join into temporary confederations. But these confederations were extremely fluid. So if you're a tribe and you want to switch alliances, you could do so and it won't stop you, okay? So the very idea of identity was extremely fluid. And what they understood was, in order to survive the world, you have to build alliances. That means you build alliances with other Vikings. But if you could, you also want to build alliances with the European nobility, because they have far more wealth, technology, and resources than you do. So when the opportunity presented itself for them to intermarry into European nobility, then they did so. So for example, the Byzantines. The Byzantine Empire was, as we discussed, a walled empire. So it was impossible to invade and conquer. The Europeans, the Vikings couldn't really conquer the Byzantine Empire. But at the same time, because they were close in, the Byzantines couldn't really protect their empire. So the only way they could protect their empire was not through the military, but through diplomacy, through bribery, through intermarriages. So the Vikings in Kiev, the Byzantines made an offer. We will let you guys marry into the empire. Basically by having their ruler marry a princess. But on the condition, of course, that you now serve the empire and that you convert to Christianity, Orthodox Christianity. And as you can see, this makes sense for everyone. The Byzantines now have more soldiers who are proven and who have their own territory. And the nobility in Kiev, like basically the prince, he now has legitimacy, because he's also fighting against the other Vikings in the area. Does that make sense? And that's the idea of intermarriage, to form a political alliance that benefits you. And ultimately, if you are a ruler of prince, you're always looking to intermarry as much as possible. That's why these kings had so many wives. These wives represented different political alliances. It wasn't because he was really horny and he loved sex. was because as a prince, as a king, you have to have different alliances. And the best way to form an alliance was through intermarriage. But if you marry someone, you must also marry into her faith, okay? That was a precondition. And that's why the Vikings in Kiev would convert to Christianity. The king converted and then the king would make his followers convert. But it's a process that would take generations, okay? These things are are very slow because as I keep on saying in this class, culture is persistent. Do you understand? Great question, okay. Any more questions? Okay, so the question then is how, like where are these pre-modern cultures, these pagan culture tolerant? How do they perceive gays and minorities? Okay, this is a propaganda from the nation state, okay? This is what you're taught today, that we are much higher civilization because we're much more tolerant towards minorities. And the truth of the matter is, again, when you live in a culture which doesn't really have boundaries and borders, you're a pretty open person. So in the pagan culture, there just isn't the idea of homosexuality. Men have sex with each other all the time and no one cared, okay? And women had fewer rights, but in the Viking culture, women had status, often because they were, they practiced magic. In their culture, men weren't allowed to practice magic. Women practiced magic. And as you can imagine, that would give women tremendous status. So the idea that we have that community suppress the individual is something that we believe. We are faving it. But it just is not historically true. Okay? Also remember, there's a fluidity within these communities. So it's perfectly possible for you to get up with your family and move somewhere else. No one could stop you. Okay? Does that make sense? So the pre-modern world was much more tolerant than the world we live in today, mainly because we did not categorize people back then. Okay? So one thing that we will learn later on on a semester is that the idea of race and racism, it's a new modern concept that didn't exist before. We only have this because of the idea of imperialism. When you go and talk about other people, you need to justify it somehow. And the best way to do it is through racism, because they are in inferior race, and therefore we have come to civilize them. But this is only the past 20 years. And before, we didn't have a concept of race. All right, great question. Any more questions? Fluid. Yeah? Okay, the Vikings? Okay, the Vikings, their worst punishment is banishment as well. So for example, if you killed someone, you'd be banished, okay? The actual punishment would be determined by a community discussion, but it was usually banishment or exile for a number of years. So in Athens, you would be banished for at most 10 years. That was considered like the most grievous, If you commit the most grievous crime, then the worst punishment would be banishment for like 10 years. Because the understanding was that the worst thing that could happen to you is banishment. Because again, the individual is part of the community. You were nourished by the community. By the community, you were a nobody. You were basically a ghost or a zombie. Yes. Yes, they always come back. Yes. The Athenians banished a lot of people, okay? And they always came back. And if they banished, they're always thinking about coming back, because again, there was no idea of the individual existing outside the community. You were the community. And if you came into a new community, then people just assumed that you were a bad person. And you were ostracized because, where's your community, man? Because so in the ancient world, the first question they would always ask you is, not what is your name, but where are you from? What is your community? Because that's what matters. Not what is your name, what do you like, who are you? It's always like, where are you from? From what family, from what community, from what clan, what tribe are you from? Then we know how to interact with you. Great, great. Any more questions? Great, okay. So next class, we will do the cultural system, the cultural worldview of the Vikings. We'll take the idea of community individual and expand it."}

Now, as a society, every society has a problem. The problem is how do we organize the thinking of the people within our society? Okay, how do you create an identity? In modern society, there are three institutions that create a collective identity for society. Okay, so the first would be what? Exactly, thank you schools, right? So public schools you're here to learn about the history of China You're here to learn about the politics of China, right? The idea is to make everyone think alike or have the same basic Knowledge and world of you. Okay. What's another institution that does this in? Society the media, right? Okay, so mass media. So when you turn on the TV, when you read a Chinese newspaper, it's presenting a particular worldview. And when you absorb this worldview, you become more Chinese. And what's the last institution that helped us form a collective identity in China? Entertainment, right? Mass culture. This includes TV shows. This includes movies. This includes books. Does that make sense? So through these three institutions, societies can create a natural identity. And depending on your society, you create a different worldview, right? So in America, Americans would want to create an individualistic identity. Whereas in China, we want to create a collectivist identity, OK? So what I will show you today is a quick society, Athenian society was doing the same thing, okay? But it was doing it through theater. And the main function of theater was to create an identity as a democratic citizen, okay? Democratic citizen. Why do we have a democracy? What does it mean to live in democracy? What is your responsibility as a citizen to be in a democracy, okay? So that's what theater does in Athens. So let me give you some background about theater. Theater was the form, the basic structure of Athenian society. So there were two months of the year when everyone went to the theater. Okay, so once in winter and once in the summertime. And they were called the festival of Dionyses. Okay, Dionysus was the god, the great god of the theater, of art, of music, of sex, of wine. And so the festival of Dionysus, there were religious elements to it, but it was mainly about watching theater. And through the process of watching theater, Athenians created a national identity that they all believed in, okay? So this happened twice a year for one month. And it was free for everyone. So it's the rich who paid for all the place to be performed. And that's how the rich, their aristocratic families, won favor from the people. In fact, Athenians considered going to theater the greatest birthright of being an Athenian. That was the privilege and the right of being an Athenian. It was the highest honor in Athens to participate in the festival as a playwright. And every festival, there would be two competitors, okay? And they were called the protagonists, okay? And antagonists. So today, we know that protagonist means the hero of a novel, antagonist means the villain of a novel. But back then, all this meant was you were the first competitor, and then the antagonist was the second competitor. And the entire point of theater was to promote democracy in Athens. And they did that through many mechanisms. First of all, whoever won the festival was decided by popular vote. The entire process of theater was democratic. So there are no professional actors in Athens. People were selected from the community to act out the play. And everyone participated in watching the play. In fact, the largest amphitheater, these are all outdoor theaters in Athens, could hold 10,000 people, 10,000 to 15,000 people. The maximum population of Athens was 50,000 people. So this is a huge community event that brought everyone together. And they loved the theater. The three most famous playwrights and athletes at that time were Ishalis, Sophocles, and Yorbeides. And these were really playwrights, poets, but they were first and foremost profits of democracy. They were teachers of democracy who told the Athenian people, Why do we have democracy? Why is democracy good? And how should we protect and promote our democracy? So in their plays, the very heart and soul of their plays was about the promotion of democracy in Athens. And these three were the most admired of all the playwrights. Everyone at that time wanted to be a playwright because that was the highest honor in Athens. So to win first place at the Festival of Dianesees is like winning the Nobel Prize in Physics today. So what I would do now is go over the most famous plays so we can understand how they promoted democracy through their artwork. But are there any questions so far before I continue? Yes, it's an amphitheater. Okay, so that's a great question about acoustics. We call this acoustics. So how the theater was designed was like this, okay? You have the stage and then the theater was designed like this, like an oval. Okay? So in other words, the sound was captured in like a cavern in a cave. So there was resonance. But obviously you were required to shout out the words slowly so everyone can hear. Okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is these plays were so popular at one memory to lines. You understand? So they already knew the content of the plays, but they wanted to participate in the community aspect of the play. Does that make sense? So the two things is, the theater was designed in a way so that sound traveled very freely in the theater, so everyone can hear, but also everyone memorized the lines anyway. OK? Does that make sense? Great question. All right, any more questions before I continue? All right. So let's talk about Ischelis, okay, because he was really the first of the major playwrights. And he wrote a play called Orsdia. And I will explain to you the plot of the Orsdia before I explain to you the meaning and interpretation of the play. Okay? So all these plays come from Greek mythology. because everyone knows the mythology. And so what the playwrights did was they took material from Greek mythology and packaged it in a contemporary context to explore modern themes. All right. So there is the play set in a place called Argos. And during the Mycenaean period, so this is before the Bronze Age collapsed, Mycenaean Greece, Argos was the most powerful city in Mycenaean Greece. And when the king died, he left the throne to his eldest son named Atreides. But often what happens in these cases is the younger brother refuses to accept the authority of the eldest. And he rebels. So war was fought over the Argos throne. Atreides won. And then his brother comes and begs for forgiveness. And Atreides, being the king, says, You're my brother. I want to show I'm a benevolent king. So I will forgive you and to show that I forgive you, we will, I will host for you a banquet in the feast. Okay. And so the younger brother is very happy about this, but during the feast before the fees, what it really, it really does is he kills all the sons of his younger brother his younger brother and he cooks them and during the feast he feeds it to his younger brother and when his younger brother finds out about this okay he dies after this but before he dies he curses a treatise and says curse upon you and your house because a feast is a contract between you and the gods When you hold a feast, you promise to God this feast will be peaceful. And so people trust you and come and eat your food. So when you poison your food like this, you are in something of God. So I curse you and your entire house. And then he dies. But before he dies, his son, Agitas, escapes. So his only remaining son is Agitas. And the Githis is responsible now for avenging the death of his family. Okay? All right, so a Treetis becomes king. He has two sons who inherit his throne. Okay? The first is Agamemnon, who becomes king of Argos, and he is the king of kings. He is the one who will start the Trojan War and launch an invasion of Troy. Okay? And his brother is Menelos, who becomes king of Sparta. And they both marry sisters, okay? They marry two sisters. Agamemnon marries Platymeshtra, and Menelos marries Helen, okay? This is important because remember Helen runs away to Troy, and Menelos tells his brother, Agamemnon, gets upset and they agree to organize this massive Greek army to invade, destroy Troy and get Helen back, okay? But when they're about to set sail for Troy, there's no win. And Egemenon knows the gods are not happy with them. So Egemenon consults a fortune teller who tells him how to win the favor of the gods. He tells Egemenon, you have to sacrifice your daughter, Iphigenia. And at this point, Egemenon should be like, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna sacrifice my daughter Iphigenia so that I could go to Troy. And why do I want to go to Troy in the first place? Hell is that my wife? It's Mennolos' wife. Not my problem. I should just give this up, because obviously the gods don't want me to go. That's what he should do. But instead, he's like fine, I'll sacrifice my daughter. So he kills his daughter, Evaginia. The wind is released from the skies, and they set sail to Troy. And we know what happens. there for 10 years and it ended up destroying Troy. Who's really pissed now? Who's really angry now? Who's really angry about all this? Claire Mastra, right? The wife of Agamemnon, because their daughter has been killed for like no reason, okay? So Claire Mastra, while Agamemnon is away for 10 years, she plots her revenge. What she does is she finds agitis and they become lovers. Okay? And they plot how to avenge the death of Iphigenia. So 10 years later, when Agathe Menon comes back from Troy, victorious, Chalamestra kills him. Okay? And she makes agitis now king of Argos. The problem is that Agathe Menon has a son named Oristis. And Oristis, during this time, was exiled from Argos. And now Oristis, upon hearing the death of his father, he is now honor bound to kill his mother. Now, obviously he doesn't want to do that. So he's struggling emotionally about what to do. So he consults Apollo, who is basically the God of Justice. And the poet will tell him, you are right and just to want to advance your father. So Oristis goes back to Argos and he kills his mother, Chalamestra, and Agistus. And now he's king of Argos. The problem now is because he's killed his mother, there are these demons called the Furies who come up from the underworld and they begin to haunt him. They're torturing him. And Oris sees, becomes so tortured, he runs away from our goals. And he's trying to run away from the theories, but the theories refuse to let him go. And Oris says to them, I killed my mother in order to avenge my father. That was the right and just thing to do. And the theory say to him, we are all gods. We are responsible for maintaining order and structure in the universe. One thing that you cannot do is kill your parents, especially your mother. By doing so, you are tweaking the order of the universe. Therefore, we will haunt you for the rest of eternity. We will not let you go, okay? Oristis goes talk to Apollo, and Apollo tries to intercede on behalf of Oristis. And the third say to him, you are a young God. You are a new God. We are the old gods. We are much older than you are. We are much wiser than you are. You have no authority over us. We don't care about justice. We don't care about the laws of man. We care about the laws of the universe. And Orissis has broken the laws of the universe, okay? So now Orissis is in a lot of trouble. And so, in an act of desperation, The last thing he does is he runs to Athens where Athena is. And Athena is the goddess of wisdom. So Oristis tells Athena, the goddess, his story, and he begs for her help. And Athena takes pity on Oristis, and she says basically, I'm going to convene a jury of 500 Athenian citizens. And you will tell, you will make your case before them. The Pharisees will make their case before them and they will decide whether or not you're guilty. Okay? So both Oristis and the Pharisees make their case and morally speaking, both cases are compelling. Okay? Right? Because even though Cladimestra killed Agamemnon, the fact of the matter is Agamemnon was an asshole. Right? and on, killed the daughter for no particular reason. And then he went off to Troy and killed a lot of people for no reason as well. So both cases were very strong. And so at the end of the day, 250 Athenians decided a racist who was guilty, 250 decided he was innocent. So it's what we call a hung jury. It was divided evenly. So what then happens now is Athena comes in and says that because you are deadlocked, I will be deciding both. I vote in favor of Aristis. So now Aristis is free to go home and live his life in peace. Now the fairy say to her, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We don't accept your laws, Athena. And then Athena says to them, fine, you guys. I'll make you a deal. Right now, you're a demon and everyone fears and hates you. But I will now make you stand for justice, truth and righteousness so that we, the Athenian people, will worship you and admire you. Okay? And the theories say, okay, that's a pretty good deal. Okay? So the theories accept this deal And Orisis is allowed to go home and the story ends. Does that make sense? So that's a story. So what's the relevance of the story? Well, for Athens, it tells them where democracy comes from. Athenian, Athena the goddess herself, gave democracy to Athens. But it also tells them what a tremendous gift this is. Because by giving the Athenian people democracy, it basically gave them the power of gods, right? Because when you have these 500 jurors, how each of them has the same power and authority of the god Athena herself. Athena can only cast one vote, right? Okay? And so what this is telling the Athenian people is the gods gave you democracy, honor them by taking it very seriously. Okay, when you vote, do so very seriously. Because when you vote in a good way, meaning you've fought very clearly over your decision, then you bring justice, truth, you bring justice and truth and righteousness into the world, okay? Does that make sense? And that's why I say, issue is, it's a profit of democracy. Because through this play, he is telling the Athenian people where democracy come from, what's important, and what they can do to ensure democracy stays in Athens. Any questions so far about this? All right. Okay, let's move on to Sophocles. Sophocles, okay? So Sophocles wrote many plays. His most famous is The Oedipus Trilogy, okay? Oedipus Trilogy. Now, you may have heard of the Oedipus Trilogy, but I will summarize the story for you, okay? So what happened is, in the city of Thebes, a king and his wife, they have a young son. And that's just, it's the custom at that time, they go see a fortune teller. And the fortune teller tells them, your son is going to kill you, the father, and marry the mother. And the king freaks out and he's like, I don't want that. So he tells, he orders his soldier to go out and kill the baby. Okay? And the soldier takes the baby, and again, it's just a baby. Like, you know, maybe a few days, a few weeks old. He goes out into the woods. He goes out into the woods, and he's supposed to kill the baby. But he's a soldier. And he feels it would be dishonorable to kill a baby. So what he does is he just leaves the baby in the woods and runs away, thinking maybe the wolves are coming to eat the baby, okay? Instead, a shepherd from another city comes and finds the baby, and he takes care of the baby. He goes home. In the city, the king and queen have no child, they have no son, they have no heir. So the shepherd presents the baby to the king, and the king names him Oedipus. And Oedipus grows up to be a very strong, very noble, very handsome young man. When he is of age, he goes and talks So fortune teller. And a fortune teller tells him, I am sorry but you are cursed. You are cursed to kill your father and marry your mother. So Edith puts Frick's out and says, I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna kill my parents who love me. So he runs away from his city, okay? And he's going to Thebes. And on the way to Thebes, he gets in an argument with an old man and his friends. He kills all of them, okay? And this old man happens to be his real father, the king of thieves. He goes into thieves and everyone's crying. And Oedipus asks what the problem is. And the citizens there tell him, well, our king is dead and also there's a sphinx, an evil demon who is haunting us, okay? So Oedipus volunteers to challenge the sphinx to a duel. And the sphinx asks Oedipus or riddle. If Oedipus can get it right, the sphinx will go away. But if Oedipus gets it wrong, then the sphinx will eat Oedipus, okay? And the riddle is what walks in the morning with four legs, what walks in the afternoon with two legs, and then what walks in the evening with three legs. And the answer is, yeah, man, okay? So it's a very famous riddle. Edipus gets it right, and the sphinx loses, and he flies away. The people of Thebes are so thankful they make him king of Thebes. If you're king of Thebes, you marry the queen of Thebes. So he's done this. He's married his mother, and he killed his father. 20 years later, there's a plague in Thebes. And Oedipus, now the king, knows that somehow he's angered the gods. So he talks to a fortune teller. The fortune teller tells him, well, the gods are angry at you because you've killed your father and you've married your mother and you've had children of your mother. So all your children are products of incest. So the gods are angry at you. So what Oedipus does is he blinds himself And he exiles himself to die somewhere else. Now the problem now is who inherits the throne? So his eldest son is supposed to inherit the throne, but he has another son named Polyneses, Polyneses who rebels and he fights for the throne. The two brothers kill themselves in battle. They kill themselves, fight each other. And now, Crian, who is the brother to the dead queen, the queen has killed herself. He now inherits the throne. And the first thing he does is announce that the dead king will be given a state funeral. We will honor him. But Paul and Isis, who we belt against the king and who caused all this suffering and misery the world, he will not be given a funeral. He will not be buried. And the reason why is Greeks believe that only by burying the dead can they find peace in the afterlife. So it's a very serious thing not to bury the dead. Integrity, who is the daughter of Oedipus and the sister of Polynesians, she finds out a lot about this and she thinks this is unjust. Polynesians has done a lot of bad things, but no one deserves this, okay? So she secretly buries Polynesians. Crian finds out and demands in technique to be arrested. And Crian says to her, how dare you defy my laws? How dare you disrespect my orders? And then in technique says to him, Your laws are unjust. And Kryan says, the laws are the laws. Without laws, there'll be complete chaos. And then technically respond by saying, human laws must conform to justice. There are these laws in the universe that are divine, unwritten, and immutable. And you must respect these laws. Human laws cannot override these laws of justice. And this makes Kryan very angry. And so he sentenced her to death for disobeying him. The problem is, Antagony is the fiance of Haman, who is Kriyan's son. So Haman, the prince, comes and begs his father to relent. And Haman says, can you please forgive Antagony? And Kriyan thinks his son has betrayed him. Your love for antagonism has blinded you from seeing the truth, from doing what is right. And Heymon responds and says, Father, I'm not doing this for antagonism, I'm doing this for you. And the reason why is the people of Thebes fully support antagonism. They think she is a hero. They think she is just and right to want to bury her brother. they think you are a tyrant father. And then Crian says, should I obey the mob? Should I, the king, listen to the mob? And then Heman says, no, you should listen to what is right and just. Crian gets very angry and kicks Heman out. But then, Crian has a change of heart and he doesn't know if he's done the right thing. So he talks to a fortune teller. And the fortune teller tells him, integrity is right in this situation. You have to save her. If you don't save her, if she dies, the god will be very angry at you. And that scares Qion. So Qion and his guards, they look for integrity. But when they find integrity, she's in the cave and she's dead. She's killed herself because she doesn't want to be executed. And weeping over the body of integrity is Hamon. He's crying. He's so depressed and sad. And Creon sees his son crying and he tries to put his hand on him and console him. The moment that Heman sees his father, he becomes so angry, he lunges at him with his sword. But he misses. And when he finds out he has failed to kill his father in his anger and in his grief, He kills himself. So both Anteagony and Haman are now dead. And when Haman's mother finds out about this, she kills herself too. And now Qion is alone in the world, okay? Doesn't make sense, okay? So does this story make sense to you? All right, now what does this story mean? Well, remember, Athens is a democracy. And so this is a message that's very much anti-king, right? Like let's not have a king because kings do stupid things. Why do kings do stupid things? Because of hubris. A problem with kings, with monarchy, with power is people develop hubris, arrogance, right? Violent, excessive arrogance. And that makes them do stupid things. Like refuse to listen to what is right and good and just. and good and just. That's why kingship is a bad thing. That's why we Athenians have democracy and not a king. Okay, so that's the first message. The second message is basically the world works when the old give way to the young. Okay, the old must always listen to the young. So remember that in the Aristia, the play ends with the theories, the old gods giving way to the new gods who bring justice into the world. The Oedipus trilogy ends in tragedy because the old king refuses to give way to young people. So the other message is society works. There is truth and justice in the world when the old give way to the young. So those are the two main messages of this play. Any questions so far? Before I move on. Oh, that's a great question. Why don't people trust the fortune tellers? Because remember, everyone's religious. So the fortune tellers speak on behalf of the gods. They're called seers or prophets or divinely towards. So their job, what makes them special is they're able to interpret the will of the gods. And that's why the kings listen to them. And remember, for most of human history, humans were extremely religious people, including the Greeks. The Greeks were especially incredibly religious. Does that make sense? All right. OK. Any more questions before I move on? All right. Let's talk about Eurbides. And Ubedes, he's the youngest of these three, and he was the least prized, or the least respected in Athens when he was alive. And the reason why is, as you can see, there are Stia and the Oedipus Rex trilogy. They celebrate Athenian democracy. But Ubedes, he criticized Athenian democracy. So the example is in 415 BCE, and this is the height of the Peloponian War, okay? He put on a play called Children Woman. And this play is about the aftermath of the Children War. So at the end of the Children War, all the children men are killed, right? And the custom is to enslave the Children Woman. So one character is Hecuba. And Hecuba is the queen of Troy. And Priam, her husband, he's been killed, okay? Hecuba is a tragic figure because she's seen all her sons die. And then one of her daughters has been sacrificed, killed for Achilles. Achilles died in the war and Achilles is dead. So they sacrificed a young girl who's a princess of Troy, Hector was daughter in order to accompany him in the afterworld. So either, so all her daughters have either been killed by the Greeks or they've been enslaved, okay? And been forced to be the mistress or cocky-bind of the Greek heroes, like Odysseus, okay? Then you have Ejarmaki. Ejarmaki is the wife of Hector, the Prince of Troy, of Troy who died at the hands of Achilles. So she saw the death of her husband and she has a young baby. And this young baby is only a few months old, but he's a boy. And the law at that time is all boys must be killed because the Greeks fear if he goes up and he's a son of Hector, he might revenge. So, a Jamaaki must witness the Greeks killing her son, who's only, again, only a few months old. And then, Hecuba is dragged away to be a slave, to be basically a mistress, a lover of a Greek general, Odysseus. And so, Hecuba must portionally bury the dead child, okay? child, okay, and so it is a play that made everyone in Athens weep What makes this play powerful is that the year before 416 BCE and this is again during the height of the Peloponnesian War Athens was attacking everyone. Okay, including mellows an island called mellows and when they attacked mellows They killed all the men and enslaved all the women So in many ways, the children woman is a direct response to what happened in Melos. Eurubides is telling the Athenian people, do you see how terrible we are? We are a terrible people. Do you see all the hurt and suffering we brought onto the world because of our empire? Now obviously, the Athenian people didn't like this play, and so he lost in the competition to this obscure nobody, okay? And Eupyrius got really angry about all this. He was very bitter about all this. So he exiled himself to Macedonia, okay? Where he died, okay? He died away from Athens. And his last play, he wrote his last play called a back high in Macedonia. And after he died, his friends brought this play back to Athens. And this play, back high, is considered his masterpiece, his best play. Okay? So again, what I will do now is I will explain to you the plot of the back high, and then I will explain what the interpretation is. Okay? All right. So, there's a god, there's a god named Dionysius. Another name for Dionysius is back-hits, okay? So the back high are people who worship Dionysius, the god of theater, of music, of festivals, of wine, of sex. Now, Dionysus, the legend is he was born in thieves, to a Theban princess. And his father was Zeus, the king of the gods. Zeus likes to go around and rape women. And he has many, many children, including Dionysus. But when the princess of thieves announced that she's been impregnated by Zeus, no one believed her. Everyone laughed at her. And the people of Thieves refused to worship Dionyses. Now Dionyses is worshiped all around the world, including in India, as far as India. So Dionyses has always been bitter about all this. He's bitter about the fact that his mother was insulted by the Thiem people. He's also bitter about the fact that Thiem people don't pay homage to him. So he plots his revenge. What he does is he disguises himself as a wanderer, a stranger, and he makes the woman of thieves insane. He makes them worship him. And what they do is they run off to the mountains where they have sex orgies. They're having sex, they're doing all these crazy things in the worship of Dionyses. The king of thieves, his name is Penteas. Penteas, he hears about this. He hears about all this chaos, and he decides, you know what, I'm going to get my army, go in the mountains and kill everyone, okay? Because the back high are too disruptive. They are amoral, okay? And he's about to do this, but then Dionysus, the wanderer tells him, hey, I'll make you a deal. Don't kill the back high. I want to take you into the mountains and together we can watch them have sex together. We can watch their sex parties. And Pentius says, okay, that's interesting. So together the two go into the mountains and they hide behind a rock as the Bacchai are about to worship Dionysius. Pentius is hiding behind a rock. And he can't really see that clearly, okay? But he's really excited. he really wants to see the back high in action. So Dionysus says, why don't you climb that tree? And that tree will give you a better view of all the action. So Penteas climbs the tree and he hangs by the branch. And he has a very clear view of the back high, who are in a circle. Then what Dionysus does is he lowers the branch. So like Penteas is now in a circle of the woman. And Dainese commands the woman to kill Panties, to rip his body apart, okay? And when the woman in that circle is actually Panties' mother, all right, okay? So Panties dies in the mountains. The people of Thebes are now very anxious. The king has disappeared, the women of Thebes are in the mountains. Then Panties' mother comes back and she's running, she's really excited, okay? And she's holding the head of Penteas. And she's signing to the people of Thebes, look how wonderful I am, look how brave and courageous and strong I am, because I'm holding a lion's head. By my bare hands, with my bare hands, I killed a lion and ripped the head off its body. Here it is, okay? And it takes a very long time for people of Thebes convince her that's not a lion's head man that's your son's head okay so this is an extremely weird play okay very weird and there are different interpretations of what this means and I'll tell you my interpretation right so a think about this image okay a mother holds the son's head in her hand and she's celebrating how brave she is. Now, I think this is a metaphor for war and empire. The reason why is war and empire happens when all people send their children to die, to fight and die for their glory. Does that make sense? So this image of a mother holding her son's head and shutting to the whole world, look how brave I am, look how great I am. It's really a metaphor or an image for war and empire. Because remember, the Pelage Mutant War is really about building empire, right? Athens wants to build its empire and it's sacrificing its young people in order to accomplish this. So the Bacchae is a direct criticism of the Athenian Empire and is direct criticism of the Peloponnesian War. Does that make sense? All right. So some further evidence support this interpretation is in 431 BCE, the Peloponnesian War between Spartan Athens started. And about a year afterwards, a lot of Athenian men are dead. And it is the custom at that time to honor the war dead by holding a huge state funeral. So the state Athens will pay for the burial of all its war dead. During this huge funeral, all I think is come out to watch an oration. And so Pericles, who again, remember, we'll talk more about Pericles later on. But Pericles, he's basically the first citizen of Athens, which basically means he's the king of Athens. And he gives his funeral rations during this time. And the funeral rations is considered by many to be the greatest speech ever made. It is beautiful. It is extremely eloquent. It's very powerful. In the speech, he says this, Athens is the greatest place ever. And that's because we celebrate excellence. Athens is a place where anyone can come and through hard work, through talent, can achieve greatness. We are an open, tolerant, cosmopolitan people. We have a democracy where everyone can participate in the civic life, the political life of Athens. That's why I think Athens is glorious. Therefore, we must protect our democracy through war. through war. It is good that the young go out and fight for our empire, our democracy, because that's what gives meaning to their lives. These men who are dead before us, they died well, because they died protecting Athens and defending our democracy. And we should have all young men go and fight for us. That's a speech. That's literally what he says. So Euripides was probably in the audience, right, because everyone was in the audience when the speech was given. And he reimagines this funeration as the mother holding the son's head and saying to the world, look how brave I am. What Pericles is really saying is we're an empire and empire is so good because it brings glory to the old people. And so the young must protect the glory of the old people by dying in a war. Does that make sense? But if you think about it, even though your pretty is criticizing Athenian democracy, What he's really doing is also trying to defend ethnic democracy. Because, ethnic democracy only happens when citizens are engaged in a process of argumentation, debate, and self-reflection. And so, what Uribe's is really trying to do is put a mirror before the ethnic people and he's saying to the ethnic people, look how awful we are. We can do better. And that's what a democracy really is. It's an open and honest discussion about how we can be better. And again, these three, Ischelis, Sophocles, and Eurbides, are considered the three greatest playwrights in Athenian history. And these plays are actually still performed today. Okay? So there are Stia, Oedipus Rex, and the Bacchai are still performed in theaters around the world today. That's how amazing they were. So any questions? Oh, OK, great question. So the back high, how do other scholars interpret the back high? So there are different interpretations. But the most common interpretation is it is a play that explores the idea of religious yield, religious devotion, or religious fanaticism. Does that make sense? That's the most common interpretation. This play is really about the power of religion and faith and how it drives us into madness. Okay, that's the most common interpretation. Another interpretation is, well, Dionysius is the villain, okay? He's not really a villain, but he's the main focus of this play. And Dionysus does a lot of bad things, right? Well, guess what? For most of his life, Euripides was participating in the festival of Dionysus hoping to win first place, right? To be the protagonist, to win first place. But most of the times he lost because he kept on offending the Indian people, right? So another interpretation is this play, Bacchai, it's a satire on the power of Dionysus and of theater in general, okay? It's a direct criticism of the festival of Dionysus. And what Yubin is really saying is the festival of Dionysus, it's not about art and reflection and democracy. It's really just a wild sex party that's trying to please everyone, okay? So you can also interpret this as a direct criticism of democracy itself. Democracy is just a wild sex party. So these are the two major interpretations that the back eye, it's about the power and dangers of religious devotion, fanaticism. And also the play back eye, it's a direct attack on the idea of theater itself and democracy. But I don't see it that way. I think the most likely explanation for me is it is a direct criticism of empire. And you can believe whatever you want. And that's the power of Athenian theater. There are different ways to interpret it, okay? So even today modern audiences are still amazed and inspired by these plays. Any more questions then? Great, good question, okay, so revenge. Okay, you're right, in that all these plays have the idea of revenge. And the reason why is, if you think about human motivation, what really drives us? What really drives us to violence? What's revenge? So revenge is the main plot device we use to drive action. It's what motivates us to do violent things. And that's why throughout all these plays, revenge is a common theme. But another very common theme is the idea of hubris. Right? Hubris. Errogance. And this is what the Greek playwrights focus a lot on. What they discovered is things go awry in society when the leaders, when they lead, when the kings, they develop hubris. OK? Because it leads to bad judgment. But what they also discovered is hubris is just a part of human nature. If you put someone in position of power, he or she will always stop hubris. So hubris is basically the most common theme throughout all these plays. And you're right, revenge is also a very common theme as well. So yeah, there are these common themes. But the reason why is these playwrights, these poets, they're trying to explore what it means to be human. They're trying to decipher the essence of being human. They're trying to look into the human heart and trying to figure out what makes us human basically. And all humans are alike, okay? Any more questions? Yeah, the Athenians, okay. So the thing about Euripides was that we today, Today scholars will all agree all these three UPDs was the most talented, meaning his use of poetry, his use of metaphors, imagery, it was the most imaginative. We also agree that he is the most shocking. His ideas, the way he presents things, it is the most visual and imaginative. So in terms of pure talent, he's the most talented. But when he was alive, he was extremely arrogant person who believed theater should be about awakening people, should be a challenging people's sense of reality. It should be about education and edification. And these people tend to be hated by contemporaries. But after the dead, later generations respect them more. So even though a children woman did not win first place, the back high did win first place. And that's because while UbiD was dead, and they were able to see the genius and imagination of the back high much more closely. Does that make sense? So UPD's basically had his image, his reputation, was rejuvenated after his death. But during his lifetime, he was despised by a lot of people. People respected his genius, but they didn't like the fact that he was so arrogant and candid. And that's true for most of human history, where if you are a controversial writer, You are not respected by contemporaries, but after you're dead, people appreciate your genius. And this is true for most really famous writers. Any more questions? These are great questions, by the way. OK, great. So next class, we will do Socrates and Plato, OK?"}
{"video_id": "AEPSUC-UQ5k", "title": "Geo-Strategy #9:  Putin's War for the Soul of Russia", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEPSUC-UQ5k", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 3933.511, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 7484, "text": "So this week, Vladimir Putin, in a speech, said to his Russian people that all of Russia must now prepare for total war. Even if you are not fighting on the front lines in Ukraine, pretend you are. And because of the speech, there are many analysts who believe that Putin is preparing Russia for total war. And total war means that every aspect of your society is geared towards winning a war. And so we last had total war in World War II, okay? But not after that. So why is Putin doing this? Now there are some people who believe that it's because Russia is not doing so well in Ukraine. They lack manpower and so they need to mobilize society to fully win the war in Ukraine. Okay? And the explanation is that Putin knows that NATO is preparing to send reinforcements to Ukraine. that because of last summer's offensive, Ukraine is desperately short of manpower. Okay, the average age of their soldiers right now is over 40. They have men in their 60s who are fighting in the front lines. Emmanuel Macron of France has publicly stated that he is considering sending French troops to Ukraine. The British themselves are thinking of conscription, drafting all young men into the army. The Americans, American politicians have said that they're considering a new law that would give citizenship to illegal immigrants who join the army, okay? So it seems like NATO is only going to escalate the war in Ukraine. And so Russia's preparing for that. One more explanation, one more possibility is that Putin wants to expand the war, okay? So he knows he's winning in Ukraine, and he's thinking about attacking Modova and possibly the Baltic states, okay? These are all possibilities. Today, this morning, what I wanna do is argue another possibility, which is that Putin is mobilizing his society because he sees war as a tool, as a mechanism to radically reshape the people in Russia. And so think of a metaphor, okay? You're fat and you're like, okay, how do I get fit? How do I get trim, right? You go to the gym and you work out. And for Putin, that's what war is. War is a workout for your society. When you enter war, you become a much more disciplined, unify and prosper society. Okay, so that's what I wanna argue today. Okay, so why does Putin think like this? Well, let's look at the current state of Russia. Russia in many aspects is a broken society, corruption. Russia is the most corrupt society in all of Europe. The rich people steal and then they run off to Europe or the United States or Dubai. So corruption is a huge problem in Russia. And because of corruption, the GDP of Russia is very low. So South Korea, which has about a third of the population of Russia, has a higher GDP. The state of Texas, just one state in the United States, has a higher GDP than Russia. So Russia, in many respects, is a very poor country. Second problem is alcoholism. One out of every six Russian males, about 16, 17% of the population, they're alcoholics. It's a disease. They have the disease of alcoholism. One out of every three deaths in Russia is because of drinking too much. And because of alcoholism, the rate of young men dying Rate of young men dying is just increasing and increasing. Okay? The third problem is fertility so right now the fertility rate in Russia is 1.5 that is below the replacement level right remember that the replacement level for Society is 2.1 Russia is 1.5 the problem you have a lot of men dying because of alcoholism. Okay, so since the year 2000 The population in Russia has been declining declining steadily. And all this means is that if current trends continue, then Russia will cease to exist as a society. Okay, the nation will die. So why is this happening? Well, okay, the Western explanation is that, this is happening because Russia is not democratic, right? If you have full democracy and you unleash the human potential of your people, then Russia will prosper. But Putin, Vladimir Putin, has a different explanation. Okay? His explanation is that this is happening to Russia, okay? Corruption, alcoholism, and low fertility. Because Russians have been lied to, deceived, and manipulated by Western civilization. Western civilization preaches the gospel of liberal democracy, of freedom, of human rights, of consumerism, and these are all lies, they're hypocrisies that have fooled the Russian people and have corrupted the Russian soul and destroyed Russian civilization. And because Russians are abandoning their soul, their civilization, their nation, this is why this is happening. Does that make sense? That is Putin's argument. So why does Putin believe this? Well, in the late 80s, the Soviet Union had basically lost the Cold War. And they lost the Cold War because their elite basically gave up. They no longer believed in communism. They didn't believe in self-sacrifice for the nation. They thought that Western values, the Western lifestyle was much better, okay? So they gave up. In the late 80s, there was an American historian. He actually works for the American State Department. His name is Francis Fukuyama. And he wrote an extremely influential essay called The End of History. End of History, okay? with a quotation mark. And he argued that the Soviet Union failed and America became trumpet, because liberal democracy is the best idea to have ever been invented. And to make his argument, he uses the philosopher Frederick Hegel, okay? Now, Frederick Hegel had something called the theory of the dialectic. dialectic. And what Hegel argued is that history is determined by a war of ideas. The purpose of history is determined by the movement of ideas. And how ideas work is that they have a pattern called the dialectic. Okay? So there's a thesis, a A new idea comes into being. But then we recognize that this idea has problems. It's too extreme. It's too problematic. So we create an antipasist. But this antipasist itself is also too extreme. And this creates also problems. So then what happens is the theses and antipasists come together and create a more moderate, more efficient idea called the synthesis. And this is how history moves or progresses. And so Fukui Yamate takes this idea and says, OK, well, this explains what's happening today, where at first you have a thesis called capitalism. Capitalism. And this created the Industrial Revolution. And because capitalism was too extreme, we moved towards communism. communism was created to counteract the extremes of capitalism. But communism itself is too extreme, so then we move towards the middle, which is the right idea, which is called liberal democracy. So what is liberal democracy? Well, at the core of liberal democracy is the idea of consumerism. And the idea of consumerism is that we exist to buy things. And as long as we buy things, there'll be world peace. Why? Because consumers have a need to buy, and therefore, nations have a need to produce. And nations produce the best when they're trading together, as opposed to warring against each other. So this is the argument that Francis Fukuyama makes in the end of history. I want to explain this argument further, okay? What's he really saying? Okay, so from human history, all societies have struggled with one problem, which is how do we optimize the workforce? How do we get each and every person to work as hard as possible for our society? And if everyone did that, then our society would be strong, united, and prosperous. So that's a fundamental problem of politics. How do you optimize workforce participation? And traditionally or historically, there have been three answers. The first is war. The second is religion. And the third is salization. Now, as you can understand, these three things work because they give structure, meaning, and purpose to our lives. Okay? And we have structure, meaning, and purpose. We are much more motivated to work hard. But as you can also see, there are actually lots of problems with all three, right? War is to kill people. That's bad. Religion is superstitious. Okay, but civilization itself is also problematic because the logical extreme of civilization is Racism, okay Which is to say that we Russians are better than everyone else. We Chinese are better than everyone else Therefore we can do it whatever we want. Okay, and this naturally leads to in parallelism right We have a duty to go conquer other people to civilize them right something called the white men's burden and This leads to fascism. Okay? Okay, war and conquests are the ultimate good so historically war religion and civilization have given people Structurement and purpose, but they create a lot of problems. They create suffering and war and pain, okay So, but over time what has happened is that all of them over time have become much more abstract. And the reason why they become more abstract is in order to increase the population, in order to create mass aside. So let me give you an example of this. The earliest religions in humanity have been polytheistic. And the gods themselves were very much like humans. Think of the Greeks, Zeus, Athena, Hera. It was a polytheistic society, and they were very much like humans. But over time, this polytheism became monotheistic, and it became abstract. The idea of God was so much removed from us. And the benefit of that is that you can have more people believing in one God. And it motivates you to work harder, OK? Because it's just an abstract concept. And because of abstraction, we develop new ideas. For example, money, OK? So rather than have war, religion, and civilization as the structure and center of society, want to make money the structure of your society. And this is what we call capitalism. And capitalism, of course, led to the industrial revolution, industrialism. Capitalism meant that societies were becoming wealthier and wealthier, more industrialized. Does that make sense? But there's a problem with capitalism. What's a problem with making capital or money at the very heart of your society? Exactly, okay? So the first major problem with capitalism is it's all-consuming. So as Jack says, all capitalism cares about is the expansion and growth of capital, regardless of its effect on society, okay? Profit for the sake of growing profit. It's an all-consuming idea, which can ultimately lead to destruction of the planet, okay? That's the first problem. What's another problem with capitalism? Or the idea of having money as the heart and center of your society? Anyone? Okay. So what this means is that money likes to consolidate itself, okay? Consolidating, okay? Meaning that, so the example is, let's just say that each of us had a million dollars, right? What's the fastest way for us to grow our money? If we put it together, right? And then we can go invest it. So in other words, if you just like capitalism do whatever it wants to infinity, what happens is that you exactly have one person with all the money. Does that make sense? Because that's the fastest way to grow money by consolidating it. So that's problematic. What else is wrong with capitalism or money? So another problem is the idea of alienating or dehumanizing. What does this mean? Capital alienates and dehumanizes. What does that mean? Exactly, okay. You as a person cease to be human. To be a human is to be a complex, multifaceted individual who likes to create and love. But in capitalism, your only, your production value, your only, the amount of money in your bank account, okay, does that make sense? All right, so for all these reasons, capitalism is really bad. There are actually more reasons, okay? So Karl Marx, and his Communist Manifesto, points out all these problems of capitalism, and he proposes a solution, which is, okay, rather than make money at the heart and center of your industrial society, make the worker the heart and center of your society. OK? So he makes this argument. But what's very revolutionary or prescient about his argument is this is a natural cycle. OK? This is part of the Hegel cycle, where capitalism comes along and communism will be the natural evolution of capitalism. OK? Why? OK. OK. So let's do the thought experiment. OK? Let's do this slide experiment where your parents have died, and now you're working in a factory in order to survive. How do you feel about this? Your parents have died, does anyone support you? So at age 16, 17, 18, you have to go off to a factory to make money for yourself. So how do you feel about this? Are you happy about this? How do you feel? Depressing and and lonely and yeah, exactly. You're bitter and you're depressed. Okay. You're alienated. So then what do you do? Then what do you do? What can you do now? You're bitter, you're angry, you're depressed, you're lonely. So what do you do? Okay. You start to think about why this is the case, right? You start to have a political consciousness. Okay. What Marx calls political consciousness. From this alienation of the worker, workers will start to develop a pull of a consciousness. They're like, why is this happening? Why is the government abandoning me? Why has society abandoned me? What can I do about this? Then what happens? That's exactly right. You want change, and how do you enact change? Yes. You spread your ideas and you organize. When you organize, what do you realize? Yeah, you what you recognize when you when you start to organize is the capitalist needs you to do the work Right the capitalist owned the capital and the factories, but you're the one who's actually doing the real work So about well you the factories can't run. So it's only say united You can enact whatever political demands you want. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, so for Marx This is just a natural evolution of capitalism. Capitalism leads to the alienation of the working class, which will lead to their political consciousness, which will lead to their solidarity, which will lead to a political revolution. And so you can make the worker as the heart and center of your society. Okay? Doesn't make sense, guys. All right? Now, what's amazing about Marx is that today we say he's wrong, right? Communism happened in the Soviet Union and happened in China, but it didn't happen in Europe and in the United States, where Marx said it would happen first because Germany was more industrialized than Russia or China. Does that make sense? That's what we say. If you think about it deeply, Marx was right. After World War II, every society, every industrial society, to some extent, adopted the ideals of communism. It doesn't make sense. We call this socialism and our communism, but basically it adhered to the thinking of Marx, which is to make the worker the heart and center of your society. And why did they do that after World War II? Exactly, okay? Because workers create value. Money doesn't create any value. Money just creates more money. It's speculated. But the workers create value. They're productive. And therefore, you have to treat your workers properly. So in America and in Europe, workers became the heart and center of your society. And the workers for unions could demand political reforms. And so all society was geared towards making the lives of the middle class, the working class better, okay? That's why you had accent healthcare. Great public schools, cheap universities, okay? So the 50s and 60s and 70s was basically the peak of society for the working class. But in the 80s, we start to change this, why? Why would we wanna change this system? It's a great system, right? Marx is right, having the worker as the heart and center of your society, as the central organizing unit of society makes a lot more sense than having money as the heart and center, okay? But starting in the 80s, we start to go back to money, Why? Excuse me? Who wants more? Yes, exactly. So what happened in the 80s is something called the revolt of the elite. In other words, a problem with having a society based on a worker is it becomes too egalitarian, too equal. But if you're like the elite, you don't want equality. You want difference. You want to have power and money in your hands. Does that make sense? So the revolting elite happened in the 80s. And this is what we call in the United States the Reagan revolution, okay? The Reagan revolution. The beginning of neoliberalism, free market capitalism. And in Britain it was called thatcherism, okay? Market thatcher, the thatcher revolution. And so now you need to transition away from the worker to something else, okay? another ideology that allows the elite to amass power. So just to show you how radical this revolution was, in the 1970s, if you were a CEO, the head of a company, you were making on average one million US dollars a year. That's pretty good, right? That's really good money. And that one million dollars was more than 20 times the worker. Okay? And that's pretty reasonable. Today, the average CEO in the United States makes $20 million a year. And that is 200 to 300 times more than the average worker in the company. It doesn't make sense? So in the 80s, inequalities, inequality start to explode. And so they were transitioning from the worker to a new organizing unit called the consumer. So they needed to destroy the working class, the middle class. And the way they did it was by introducing a new concept called the consumer. So in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, the government promised you a good job. If you were a member of a society, if you were a citizen, I promise you a good job that you would have for the rest of your life. So in the 80s, the government said, I promise you that you have low prices and a wide selection of goods. Does that make sense? So this sounds like a subtle shift going from the worker to the consumer. What this meant was a revolution in society, a revolution in politics. So remember that, for example, the worker, the worker has to have political consciousness in order to protect his or her rights, in order to organize and unify and push for favorable political reforms. That's what the worker must do. But now let's think about the mentality of the consumer. And to do this, let's do another thought experiment. And the thought experiment is this. Everyone in the school, about 500 people, I decide to give everyone one million US dollars. So everyone in the school has exactly one million US dollars to spend. What happens now? Think about this, what happens now? Use your imagination. What happens? What's the first thing you do? What's the first thing you do? I've given you a million dollars. What do you do with it? Well, the first thing you do is buy something, right? What do you want to buy? A $1 million is a lot of money. What do you want to buy, NAP? You buy a house, right? That's great, that's a great purchase. Then what do you do? Then what do you do? Okay, first thing is NAP buys a house, then what does he do? To me? Buy furniture, then what does he do? There's something that he must do that's very important. What does he buy the house? What does he want to do? He wants to take pictures and post on social media. Right? So everyone sees it on social media. Then you see this. Now it has this huge house in Beijing with lots of fancy furniture. What do you do now? You also want to buy a house. But what kind of house? A bigger house, right? And then what do you do? You also post pictures, OK? Then how do other people feel? You think this is funny, OK? But this happens all the time. So very quickly what happens in the school? And yeah, you all spend your money and you all go into debt, right? Because you're in competition with each other to buy the biggest thing. And one million dollars is a lot of money, but it's not enough to buy everything, right? So you go into debt, you borrow more money to buy more things, and then what happens? And then what happens? How do you guys feel about each other? Do you guys have lunch together? Do you guys have dinner together? do you guys like to share homework together? You guys hate each other, right? At the end of the day, what will happen is you all go into debt and you all hate each other, right? So that's consumerism. This is what consumerism is. Consumerism creates a competition in society for prestige, okay? To see who can pose the nicest social media pictures. This leads to the indivision or the optimization of you. In other words, you are now unable to act together. You don't want to organize, you don't want to act in solidarity. And ultimately, this means that you develop economic logic. And what is economic logic? It's to see the world only through the lens of capital. of capital, okay, does it make sense? So when you see someone and you're like, okay, well, do I wanna date this person? You don't ask, oh, is this person a nice person? You ask yourself, how much money does this person have? Okay, you understand? You use economic logic in order to understand the world and to reason and analyze the world, okay? Now let me ask you this question. Today, is this how China works? Is this how the world works? The answer is yes, okay? Are you like this? Yes, you are like this, okay? You've been brainwashed into thinking that this is the only way to behave and to think. You're in school, why are you in school? So you're gonna get a job, why? To make money, so you can buy things, okay? You understand, that's how you all think. But there are different ways to think about school. You're like, I'm in school to learn, to open my mind, to have an imagination, to think critically about the world. Now it's a way we thought about school when the workers were dominant. But now that consumers are dominant, all we think about is, how do I get a good job? How do I buy a bigger house? Because I want to post it on social media. So if you think about this, what this really is, is the perfection of slavery. Does it make sense? What does this phrase mean? The perfection of slavery. Yeah, you become the slave of the money, but what? Why is this perfect? Yes, okay? You understand? If you're a slave, you rebel, right? But you don't know you're a slave, and you like this. You choose this, then you will never rebel, okay? So the consumerism is the perfection of slavery. Okay, and that's why Francis Pukoyama thinks that consumerism is the end of History because it is a system that achieves what the elites want and the masses are Unwilling and unable to protest and rebel. It doesn't make sense. It's a perfect system okay, so But there are certain civilizations that rebel against slavery intrinsically. It is in a nature to rebel against slavery. And one of these civilizations is the Russian civilization. So when you impose slavery on Russians, they become corrupt, they become alcoholics, and they refuse to have babies. That is why Russia is failing as a society, because slavery is being opposed on Russians by the Westerners and the Russians refuse to be slaves. But because the system of consumerism is so perfect, Russian people lack a understanding of how to rebel against the system and that's why Russia is falling apart. That is a Putin argument. Does that make sense? In other words, consumerism has corrupted the Russian soul Russians have chosen to be corrupted by consumerism. So does it make sense? So what Vladimir Putin must do is free his people, even though they may enjoy prison. Even though Russians may enjoy slavery, Putin is still gonna free his people. He's gonna do it by creating a new concept to combat consumerism. Okay? So we've gotten from the worker to the consumer, and Putin is going to introduce a new concept called the warrior. The consumer is a person, an individual, who acts alone, and does so to preserve his or her life. Okay? The consumer is a coward. The consumer lacks imagination. The consumer is alienated. The warrior is different. The warrior is an individual who sees that through his actions, he or she can shape the direction of history. I can make my own reality through my courage and through my imagination and by acting with others. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so let's do another thought experiment to understand the warrior concept. Let's just say that, okay, in this school, I gave everyone a million dollars and now you hate each other, okay? Then what happens is I put you on a plane, and I take you all to an island, okay? And you're on this island, and unfortunately on this island, there are millions and millions of flesh-eating monkeys. They want to eat you, okay? But you hate each other. You don't want to work together. What happens now? What happens now? Yeah, that's right. If you don't do anything, everyone gets eaten by a monkey, right? But what are you gonna do? How you will fight the monkeys, how will you fight the monkeys? Okay, what's gonna happen is that everyone is gonna put aside the differences and work together to fight the monkeys, okay? And how you feel in this process. Are you happy or depressed? You're gonna be happy, why? Exactly, you're all working towards the same goal, okay? Structure, meaning, and purpose, okay? That's what war does. War gives you structure, meaning, and purpose, so you feel happy about yourself. Now, just say that during this war, like Celine dies. Now what happens? What does death do now? Yeah? Yes. And so Celine dies. She goes to martyr. You all celebrate her. Remember her. You give her a great funeral. And then what do you do? You fight harder. Do you understand? Because the death gives you purpose. Her death makes your life much more valuable to you and to you others, okay? Not only do you celebrate her life, but you celebrate your own life, okay? All right, now let's just say that the monkeys are coming, okay, and there's a bridge, there's a bridge, and Jack is standing on this bridge, and there are 10 of you on the other side, okay? So Jack has a choice. He can either cut the bridge and kill himself and save the others, or he can run and possibly all get killed by the monkeys. What does Jack do? For sure he will do this. What will he do? He's gonna sacrifice himself, okay, do you understand? We've seen this one war over and over. Okay, that's what war does to people. It makes you, it gives you structure, meaning and purpose. that makes you a stronger, more disciplined person. Does that make sense? So that's the thought experiment. So in theory then, when Putin launched this military operation, it's called a special military operation in Ukraine back in February 2022, then we should see improvements in Russian society. Does that make sense? So what's happened in Russia since this war? Are people happier? Do you think people are happier? Do you think people are happier now? Okay, I think they are. Do you think people are more unified? I think they are, okay? So one example of this is the Russian economy is surviving US sanctions. In fact, it's getting stronger and stronger. Why? Because people are fully participating in the economy now, okay? So an example of this is that every month, Russia is producing 150,000 ammunition cells for the war. Every month, Russia is producing more ammunition cells, shells for the war, 150,000. Can you guys guess how much the United States produce every month in comparison? Guess, guess the number. To me, 100,000, 2000, okay? You understand? So Russia is gearing towards a war economy. It's factories are producing more and more weapons. But that means more and more people are employed, which means that they're drinking less, okay? When you have structure and meaning and purpose in your society, all this goes down. Okay, corruption goes down, alcoholism goes down. Oh, sorry, fertility goes up. All right, does that make sense? So last year, Putin made the statement. He was asked, okay, you have a lot of Russians dying on the battlefield. And he said, well, when they die on the battlefield, we honor them. They sacrifice themselves for their country. They're always remembered as heroes. Their families will always love them. But if we just let them do whatever they want, All they're gonna do is drink themselves to death. Okay, you understand? So what Putin is saying is that what war is, ultimately, it is a mechanism for society to rejuvenate itself. Okay? What war is, it's an opportunity for society to cut away the fat, to make itself more lean. So for Putin, this war, it's not really about conquering Ukraine or defending against NATO. It's really about saving Russian civilization. It's really about saving the Russian soul. Okay? Because you don't fight this war and you let these trends continue, then Russia will eventually cease to exist as a nation. Doesn't make sense. Okay? So what's gonna happen is that over time, A new concept will arise to challenge consumerism and liberal democracy. And we will call this concept Putinism. And the idea of Putinism is really continuous war. That as a society, you should be constantly fighting wars in order to discipline, unify your nation. And make your people stronger and more prosperous. That is Puddinism. And I think this will be his defining legacy. And Puddinism is a direct response to liberal democracy. So we will shift as a society from one that is based on the consumer to one that is based on the warrior. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions? Oh, so Selina asked a question, how is capitalism different from liberal democracy? That's a great question, okay? So capitalism is only concerned about capital, okay? So you can be a fascist country and be capitalistic. So capitalism, many people will say leads to fascism. So Nazis were extremely capitalistic. They see communism, the Soviet Union, as a direct threat to its existence, okay? that they have a liberal democracy is the participation of everyone in the generation of capital. Does it make sense? So in other words, and this is one of the ironies of the 20th century is that capitalism and democracy are opposing forces. And the idea of liberal democracy is to put the two together in a synthesis as to explain a way or ignore the contradictions, okay? but capitalism and democracy are contradictions. Does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? So, Jack makes a great point, which is like wars that have been fought before have destroyed societies, okay? So think of Athens and Sparta and think of World War II and World War I, okay? Society's become exhausted and destroyed. So, the idea of continuous war is you fight small-scale wars so as to manage the size of the conflict. And it's important to do that. Why? Why don't you want a large-scale war? No, no, no, no. What might happen in a large-scale war? That's right. The problem is you have nuclear weapons in place now. So it's not smart to fight a large-scale war. But when you fight a large-scale war, you can't really control the escalation. And eventually, say the United States and Russia to fight a ground war in Europe, eventually they'll be so angry at each other they might have to use nuclear weapons. That's why one of the major tenets of Puddingism is you pick small contained conflicts. So Ukraine is a small contained conflict. And the invasion of France or an invasion of Britain would lead to nuclear war, doesn't make sense. And that's why the United States would also pick Iran because Iran would be a small contained conflict. Does that make sense? Okay, so this is the Puddinism, okay? War is a mechanism to transform your society, whereas before, we understood war as a mechanism to conquer others, okay? As imperialism or the spreading of civilization. Now, the idea of Puddinism is, no, guys, we don't care about the other people, we care about ourselves. We're using war as basically a mechanism to discipline our bodies, just like the gym. Okay, does that make sense? Okay? The thing about global leaders, world leaders is they're all insane, but they're not stupid. You understand? There's a difference. They're happy to kill millions of people. They're not happy to blow up the world. Okay? But Jack's other point is that Russia is not a very wealthy country. Eventually you're going to exhaust yourself. And that's why we think war is usually a pyramid scheme. And what that means is, so the example is Nazi Germany. When they were fighting these wars, it was costing their economy a lot of money, so they were forced to fight even more wars. That's what eventually led to Germany's invasion of Russia, because they needed the resources and the manpower. And that's the same thing that will happen here, where, OK, Putin is spending a lot of money to fight this war in Ukraine. But after he finishes war in Ukraine, then he needs to go call for more territory for their resources. So in the long term, this could lead to disaster. This could lead to a large-scale war. But in the short term, it does work. Does that make sense? Any more questions? OK. So Selena asks a great question, which is like, eventually people are going to get exhausted. And what Putin believes is that the Russians are a warrior culture. Russians enjoy war. Russians are good at war. So Russians won't be exhausted by war. They'll be galvanized and energized by war. That's a theory, okay? And he's right. There are warrior cultures out there around the world that do enjoy fighting, okay? So you think of the German people, right? The Germans have been fighting wars for 1000 years and they've been really good at it, okay? You think of Japanese, okay? Japan is also a war culture that enjoys fighting wars. China is not a war culture. It's very hard to get Chinese to fight wars. And Chinese, except, OK, I hate to say this, but China would probably lose more to wars. It's not a war culture. So for Chinese civilization, war would be exhausting. But for Russian civilization, war can be energizing and rejuvenating. Does that make sense? It depends on your civilization. Any more questions? Okay, so What's gonna happen and the answer is that? Water culture works right now Okay, because where culture beats consumer culture easily So you see the one Ukraine where Russians are destroying the Ukrainians and the Europeans are like I'm too busy watching TV. I'm too busy buying things. I'm too busy vacationing, okay? So consumers don't want to go to war, okay? But eventually Russia is going to reach a point where it directly threatens Germany and France and Britain and then they will start to transition into a war culture, okay? So Puddinism will become the dominant ideology for the next 50 years, but Putinism can spread to other countries. So Japan can adopt Putinism, Germany can adopt it, Britain can adopt it. And so the world we call, so when this happens, we call this world multipolar. So the word we use is multipolar, or multipolarity. Meaning that there are different centers of power throughout the world. Right now, there's only United States, it's a global hegemon. But over the next 10, 20 years, we expect a multipolar world where each region has different hegemon. Okay, does that make sense? All right, any more questions? Okay, so what happens to the United States? So next week we'll discuss the United States, okay? But what I will show you is that if the United States fights us more in Iran, what it has to do is retreat back to its borders, okay? And that's become isolationist. But I'll explain that to you next week, okay? Any more questions? Sorry, sorry. Go ahead. Okay, so that's a great question, okay? So we just said that consumer culture is the perfection of slavery, but it's worker culture slavery. And you can make the argument that it's actually anti-slavery. Why? Why? What can the worker do that the consumer cannot do? What's the problem with having a worker culture really? See me? No, what can workers do that the consumers would never do? Guys, workers can rebel, right? Wars can mutiny. Their army can be like, you guys are terrible. We're going to rebel against you. You understand? Does that make sense to you? Because you always don't do that. Because it was like, hm, I'm going to rebel. I'm going to stop buying things. You know what's going to do that? You'll never be like, I'm going to stop buying things, because I think it's bad for the environment. You won't do that. Whereas, wars like, you know what? I don't like this leader. Let's march to Moscow and get rid of him. They can do that. And they do that all the time. That's why war culture is so destructive. And that's why war culture was so dominant before and then we got rid of it. Because for political leaders, war culture is a direct threat. Does that make sense? OK. So when in this question, this reveals a contradiction in Putinism. What is the ultimate problem in Putin turning his entire country into a war society? What's the problem with that? And it's a huge problem for Russia. And this is why ultimately Russia will not triumph in a multipolar world. In fact, it'll probably fall apart. Why? For a world culture to triumph, what does it need? World's by best when what? When there's a king, guys. When there's a king. That's why we have kings, right? So what's the problem with Putin's Russia? What's gonna happen to Russia? Guys, eventually Putin's gonna die. You understand? Eventually he's gonna die, and then what's gonna happen? The country's gonna fall apart, this is a war culture, and you have these different generals fighting each other for total control. It's gonna be civil war, okay? Putin right now is a strategic genius, he's the king, everyone admires him, so he unites everyone, and he can direct all society into total war. When he dies, this society's gonna fall apart, okay? That's why Putin's legacy will not be a strong Russia, it'll be Putinism, okay? the idea of continuous war. Russia may not survive without Putin. And quite honestly, we have a great leader like Putin. It's impossible to replace him. No one would have his genius and authority and ruthlessness. Does that make sense? All right, David, you have another question? So David asked a great question. How much of society agrees with Putin? And the answer is, most people don't like to go to war. Most people are scared by war. But ultimately, society is determined by those who are willing to act on their beliefs. So when we looked at America, look, the issue of lobby, they're only a small fraction of the American population, like less than 1%. But because they're willing to act and they're organized and they're determined, they get their way. Does that make sense? Same thing in Russia where at most, okay, I would say at most you have 10% who are like, oh, Putinism is a great idea. Let's go conquer the world, okay? At most you have 10%. Most people are like, we want peace. We want to live our lives. I have children. I want my children to be safe. I don't want to send my children to war, okay? But again, history is determined by those who are determined to act in unison. So it's usually the most extreme individuals who get their way. Does that make sense? But thanks for the question. Any more questions? Okay, so Putin believes that Russia is first and foremost a great civilization. But as a great civilization, it also has to fight wars to protect itself. You understand? So Putin's like, you know what? If America left us alone, we would not fight wars. It's only because America insists on encircling us, insists on trying to destroy our culture, our civilization, that we must fight a war. Does that make sense? And so what people say is, listen, the war in Ukraine, It's ultimately caused by NATO encroachment into Russia. So NATO, after the Soviet Union fell, expanded five times. Guys, NATO was set up as a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union. Well, if you don't have a Soviet Union, you don't need NATO anymore. So why is NATO expanding? In fact, NATO was going to expand into Ukraine. So Putin is like, we are fighting this war ultimately defend our civilization. That's what matters, the defense of our civilization. And if it requires us to go to war, then we'll do so. And it's just this process that will create Putinism or continuous war. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Yeah? Okay, so even though only 10% agree with Putinism, I actually don't know the real number. but I think it's only a minority. What happens is that in war, people become much more unified. Okay, so the example is Ukraine, where actually about 50% of the people in Ukraine were Russian speakers, okay? And there was a large group of people, at least a third, who were sympathetic towards Russia. But the moment that Putin invaded, They're all united under Zelensky, okay? So that's what war does, war unifies people. So again, back to the island example, you guys may hate each other when you land on the island, but hey, if there's a million flesh eating monkeys that wanna kill you, you guys are going to become a family. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? Is this clear to you guys? Okay? You look at, so you wanna ask a question. Are you confused by something, Celine? Excuse me? Okay, so again, Russia is a warrior culture. It enjoys war, it's good at fighting wars, okay? But China is not a warrior culture. And the reason why is that throughout most of China's history, China was the dominant power, the hegemon, okay? Also, China is surrounded by natural defensive, right? So to the east you have the sea, to the south and to the west you have mountains, to the north you have the Great Wall. So China doesn't feel threatened by anyone and therefore it doesn't have a war culture. Does that make sense? But Russia is a huge country that's been invaded multiple times. And all these invasions were traumatic for Russia. So you look at the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, that killed 20 million people. Millions of Russians died in that war, and people still celebrate that war. So China is not a rare culture. Does that make sense? Any more questions? So what we will do next week is, We'll talk about Putin's strategic genius, okay? And what I will show you, and this will be interesting, is that the way that Russians see the world is roughly different from the way we see the world, okay? So we'll discuss Putin's strategy moving forward next class, okay? Does that make sense? All right, good."}

Today we do China. Obviously, we are in China and we know a lot of Chinese history, so I will go fairly quickly and deeply. This is an opportunity for us to look back on the theories we've developed over the course of this year and really think about how they apply to the Chinese context. It's a chance for us to see if our models work. If they do work then they would be true in the Western context and also in the Chinese context. It's also a chance for us to deeply interrogate our theories and see where flaws might arise. Okay so I'll be going through some Chinese history but I will do so by applying the theories we've learned so far, mainly the oceanic currents of history. All right, so let's get started. Today we're going to look at a question that is fundamental to China, which is, we know that for the longest time, China really was the civilization's par excellence in the world. It gave us all the great inventions that would make modernity possible, including the compass, paper, printmaking, gunpowder. But after Song Dynasty, which is about the year 1200, China stopped being creative. And so why did this happen? And that is the question that will frame our discussion this morning. All right, let's go over some quick Chinese history. So Chinese civilization, as you know, developed along the Yellow River. The Yellow River is perfect for agriculture. And as a result, population expanded very quickly. When that happens, conflict and war will ensue. And that's what will give rise to settlements and fortified cities that will drive the development of the state and civilization and technology. The hallmark of China civilization is what we call the warring states period, Chunqiu. And at this time, the foundations of Chinese civilization will come into being. At this time, you will have something called the hundred schools of thought. Confucianism will develop, as will Taoism and Legalism, okay? And these ideas will form the foundation of Chinese civilization. And as you can see, in this period, all these hundred schools of thought developed because of a process we call open cooperative competition, which as we have discussed, is the main driver of innovation in human civilization. Okay, openness means that there is no centralized authority. Cooperation means that even though there's no centralized authority, the different states are trading, communicating with each other, and they are intermarrying into each other. And competition means that there is a lot of conflict between them. They are warring against each other for dominance in their region. And in this process, this will give rise to the ideas, the technology, the values, the culture that will underpin Chinese civilization for the next 2000 years. Confucius is obviously who is best remembered from this era, but you also have Lao Zi, who is the founder of Taoism, okay? As well as Zhuang Zi and Mo Zi. Sun Zi will at this time write his book, The Art of War. So in a process that is open, cooperative competition, eventually one state will emerge to conquer the rest. And as we discussed, why the state emerges is because of three things. Energy, they're much more energetic, they're much more ambitious. Second is openness, they're much more willing to adopt innovation in the ruthless pursuit of military conquest. And they are opportunistic, meaning that they will do whatever it takes to win. So in this period, the state that will eventually conquer all China and create the first empire is the Qing. And again, if you think about it, in the year 500 BCE, we could not possibly predict that the Qing would conquer and unite all of China. Because of all these states, the Qing was the porous. It was situated in the mountains, whereas the other states are situated in these fertile valleys. Its culture was not developed as the rest, and its population was smaller. So we couldn't predict that the Qing would eventually unite all of China. By the same time, near 500, we cannot have predicted that Rome would unite the Mediterranean and we cannot have predicted that Macedonia would have united the Greek world. Alright, so let's discuss very quickly why the Qing was able to succeed. Okay, even though this is the warring states period and there's a lot of warfare going on, what What we need to remember is that this warfare is heavily regulated. War in this period, it's almost like an aristocratic game. So there are stories where this general was laying siege to a city and the people inside were starving to death, which is what you do in a siege, right? You starve the population to death. So the general felt tremendous regret and guilt for putting the population under such misery. So he retreated and withdrew to give time for the population to recover. And that was considered what was gentlemanly, okay? That was what was considered chivalrous, civilized back then. Another story is that an army was crossing the river, which is a great time to attack them. But they're posing an army, let them cross the river, because that is what is civilized, what is gentlemanly. So this period was heavily regulated by a gentleman's code of conduct. And then you ask yourself, why is that the case? And the answer is that, remember, this is an open cooperative competition environment in which, even though these states are at war, they still a lot of intermarriage between them. There's still a lot of trade, a lot of communication. So these states are not trying to use warfare to overturn the social order because they benefit from the status quo. They're using warfare as a means to maintain the social order. And that's why warfare is extremely heavily regulated. And so let's think about the Peloponian war between Athens and Sparta. When we look at the war, we know that the Peloponnes war was extremely bloody, it was extremely deadly, but at the same time, it was extremely regulated. And a lot of their strategies didn't really make any sense. It was really about defeating the enemy. So for example, we know that in Sparta, there are people called the Helots who are basically slaves to the Spartan people. The Helots outnumber the Spartans 10 to one. So all Athens had to do was say to the hellots, if you fight for us, if you revolt against your masters, we will grant you freedom. That's all Athens had to do. But Athens never did that, because by doing that, you would disrupt the social order from which Athens benefited, and you unleash a revolution that could possibly engulf the entire Greek world. Also, even though Sparta and Athens were enemies, They were united by intermarriage among their elites. They had a similar culture. And they historically were allies, especially against the Persians. So warfare at this time was about maintaining the status quo rather than overturning the status quo. And this presents an opportunity for the Qing dynasty, which is in the margins of the status quo. So the Qing dynasty started to implement warfare in a way that opportunistically took advantage of the status quo situation. And they commit themselves to total warfare, meaning their entire society was engineered in a way to allow them to win against their enemies. So certain characteristics about the Qing dynasty at this time, first is the idea of legalism. draconian laws that force a population to behave in a certain way. Something that is very fundamental, the idea of legalism, is collective responsibility. And what that means is that if you commit a crime, you'll be punished, but so will your entire family, okay? The idea of collective responsibility is pioneering at this time in order to maintain a very strict society that can be purpose for war. Okay, so that's the first thing. Legalism. Second thing is the idea of centralization, meaning that you have a bureaucracy, you have centralization, okay? And this allows you to actually expand very quickly. It allows you to expand and govern new territories that you conquer. And the third, of course, is total war, meaning like you devote all your resources to warfare in order to conquer your enemies. The Qing dynasty was also known for its openness. So if you were a man of talent, and you could contribute to the military and the bureaucracy, they would welcome you. So think of the Qing as a revolutionary system that sought to overturn the status quo. And the other states like Wei, Zhao, Han, and Zhu, especially Zhu, they were trying to maintain a status quo. And therefore they were not that well equipped to deal with a challenge from the Qing. Okay? Now we know that the Qing would unite all of China. And but because their system was so draconian, eventually the other states would rebel against them. And this would eventually lead to the Han dynasty. Now the Han dynasty is actually, well even though the Han dynasty disparages the Qing, so our very conception of the Qing comes from Han historians who tell us that the Qing buried scholars and they burned books. And that in our eyes is barbaric. We don't know that's true. We know that the Qing practice had resendent ship, so those hundred schools of thought, a lot of these books were censored and destroyed during this period, but we don't know for a fact that they buried scholars, okay? But this is what, so the Han dynasty is trying to disparage, trying to refute the Qing dynasty. That said, the Han dynasty continues the system first introduced by the Qing, okay? Qing, okay? The Han is really at this point the height of Chinese civilization. There's a confluence, there's an arrogance to the Han. And one of the top priorities for the Han is now that they've united China, they have to deal with the northern steps people, okay? Remember that throughout history, the steps people have proven to be the most daunting challenge for civilizations. They are extremely, they're ferocious warriors and the step people will eventually give rise to the mongols. At this point, the main adversary of the Han are called the Shownu people. And the Han dynasty is committed to a policy of eradication against the Shownu. Okay, and this policy of eradication will force the Shownu to migrate westwards And eventually, these people will start to even threaten Rome itself. Attila Han, the Han people, are descendants of the Xiongnu. But over time, because of this conflict between the Han and the northern steppe people, this will create tremendous strain on the Han. And eventually, the policy will evolve to one of cooperation and dependency. And so what will happen is there'll be a lot of trade. There'll be a lot of intermarriage. And the step people will be hired as mercenaries for internal conflicts within China. Open qualifier competition now switches Mahan, which has become a centralized power, to the step people. So within these people, and there's quite a lot of different tribes, there will be now tremendous competition. And one group, one tribe that will eventually triumph is called the Shanbei. Okay? And the Shanbei will give rise to which dynasty? Do you guys know? Okay, but Shanbei will give rise to which major Chinese dynasty? You guys should know this. What comes after that, the Han? The Tang Dynasty. Okay? So this is one thing that is misunderstood. The Han dynasty is really the last Chinese dynasty. It is the last ethnically Chinese dynasty committed to the protection and propagation of Chinese culture. The Tang dynasty, the founders, the Li family, they're actually of the Shandei tribe, okay? And as a result, they will switch from a, they will switch China into a universal multicultural empire. The Tang Dynasty is famous for being extremely open, tolerant, and inclusive. Okay? All right? So this is the Tang Dynasty, which is considered the height of power, a height of Chinese power in the world. The Tang Dynasty will try to expand westwards into Central Asia, and it will start the Silk Road and trade networks all around the world. Buddhism, at this point, will come into China, and it will become at certain points a state religion. Okay? But there are many problems with the Tang Dynasty. So there's a heavy reliance on generals to fight wars. And this will eventually lead to the An Lushan Rebellion, okay, which lasts for almost 10 years. An Lushan is the top general of the Tang Dynasty. And because he's given too much power, he has too much independence, he's much too trusted by the emperor, he eventually rebels and seeks the throne for himself. This rebellion will kill anywhere between a third to half of the Tong population. 60 million to 30 million people. And this is devastating and traumatic for the Tong dynasty. But somehow it recovers. But then you will have another rebellion called the Huang Chao rebellion, which will end the Tang Dynasty. I'll talk about the Huang Chao later on. The Tang Dynasty will give rise to the Song Dynasty. And the Song Dynasty will adopt a policy of diplomacy, tribute, assimilation with the northern tribes. They're trying to avoid the trap of the Tang, where you give too much power to general and the general will rebel. So a lot of power in the Song Dynasty, a lot of power will be invested in the imperial bureaucracy. That's the Song. Eventually, a Song empire will be carved up and conquered. Eventually, the ultimate winners of this war will be the Mongols, who in the year 1279 conquers the entirety of the Song Empire and unites China. Okay? But the Mongols are considered a foreign dynasty. So I mentioned that the Tang dynasty is actually non-Chinese. But the Mongols understood themselves to be non-Chinese and as a result they discriminated against Chinese people, which ultimately led to rebellion that will establish the Ming Empire. And eventually the Ming Empire will give way to the Qing Empire. The Manchus are just another iteration of the Mongol people. They will rule China until 1911 when the empire is overthrown, a republic is established, and this gives way to, of course, the people's republic of China, okay? So the big question again what we're looking at is, why is it that the Song dynasty is the last creative dynasty? And if we use the idea of open cooperative competition, then we know the answer. And the answer is this. Previous dynasties were not able to exert national control. They were always competing against other states within China proper. So you look at the Han dynasty. Well, the Han dynasty would give way to dozens of other states that would compete against each other. So in theory, the Qing and the Han united China, but not for long. And the same is true for the Tang as well. China for the longest time was just too large, too diverse, to be unified centrally. And as a result, the idea of open cooperative competition would still give rise to innovation. But, starting at the time of the Song, we see a radical change. Look at the Song, okay? The Song is pretty united. And the Yuan is extremely united. So the Yuan dynasty is able to unite all of China. And then after the Yuan dynasty, the Ming is also pretty united and the Qing is extremely united. Okay? So in other words, the answer is this. After the Song and starting with the Yuan, China became nationally unified. And it was able, the center was able to exert control of the provinces in a way that was not true before in Chinese history. Okay, so the idea of open competitive competition died with the Song dynasty, and that's why. the song trying to stop being creative. Okay? So that's the answer. But then this gives rise to another question which is how was China able to create national unity? All right. So to answer this question I want to refer to the work of of Professor Wang Yuhua. He is a professor of Chinese history at Harvard. And he wrote a new book called The Rise and Fall of Imperial China. And it's a wonderful book. If you're interested in Chinese history, I strongly recommend that you look at this book. All right. So he begins the book by asking a central question. And the central question is this. We know that the Tang dynasty was with a height of Chinese power. It had about a quarter of the world's GDP. And it influenced the cultures of Korea, Japan. And it's extremely diverse, inclusive, multicultural empire that introduced Buddhism to China. But the problem with the tongue is their emperors didn't really live that long. Five emperors, at least five emperors during the Tang Dynasty were deposed by the elite. The aristocracy got together and were through the emperor, usually by killing him, okay? So this is the Tang Dynasty. But when you look at the Qing, Qing only had 5% of the world's GDP and it was wrapped by internal rebellions like the Taiping rebellion. And it was far behind internals of science technology to Europe. But the emperors like Tianlong, they could rule for 60 years peacefully. Okay? They transitioned into a throne peacefully and they died peacefully. So the Qing, even though it marked a low point in Chinese prosperity, the emperors lived for a long time, which meant that the bureaucracy, the center, was really stable. This is a paradox. Why is it that when China is wealthy, the emperor is weak, but when the emperor is strong, China is poor? That's a paradox that Professor Wang Yuhua is trying to answer in his book. He used to love social science, analysis, and research for his book. So first of all, what he does is he analyzes the probability as an emperor that you are deposed by the elite. And it turns out that the tongue was really the height, but then when you get to the song, the probability decreases significantly. But at the same time, what we need to understand is even though the emperor lived longer, the state's ability to collect taxes, to control the economy, decreased over time. So you can see that starting the year zero, all the way down, there's a downward slope. Now, this is not straight down, okay? There are peaks, right? So you go down, then you go up, you go down. The up is when a new dynasty starts. And so at this time, the new dynasty is run by a very strong leader. Like for example, Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming dynasty, the founder of the Ming dynasty, okay? These are extremely capable leaders and they are supported by really talented bureaucrats. And at this point, they're able to collect a lot of taxes, which strengthens the center. But over time, the trend is fairly clear. Starting at the time of this Song, You see a steep decline in the state's ability to collect taxes. The only exceptions are around the year 1600 when the Ming transitions to the Qing. And so what Professor Wang Yi-Hua has discovered is the reason why you have this transition is the emperor starting around the time of the Song, He's actually figured out a way to divide and conquer the elite. So the elite, when they are united, they're able to promote strong centralized policies that promote national growth. But the centralized elite can always threaten the emperor, who is dependent on the elite for their support in the military and in government. Starting around the Song, the centralized elite is now broken down into localized elite. So the trick that China has discovered in maintaining a strong center is by localizing the elite. So the idea is you localize the elites. When you localize the elites, you can implement a policy we call divide and conquer. So you get the elites in this province to fight amongst themselves. If they're too busy fighting amongst themselves, they're not going to ever rebel against you. And they're not going to build alliances with other provinces to ever challenge you. And their priorities and focus is in the provinces. And they really don't care what you guys do in the capital. So that's the thesis. And what Professor Wang Yu-hua says is the main mechanism that the emperor used in order to achieve this radical cultural shift is the Kheju. The Kheju is a civil service examination that promoted bureaucrats into business of power, the Kheju, the civil service examination. And so the issue of the Kheju is that it was introduced briefly in a sway, And then the Tang dynasty started to use it. But it was really the Song dynasty that really systemized and promoted it. Basically, the Song dynasty institutionalized the Khedju. And before the Khedju, it was really an aristocratic system where you had to be a noble berth in order to become a high official in government, which is true for most cultures. So that's what he argues. All right, so he looks at times of major rebellions. And what he shows is that whenever there's massive climate change, you have violence erupt, okay? Because when you have a centralized system, what often happens is that the nobility engage in rent-seeking behavior. Basically, they exploit the peasants. And that's fine if the weather is good. When the weather is bad and peasants don't have enough to eat, then they often rebel. And in the tongue, this would culminate in something called the Huang Chao rebellion, which would last for 10 years. When a salt merchant named Huang Chao, he would lead an uprising that would overwhelm and destroy the tongue dynasty. The thing that's important for us to remember is that he would go all the way to Chang'an. And Chang'an is where all the elite live. There are about 200 aristocratic families in the Tang Dynasty, and they were all killed in this rebellion. When we moved to aristocracy, this gives the Song Dynasty room to implement a new policy and ensure that an ability cannot arise again. So that is the significance of the Huangchao rebellion. it eliminated the idea of aristocracy in China. Okay, so Professor Wang Yu-hua, he looks, what he does is he shows you how networks work in China. So during the Tang Dynasty, as you can see, there are centers which then moved to the provinces, okay? So these families are all interconnected together because there's only 200 aristocratic families. If you are a wealthy family in a province, what you want to do is intermarry into one of these aerosolatic families, because that's the best way to ensure your advantage and privilege in life. Okay, so this is during the Tang Dynasty when families are united nationally. But when you get to the Song Dynasty, what you will see is that the center has been localized, meaning it's been spread out. And what you also see is that these networks are localized. They're not connected together now nationally. All right? And this again allows now the emperor to divide and conquer. All right? So let's just do a comparison of the tongue and the song. As you can see, what's really important is, look at this guys, the networks become more and more localized over time. It is the deliberate policy of the imperial bureaucracy to localize elite networks so that they can never unite and challenge the center. So these networks are becoming much more fractured and localized over time. So the main benefit of the system is of course national unity. So again, during the Han, you have all these different provinces that form their own dynasties and which challenge a center. So China was in a constant process of war. The Tang dynasty was a bit better, but when you get to the Song, the Yuan, the Ming, and the Qing, it's all pretty unified nationally. By localizing elites, you ensure the center can be challenged and as a result, you give a semblance of national unity. But the problem with this, as we know, is it comes at the cost of innovation, which will make China insular, poor, and divided in the long term. And it's not really a sustainable system, okay? But that's a system that China has chosen to adopt for the past thousand years, right? A divided and conquered policy against the local elites. All right, so let's look at another example of how China became insular, poor and divided over time. So this is a map of the top 30 cities by population throughout Chinese history. As you can see during the Western Han Dynasty, most of these cities are centered around the Huanghe, the Yellow River, okay? That makes sense because that's where Chinese civilization began. But starting with the tongue, they're starting to spread out more. And by the time of the song, they're actually congregating to the coast, right? So why is this happening? It's happening because of maritime trade initiated by the Abbasic Caliphate. Remember our last class, we learned about the Islamic Golden Age and how the Abbasic Caliphate became so wealthy that it established trade networks all around the world. And these trade networks are so powerful that they could influence the national economic development of China, okay? And we can expect that because of maritime trade, over time, all the major cities of China would all shift to the coast. And that's why when Zhu Yuanzhang came into power, he initiated a policy of close borders. He shut down maritime trade because he was afraid that if this continued, then all the power would be located in the coastal areas, and therefore the north, the west, the south will become much poorer, and therefore they are much more incentivized to rebel. Also, the coastal areas would have so much power that they could ultimately depose him, okay? And that's why Zhu Yanjiang would impose a policy of maritime trade ban. And this would make China much more insular and weak and poor. Okay? So again, remember back to the Islamic Golden Age when the Islamic world united all the entire world and tried to pull China into its system. But because of that, it was causing wealth inequality in China. And that's why the Ming dynasty will shut down the trade network. Not completely, but mostly, okay? That's why you see how this massive Chinese immigration to Southeast Asia, because they wanna maintain these trade networks. And there's a trade ban enforced in the Ming dynasty. And the Qing dynasty will continue this policy as well. For China, the priority is internal stability rather than wealth and prosperity, okay? All right, so that's a quick introduction. All right, any questions about this so far? Are you guys clear? Any questions? You guys are clear, right? Okay, all right, so that is Professor Wang Yi-Hua's argument and as you can see, it's, he backs up with a lot of data, okay? I'm just presenting to you his argument. Okay, so now I wanna talk more about the idea of the imperial bureaucracy, because this will inform and help us better understand world history as we move along, okay? So to better understand the rise of the imperial bureaucracy, let's first reexamine the history of Rome, okay? So in year 500 BCE, Rome became a republic. And Rome, the republic, will become the model for the British Empire, as well as the American Republic. So it's very important that you fully understand the Rome idea of republic. So, Republic is, again, a society governed by laws, tradition, and history, okay? And these three things are manifested in the nobility. Okay? What the Romans call patricians, patricians. And the patricians will exercise power for something called the Senate. And it's this very idea that Rome is ultimately a culture of republic governed by law, tradition, and history is what will allow it to expand very quickly until it dominate the entire Mediterranean. These petitions are the ones who will establish these international networks that will make the Roman Republic coherent, okay? And they will do so through the idea of a patron-client relationship. So the idea is you have a patriarch, and then the patriarch has clients. And this will expand across the entire Mediterranean. So in other words, the emperor is just one among equals. The emperor has his empire, but these patriarchs have their own empires within the empire. Okay? And this gives Rome, even though it's very spread out, a coherence and a unity that most empires don't have. And again, this is important for us because the British will copy this model when they build their empire. Okay? As well as the Americans. The problem with this system though is that If the patriarchs don't like the emperor, the patriarchs can get together and depose the emperor, which has happened a lot of times throughout the history of the Roman Republic. So think of Julius Caesar, right? Julius Caesar wanted more power for himself, and so the patriarchs got together and killed him. But Julius Caesar was just one of many. There was also Caligula, Nero, and a lot more emperors, okay? So because of this, new emperors, but especially people like Diocletian, Diocletian was a military general who won the Roman Civil War and so became emperor. They had to fix this problem, okay? Because obviously your emperor, your biggest problem is how do you stay alive? And in the Roman Republic, the chances of you staying alive aren't very high, okay? So starting with Diocletian, they start to develop an imperial bureaucracy. to counter the power of the nobility. The problem though is that the nobility solves three problems for you, like the proxy cannot solve. The first is a problem of the will to fight. The second is unity. The third is culture. So the will to fight means that in a war, the nobility are those who are the most to lose, and therefore they're the most willing to die. So think about the year 216 when Hannibal invaded Italian peninsula, and he had destroyed all the women armies. At this point, Rome should have surrendered, but nobility refused to surrender because if they surrendered, then Hannibal would have instituted changes to their culture, that would have destroyed the prestige, power, and wealth of nobility. That's why the nobility refused to surrender. They fought to the very bitter end, and eventually they were able to triumph over Carthage. So the will to fight, the nobility gives a society the will to fight. Second, of course, is unity, national unity. And the third is culture. So the people who wrote the history of Rome were actually the nobility, the senators, the aristocrats. So when you get rid of nobility, you lose these three things. You lose the idea of a national unity, a national identity. You lose culture, you lose the will to fight. And that's why for the longest time, the system stayed in place. Because to reject nobility, to kill all the nobility, would be to destroy the tradition, culture, and history of Rome. But Diocletian would try to solve this problem by implementing imperial bureaucracy. But the imperial bureaucracy could not challenge the authority, power, and legitimacy of nobility. That's why Constantine would in 330 move the capital to Byzantium and create the Byzantine Empire. And as we discussed previously, the Byzantine Empire, folk had imperial bureaucracy, and it was the dominant power. And so the Byzantine Empire is not a continuation of the Roman Empire, it is a rejection of the Roman Republic. So does that make sense? The history of Rome. Okay, this is important for us because the same thing will happen in China. The same thing will happen in China. After the Tang Dynasty, the Song Dynasty will look at the mistakes of the Tang Dynasty, and they will start to implement the Keju system and create an imperial bureaucracy that will rule China for the next thousand years. So the Keju. There is a great misconception in China that the kujoo is a meritocracy. But it is not a meritocracy. It was never designed to be a meritocracy. I know that in school you are taught that they have the kujoo in order for the emperor to select the best and brightest in China. And because of the best and brightest, they will rule China virtually. That's what you've been taught in school. That is not correct. That's not what the kujoo is designed for. The kujoo is designed for the emperor to localize the elites and to divide and conquer them, okay? So let me explain why it's not a meritocracy. First thing, first thing about Ablikujo that's important for us is that there's a quota system in place, okay? So if it was just a meritocracy, then the very best and brightest would win out, right? But think about the Gao-Kao, okay? If it was just a meritocracy, then who would get into like the top universe in China? I assure you that 90% of all the top students we come from two cities, right? Beijing and Shanghai, right? But that's not how the system works. There is a quarter system in place, there's geographic distribution. Only certain number of students from Beijing and Shanghai can get into Beijing and Tsinghua, the rest come from the provinces, okay? And the Kujiu is the same system. So let's look at it very quickly. You have the center, everyone's trying to get into the center. Let's say you have province A, B, C and D. And all the same, you have 10, Wolfe families, okay? You have 10,000 poor families, okay peasants. How this system works is, A will send two, D will send two, B will send two, C will send two, okay? And when you do it this way, this creates competition among the local elites, right? To win these positions. And therefore they will fight amongst themselves. Does that make sense? If you don't do it this way, if it's just the best and brightest, then what will happen is like A, B, C, D, and will compete amongst themselves, and eventually one of the provinces, like maybe B, will develop the innovation in order for their children to always finish first or place a top in the kuzhu, okay? Does that make sense, guys? All right? So it's not meritocracy, it's a quarter system. That's the first thing. Second thing you need to understand is that it is unfair. Why is it unfair? Well, because in order to do well on the kujoo, remember the kujoo is testing your knowledge of something called wen yen, okay? Or classical Chinese, classical literary Chinese. Okay, this is a very hard skill to learn. It will take you decades. You will need prior tutoring. Your family needs to have a lot of money. You need to spend decades on this project, which means that you have a lot of leisure time. You don't have to work. Okay? So in other words, only the elite families of China can compete in the system, and that's the point. Okay? The point is to concentrate the ambition and energy of the elite families into the kudzu. Otherwise they might come up with ideas like rebellion. Okay? They also might come up with new inventions and amazing literature, but they'll also probably think of ways to rebel. That's why you want to concentrate their energies on the kudzu. Does that make sense? The third thing that's really important for us to remember is that this system is discretionary. What does that mean? It means that just because you finish first on the kudzu does not mean you become a government official. Did you guys understand? Success on the kudzu does not translate into success in politics. It is discretionary, meaning the emperor gets to decide who becomes an official and who gets promoted, only the emperor. All right? And often what will happen is the emperor will start to promote maybe someone from the poor families. Okay? So not poor, but lower nobility. And the reason why you wanna do that is to create a precarious situation in the provinces where no family feels secure enough you feel as though they're the nobility. You wanna create conflict and precariousness in the provinces that might un-conquer and therefore you can exert greater control over the provinces. But by doing that, you limit economic growth. You limit cultural innovation. Does that make sense guys? All right. So what this means is the bureaucracy is able to control China because of its monopoly, it has monopoly over three aspects. The first is status. So if you want to be admired, if you wanna be respected in China, you do well and it could you and you become an official. That's a dream of every family in China. It's still true today, where the dream of every Chinese family is for you guys to get into an Ivy League school or take the Gaokao and go to Peking or Qinghua, okay? The idea of status is still associated with the Kujou. Even though we know that success on the Kujou and success on the Gaokao does not necessarily necessarily translate into success in school or in life, okay? That's the first thing. The second is the Monopoly over Literacy, okay? Monopoly over literacy. What I mean by that is this. In most cultures, your goal is to make literacy more widespread. Which when you do that, you allow for faster economic development. So throughout history, all cultures have tried to figure out how to make literacy more widespread, more prevalent. So let's look at an example of Egypt. Egypt. Egypt has been around for as long as China. And over centuries, they would make their language a lot easier to understand. So in the beginning, they had helicalithics. So maybe the sun, this represents sun, this is moon. So that's the first stage. They have pictograms to represent ideas. Then what they would do is make these symbols shorter, okay? So that's, it's easier to remember. And then what they would do is they would make these symbols phonological, meaning they don't represent ideas, they represent sounds, okay? So this now becomes the English word monsoon, right? Does that make sense? And then what they would do is they would take the sound, sorry, take the word and make it into just one consonant. So this would become S, this would become M. And therefore, you now have the word, English word sum. And that's where we have the alphabet because of this evolution of language in Egypt. It was the Egyptians who developed this system and then the Greeks stole it through the Phoenicians. Alright? So most cultures follow this pattern because now it's easier for people to become literate, which just drives economic growth, okay? China is the only culture in human history that has made literacy more difficult over time. China took the pictograms and made them even more complex and added these very complex grammatical rules to the language and created something called literary Chinese. Literary Chinese, but that's a nice euphemism. That's a nice way of saying it. Really what it is is bureaucrat-tat, bureaucrates. Bercrat-t is a language that only bureaucrats can understand. So think of contracts, right? When you look at legal contracts, you can't read it, why? Because the language, the grammar, is designed so that only as a specialized lawyer could you understand the contract, right? And this is what we call rent-seeking behavior. You create something that only you can use and people have to pay rent in order to access your knowledge, right? So literacy, the problem with literacy will keep China back from developing. And the third is culture, okay? Culture. And what I mean culture, I really mean Confucianism. So Confucianism is really a bureaucratic philosophy system designed to maintain the status quo, to control how people think about the world. All right? So remember in the Confucian religion, What matters first and foremost is balance harmony. There's also a concept called ancestor worship. So you can't leave your village because if you leave your village, you can no longer worship your ancestors. You can't clean their graves. And so people are just stuck in place. Not limit trade and innovation in China. So the could you, sorry, the bureaucracy, the empirical bureaucracy was able to maintain monopoly over status, literacy, and culture through three mechanisms. The Kujiu, Wen Yan, literary Chinese, and Confucianism. Okay? And that stopped the development of, that stopped the cultural and economic development of China. Okay. So let's better understand this idea. Okay. In a society, there are There are different ways to seek success and status. So you have the Barakas, of course, and that's the way people do it in China. But you also have the military. You also have nobility, joint nobility. You also have church, religion, by becoming a priest, by becoming a spiritual leader. You also have merchants, commerce. You can also do it through artistic endeavors. So these are the main ways people achieve status in society. And in most societies, you have these different systems in place. What is unique about China is the dominance of the bureaucracy. So the nobility was wiped out. And for the kudzu, the kudzu ensures that no nobility can arise again in China. Okay? Church religion was outlawed for most of Chinese history. Okay? The merchant and the artistic people are low status in China. So go back to the Confucian system, the scholar fishes at the top, then you have the farmers, then you have the merchants, and you have the artists, right? So the Confucian religion puts the merchants and the artist at the very bottom. And this is intentional because the artist, okay, they can promote new ideas, but the merchants are even more problematic because they trade, okay, and they can accumulate wealth. And that wealth can challenge the authority of the empire. So the merchants are a problem. The military, as we know, was heavily suppressed throughout Chinese history, okay? So the Song dynasty, there was these massive conflicts between the military and the bureaucracy. The military wanted to go fight and defend Song territory. The bureaucracy wanted to just bribe everyone, okay? All right? Okay, so, and because you have too much power within the bureaucracy, this was stunt development in China. All right, let's look at one more example, okay? We know that by the time of the song, China had four major inventions. Okay? These four major inventions, of course, are paper, printmaking, compass, and gunpowder. All right? And these four inventions, guys, will revolutionize the world. All right? So if you look at paper, it will give rise to back notes. Okay? So the stone had back notes, and this will give rise to capitalism in the West. Printmaking is important because remember, in the 15th century, Gutenberg created something called the printing press in Europe. And because of the printing press, you're now able to manufacture books at scale. And when you do that, what happens is that people become more literate, okay? So the very idea of the printing press made available all these books, all this knowledge that wasn't available before. And now people could just learn how to read and write. So this will give rise to literacy. And when you give rise to literacy, you will give rise to things like the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the sign of revolution, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution. So this marked a revolution in European affairs. The compass will allow for the age of exploration. So these Europeans are able to discover new lands and conquer and colonize them. So North America, South America will eventually all become colonized by the Europeans using the compass. Gunpower is important because it is a revolution in warfare. From gunpower, you will have things like a cannon and also eventually the musket. The musket is just an individual gun. And this marks a revolution not only in warfare, but also in human affairs. Because when you're the musket, now individual soldiers do matter. Before it was a knight who was the main weapon in a warfare. But now we have a musket, you can now equal the playing field. It's more important to have more soldiers then they'll have knights. And this will allow for things like the American Revolution. When you have these farmers with muskets, they were able to overthrow the British Empire. It will give rise to the French Revolution when you have citizens who are not professional soldiers that able to take these muskets and defend their country against a European invasion. So all these are major revolutions that will give rise to modernity. And again, China by the Song dynasty, 1200 CE, had all four inventions. But because of the culture in place, because of the bureaucratic culture in place, neither, not any of these inventions have an impact on China society. So they did nothing whatsoever with all four inventions. So the key lesson here, guys, and this is really important, technology does not matter. You can steal the technology. What matters is the culture. Another example of course is the Yuan Dynasty. When the Yuan Dynasty, during the Yuan Dynasty, China was importing a lot of foreign experts, a lot of foreign bureaucrats, Christians, Muslims, Jews. They were importing a lot of foreign technology. And then when the Ming power, when the Ming empire came into place, they got rid of all this stuff. They got rid of the foreigners, they got rid of the technology, China became much more insular and backward. Okay, so that explains why after Song Dynasty, China did not innovate anymore because the empire did not want to innovate. Innovation is a threat to the status quo. And what's important is to maintain the status quo. Even though by doing so, Ultimately, you make China poor, weak, and divided. All right, good, any questions? Does it make sense to you guys? Does this conform to your understanding of Chinese history? Yeah, okay, so the question is, is Confucianism a religion or a culture? So no one thinks Confucianism is a religion. At most people will say that Confucianism is a civic religion or philosophy. All right, so I would say that confusionism, ultimately, what it is, is bureaucratism. I can't even spell bureaucrat anymore. Bureaucratism. What I mean by that is that it is something that's designed to make everyone believe that a bureaucratic society is the best society. It is one that is the most sophisticated. And it's designed in order to maintain a status quo, where bureaucrats are at the top, okay? That's what confusion really is. So the example is that if you try to reach Chinese history, the most virtuous people are always bureaucrats, scholar officials, right? And this propaganda is so effective that eventually Europeans will stop, what will start to mimic this propaganda. So Voltaire, the French Enlightenment thinker, says that Chinese have the best system because they allow only educated to rule, not soldiers, not priests, but scholars officials, manduins, okay? So the idea of Confucianism is that it's bureaucratism. It's designed to legitimize and give authority to the bureaucratic elite, right? So thank you. Does that make sense to you? Okay, any more questions? So I'm gonna end the class with a story, okay? And the story has to do with the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yanjiang. So Zhu Yanjiang, he is now emperor and he reinstitutes the Keju, okay? The Mongols got rid of the Keju because they had nobility. But Zhu Yanjiang, he restores the Keju. Never was excited, okay? So everyone comes and takes the examination. When the results come out, what happens is that the test-takers from the south do a lot better from the north. So these northern test-takers feel there must be corruption in place. So they file a petition to the emperor. The emperor looks at the petition and he agrees there must be corruption. How is that no northerner was able to pass the kuju? So he calls in his chief minister and he says, this is a huge scandal. I want you to resolve this issue, okay? Figure out who's responsible for this corruption and kill them, all right? So the chief minister, he really wants to impress the emperor. So he spends months painstakingly, rigorously examining the issue, investigating the issue. He has commission, he has hundreds of staff. He personally looks at every single kuju. And then he writes his report, he presents it to the emperor, okay? And he says to the emperor, Your Majesty, I personally have done this investigation and we have written like thousands of pages of report directly to you. I can guarantee you the kuju when implemented was a fear, open and transparent process. The fact of the matter is that people in the South, they're more civilized, they're more culture, they're more educated, and therefore, they just did better on the, they did better than the Northeiners. And I'm really sorry this happened, but I guarantee you that could you is a fair, open and transparent process, you have nothing to worry about. It's all up in taking care of. So what do you think the emperor did? What do you think the emperor did? Have you guys heard of this story? He killed them all. He killed the high official. He killed the high official's commissioners. He killed the test makers. He killed those who got the very best scores on the Kuju. The reason why is the emperor does not want a fair, open, and transparent system. He wants a system in which the localities will not rebel against the center. And that's what the Kuju is. So that is it. We will do Genghis Khan next class."}

So we are doing Mohammed and the rise of Islam today. Mohammed, as you know, is one of the most important and influential figures in human history. He is as important as Jesus. But ironically, we actually don't know that much about Mohammed. In fact, we probably know more about Jesus than we know about Muhammad. With Jesus, at least we have a lot of his quotations, a lot of his sayings, which give us insight into his philosophy, his religion, his thinking. But with Muhammad, we don't have that many quotations. We don't have that many written sources. In fact, the Koran, which is the holy book of the Islamic tradition, doesn't really mention him, even though in theory it is written by him. In fact, one of the earliest written documents about Muhammad is actually from a Christian bishop, written about 20, 30 years after Muhammad's death in 632 CE. So we know that he was a real person and he was the founder of the Islamic tradition. And this is what Sibil says about Muhammad. At that time, a certain man from along those same sons of Ishmael whose name was Mamad, so Mamad is Muhammad. In fact, we don't even know what his real name is. Muhammad just means blessed one in Arabic. A merchant. He was a merchant, as if by God's command appeared to them as a preacher. So he was a prophet who rallied the Arabs to his cause. Abiding their vain cults, they turned to the living God who had appeared to the father Abraham. Okay? So Muhammad converted the polytheistic Arabs to the monotheism of the Jews. So, Mamet legislated for them not to carry on, not to drink wine, not to speak falsely, and not to engage in fornication. He said, with an oath, God promised this land to Abraham and his seed after him forever. And he brought about as he promised during that time while he loved Ishmael. So what he's saying is the Arabs are the descendants of Abraham, just like the Jews and the Christians. But now you are the sons of Abraham and God is accomplishing his promise to Abraham and his seed to you. You have God promised you the promised land and now this land has been taken away from you. Jerusalem issue has been taken away from you and now we will take it back by going to war, Jihad, holy war. love sincerely only the God of Abraham and go and cease the land which God gave to your father Abraham. No one will be able to resist you in battle because God is with you. So this is actually very similar to the story of Moses in the Bible. The Jews were enslaved in Egypt, and Moses appeared before them and promised to take them back to Israel. So this is clearly following an ancient tradition. And so, Muhammad in many ways is like Moses. In fact, what's really strange is that in the Quran, the most quoted figure, the figure that is most mentioned is Moses, not Muhammad or Jesus. So let's try to figure out what's going on here. First of all, what Muhammad is saying is that Christians, Jews, and Arabs are all one big family. Why? Because in the Bible it says that Abraham made a covenant with Yahweh. Yahweh Abraham swore allegiance to Yahweh in return. Yahweh gave him the Promised Land. The Promised Land is is not ish real. The Promised Land is all that territory going from the Nile to the Tigris in modern day Iraq. So it's basically the entire Middle East. That's what the Promised Land is. Now, this is important because Abraham had a wife, Sarah. Sarah, for most of her life, was not able to give birth. And if you don't have descendants, if you have children they don't get the promised land, right? So in desperation, Sarah gave Abraham her maid named Haggoth. And Abraham implanted Haggoth and Haggoth gave birth to a son named Ishmael. And then Ishmael went to the Arabian desert and he is the father of the Arab people. And that's where Mohammed comes from, the Arabs. Sarah, by the miracle of God, would eventually be able to give birth to the Israelites. As we know, the Israelites will eventually become the Christians. So in other words, the Christians, the Jews, and the Muslims, they have a common ancestor in Abraham. So this is what this is saying. So even though we don't have that many written sources about Mohammed, we have something called the Hadith. The Hadith. The Hadith is Arabic and it just means an oral tradition. So there are these stories about Mohammed that has been passed on orally from generation to generation celebrating his life. And so let's go over what is traditionally understood about Mohammed. So Muhammad was born in the year 570 into an Arab tribe. And he's born in a place called Mecca in the Arabian desert. He became a traitor because a merchant, because most people at that time were either nomads or merchants. And at a very young age, he married a very wealthy widow. And until the age of 40, his life was prosperous but uninventful. Then at age 40, he started to meditate in a cave. That's a very common thing, to go to a cave and to meditate as a form of religious worship. And while he was at the cave, the angel Gabriel appeared before Muhammad. And he said to Muhammad, you and your family have lost the way. You are the descendants of Ishmael who brought the religion of Yahweh to the desert. Back then you were monotheistic. But then over time you became corrupted and became polytheistic. And so you have a mission to tell your fellow Arabs the story of Yahweh, the story of the Bible, and to return them to the love of Yahweh, return them to monotheism. And so Gabriel in a series of visions would tell Mohammed the story of the Bible, okay, including Moses, his taking the people, the Trojan people, the Jews from Egypt back the Promised Land. And this is considered a miracle and true because Mohammed was an illiterate merchant who had no exposure to the Bible. So this had to be true. And this shows that this is all a miracle. So Mohammed is now inspired by the archangel Gabriel to preach the word of God. But at this time, Arabia is a polytheistic, primitive, and backward society. So the people of Mecca reject him. He spends 30, 13 years in Mecca preaching the word, but they reject him. So eventually he decides to move to Medina. And this move is very important. It's called the Hijjah. the immigration. He and his followers moved from Mecca to Medina and this starts the Islamic tradition. And this marks the year zero in the Islamic calendar. Just as the birth of Jesus marks the year zero in the Christian calendar. So he goes to Medina because the tribes there have invited him to be a judge. The tribes there, one of the tribes is actually Jewish. They're fighting amongst themselves. And they need someone to arbitrate their disputes. And so Muhammad goes and he creates something called the Constitution of Medina, which promises the freedom of religious expression to all people. There will be no religious prejudice in Medina. Eventually, over time, more and more followers are attracted to his message of monotheism and he starts to build a following, an army. And, but because he's preaching a faith that is counter the mainstream faith, he gets attacked by other Arab tribes and there's some setbacks, but through the love of God, through the will of God, he triumphs over them and he unites the Arabian Peninsula. Now at this point, they are a threat to the two major world empires at this time, the Byzantine Empire, who are the Heirs of the Roman Empire, as well as the Sassanian Persian Empire. And they both attack him, sorry, they both attack the Muslims. But again, through the miracle of God, the Muslims are able to defeat both empires. And in less than 100 years, they conquer most of the world. It is one of the greatest mysteries in world history, how this happened, all right? How was it possible for desert people, okay? These are desert nomads, who are poor, primitive and backward, how they were able to defeat two world empires and conquer most of the world. Their empire at their height would stretch from Spain in the West all the way to India, and would include Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and Iran. Very impressive. How did they do that? And this mystery has never been solved. We will try in today's class to solve this mystery. In today's class, we'll try to answer three major questions. First of all, who was Muhammad really? Who was this person? What did he believe? What did he want? That's the first question. The second question is, how was this new religion, Islam, able to triumph? All right? And the third and last question is, why do we know so little about the early history of the Islamic tradition? Okay, so given that we know so little about the early history, and given that there are few written sources about the early history. And very little archeology has been done because Mecca Medina are the two holiest sites in the Islamic tradition. So we don't have that much evidence. In this situation, we can only use historical analogs. Are there historical incidents that mirror or similar to what happened in the Arabian Peninsula 1500 years ago. And the answer is there are some, there are actually many, many similarities. All right, so I always look at three ones, I always look at three, okay? The first is from 1850 to 1864 in China, there's something called the Taiping Rebellion. I'm not sure if you know the story, But what happened was there was this young man, owning his 20s, but his name is Homeshield Trent. And he's trying to become a scholar official by taking the examination. And he's failed three times already. After his third attempt, he runs into a Christian missionary who gives him a pamphlet. And he just peruses that pamphlet and he learns about Jesus. Then he has a dream where he meets Jesus and Jesus tells him, you're my brother, you're my little brother. And after he fails the exam for the fourth time, he decides to abandon that scholar official route and embrace his destiny as the brother, as the Chinese brother of Jesus. And eventually, over the course of 10 years, he's able to build a following. that eventually conquers most of China. And he's almost able to overthrow the Qing Empire. But there are some other factors at work. For example, the Western powers, mainly the British Empire, intervene on behalf of the Qing dynasty. So, a very similar situation with the Muslim conquests of the world, right? These are peasants who have this It's a very strange new religion, and somehow they're able to beat a major empire. And what the story of the Taiping rebellion tells us is a new religion that is revolutionary in the right social, historical, economic circumstances can be very powerful. Okay, so what drove the Taiping soldiers in battle was both the idea of religious devotion, God is with us, and revolutionary zeal. We are making a new world. And when soldiers are infused with both religious devotion and revolutionary zeal, they're not afraid to die. They will fight to the death. And that's why they were able to overwhelm the government's soldiers. Same thing happened in something called the war of the Canudos from 1896 to 1898 in Europe. The Canudos is a northern province in Brazil. And Brazil, for most of its history, was an extremely racist society where minorities were persecuted by the predominantly Spanish and white colonizers. And it was extremely unequal society where a few landlords controlled all the wealth. So the Canudos was a rebellion to overflow these landlords and establish a kingdom of heaven. It was led by this preacher who preached the coming of the kingdom of heaven just like Jesus. And he was surrounded by these peasants who overthrew the landlords. He was surrounded by bandits who were criminals, basically. They didn't have any guns. They didn't have any weapons. They didn't have any soldiers. The prison army saw them as a threat. And they sent three expeditions against these peasants. All three times, the prison army was destroyed. They lost the battle. Why? Because again, when peasants have revolutionary zeal and religious devotion, they're not afraid to die. And so hand to hand, they were able to defeat the British soldiers who were well armed and well trained. So with the Fourth Expedition, the British Army decided to send everyone. The entire British Army was sent against this peasant uprising because they saw this as a threat to the social order. And what they did was rather than engage the peasants in hand to hand combat directly, they surrounded the area with artillery and they bombarded the peasants until they were all dead. They basically nuked the peasants, okay? Because they could not defeat the peasants hand in hand or directly. And in both times, the Typing Rebellion and the War of the Canudos, you can say it was a religious movement, but they were both revolutions. They were trying to overthrow the established social order. So let's look at one more example of this, which is the French Revolution. Now, we're gonna spend a lot of time on the French Revolution next semester, so I don't wanna spend too much time on it right now, okay? But you know the basic outline of the French Revolution, right? Where the nobility and the Marquis were thrown, and they established a new revolutionary government. And the monarchies of Europe united against France, because they saw France as a threat to the established social order of Europe. And the French revolutionaries were able to defeat the combined armies of Europe. And under Napoleon, they established a French empire. So all three incidents are very similar to what happened in the Arabian Peninsula, in 600 C. So in other words, what I believe happened is the Muslims were the world's first global revolution. OK? So let me explain what I mean by that. OK. So first of all, let's better understand the Arabian Peninsula at this time. OK? So this is the year 600. And again, there are two major world empires between the Arabian Peninsula. There's the Byzantine Empire, which is basically like this. These are the Byzantines. And they are the heirs to the Romans. So basically the Eastern Roman Empire. And they still figure themselves as the Roman Empire. But historically, we call them the Byzantines now. And over here are what we call the Sasanian Persian Empire. And as you can see, they're huge. This is India, and this is Spain, by the way. And this is Egypt. So these are huge world empires. And then you have the Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula, which is this desert. And you look at this map, you'd be like, oh my god, how was it possible for the Arabs to defeat both the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Persian Empire? And the answer is this. What people don't understand, what is not recognized, is in 600 CE, the hotbed of innovation was actually here in the Arabian Peninsula. This was the most creative, the most open, and the most cosmopolitan center in the world at this time. And that's what people don't really understand. So let me explain why. Okay, as you can see from this map, Arabia, the Arab Peninsula, it's a desert, but it's basically the center of the world. And remember, in this class what you're taught is the world has always been connected through trade. Okay, so the Arabian Peninsula, even though you can't really have cities because you don't have any rivers, and you can't really grow crops, you can't have agriculture, they've been trading with other nations and civilizations for thousands of years, okay? Because there's a crisscross of empire. So if India wanted to access Egypt, okay, because again, Egypt for the longest time was the wealthiest civilization, then they have to first send their goods to Arabia. And then the nomads would transport the goods into Egypt. OK? So what does it mean to be a trading center? Well, the first thing that it means is you have access to the most advanced technology, information, and knowledge in the world. Because you're a trader. You go everywhere. And you bring back not just goods, but stories and information. They know everything about the world. They know exactly what's happening in the Biden Empire. They know exactly what's happening in the South of the Empire, even though most people don't know what's happening in the desert. Also, because you're traders, they're extremely open-minded and cosmopolitan. They have no prejudices. They have to be friends with everyone. And the third thing is, because you're traders, they have to constantly learn new information. So that's the first unique characteristic about the Arabian Peninsula at this time. These are open-minded, cosmopolitan people who are constantly absorbing new information, new knowledge to better their society. A certain thing about the Arabian Peninsula is that it's a war society. You don't have cities, you don't have centralized control. It's all just tribes, okay? Just different clans, different families fighting each other. So honor is very important. If you offend someone in my family, we go to war. But guess what? Because they're always at war, these are strong, brave people who know how to fight. And that's why both the Byzantines and the Sassinians hired these people as mercenaries. And so as mercenaries, they were learning the most advanced warcraft, military doctrine of both the assassins and the Byzantines. These were the best soldiers in the world, basically. And what happened is that over time, the Byzantines and assassins would establish client states within the Arabian Peninsula. So these are client states. So that's the second thing. This is a war society who know how to fight. The third thing that makes the Arabian Peninsula so innovative is its diversity. So what do I mean by that? OK, so as we discussed last class, Augustine creates this intellectual blueprint for the Catholic Church. And the focus is on obedience. The idea is Orphanoxy, meaning there is only one proper way to understand our religion. If you disagree, then it's heresy. Okay? And as we discussed, the problem with the Christian religion is it's very, very confusing. So we talked about the example of the Godhead, right? Jesus, Holy Spirit, and God are one and the same. Well, this creates a lot of problems. For example, the very basis of the Christian religion is that Jesus died for our sins. Jesus was sacrificed, he was crucified, and he suffered for our sins. Here's a question, though. How does God suffer? How does God die? That makes no sense. So one debate that has never ended, okay? Even today, Christians still fight over, it's the idea of Christology. What is the nature of Christ? Is he divine? Is he human? Is he both? Is he half-half? Was he human here and then divine up there? There are lots of possibilities. And even today Christians cannot agree. Okay? So, even so, from the first day, Christians have fought over each other, over the nature of Christ and the nature of the Godhead. And again, because of Orphanoxy, there's only one interpretation, and you must follow that interpretation. And if you don't follow that interpretation, guess what? You either have to go somewhere else or you die. And so they're forced to go east, right? They either go to the Sassanian Empire or they go to the Arabian Desert. Many choose to go to the Arabian Desert. Why? Because in the Arabian Desert, there's no sense of authority. You are free to practice the faith as you choose. And guess what? Often, those who are the most heretical, those who want to practice their own faith, are the most innovative because they like to ask questions, they like to explore. They want to practice a personal faith. They believe that God is someone you communicate with. The Catholic Church demands that you can only access God through priests. You're not allowed to read the Bible, you're not allowed to question orthodoxy. And the most intelligent people want to do that. They want to speak to God. They want to practice their own personal faith. They want to ask questions. And then this word at this time, the only place you can do that is the Arabian Desert. So you have lots of Christians. Here are Christians who are very controversial. They all end up in the Arabian Desert, in order to practice their faith. You also have a lot of Jews in the Arabian Desert. Why? Well, first of all, I mean, The Arabian desert is very close to Jerusalem, right? So there's always been Jews there as traders. And when they go to the Arabian desert, remember, this is a common story about how the Arabs and the Jews come from one big family, Abraham, okay? So they're able to coalesce in a mingle, in a merry, fairly easily. You also had a lot of Jews who are escaping persecution, right? You also had a lot of Jews who fought in the Civil War against Rome, and they lost, and they had to run to the Arabian desert. Okay, so you have a lot of Jews here as well. You also have Zoroastrianists from the Sassanian Empire who, again, want to practice their own personal faith. So the Arabian desert, it is a hotbed of religious diversity and religious tolerance. You are allowed to practice any faith, and people respect that. And again, they have some of the smartest Jews and Christians and Jor-Astronians in the world at this point. People who will eventually lend their expertise to the Arab military machine. So they will help the Arabs develop innovative siege warfare and military doctrine and science as well. Does that make sense? At the same time while Arabia is increasing in terms of innovation and wealth and diversity, both the Byzantines and the Sassanians are declining in terms of social stability. So as we discussed in this class, whenever you have stability, what happens is you will eventually have inequality and corruption. So people within the Bai'san Empire are extremely unhappy for three reasons. The first reason is the problem of landlessness. Second problem is debt. These are problems that have existed throughout human history. Why are there so many revolutions in Chinese history? because of these two problems, right? Because there are a few people who control all the land and because the peasants get into debt, so much that they can't pay it back and their entire family for generations are enslaved to the landlords. But also at this time, because of the Catholic Church, you also have the problem of religious persecution. You are not allowed to practice your own faith. You are only allowed to practice the faith that the Catholic Church demands of you. And the same situation is also true in the Persian Empire. So the people are extremely unhappy. At the same time, there's a lot of instability within the government of these empires. Why? Well, first of all, because they're always fighting each other. So wars, they're always fighting each other. And that causes them to lose a lot of resources. Second is, whenever you have large cities, you have the problem of plagues, right? Disease, plagues. So there are these plagues called the Justinian plague that wiped out about 10 to 20% of the population at this point. And the third problem is civil wars, right? Because whenever an emperor dies, they fight over who's next emperor. So in other words, we think it seems that the Byzantines and the Sassans are really strong and the Arabs are really weak. We actually analyze it. You realize that, oh, wow, the Byzantines are extremely weak. The Sassans are really weak. The Arabs are really strong. The problem with the Arabs though is they're divided. They divide into like thousands, tens of thousands of different tribes. So the question now is, how do you unite them? So you need a leader to come and inspire the people. Okay, and this is Mohammed. Now, what's important for us to understand is there are lots of different prophets who think they are the Ma'zai at this point, okay? Because both the Zoroastrian religion and the Christian religion and the Jewish religion believe that the Ma'zai will come. Okay, and we call this apocalyptic eschatology. This is very, this is very, very popular, right? Because of empires, because the more stable empires are, the more corruption, the more inequality, the more social stagnation there are, okay? So people actually turn towards the idea of apocalyptic eschatology. So there are 100 people who figure themselves as a messiah. But eventually, Muhammad becomes a messiah of their people, okay? And why? Well, fortunately, we have a formulation of a great leader that we've learned in this class. So let me remind you of this formulation. The person is so strategic that he becomes visionary. Second is, the person is so innovative, he becomes revolutionary. The third is, the person is so disciplined, he becomes selfless. And so there are many individuals we've met in this class that follow this formula. So for example, Philip of Macedon, as was Julius Caesar. Philip and Julius Caesar, we imagine warfare. They made their armies into meritocracies, where the very best and the most loyal were able to rise up in the ranks, regardless of class or caste. And they were selfless. They were always in the first in battle. They put their lives, they put the soldiers' lives first. Okay? And so we can say that whoever Mohammed was, fit would fit this description. Okay? So let me explain. All right. You are in the Arabian Peninsula. There are tens of thousands of different factions, different tribes who have been fighting each other for centuries. They don't really like each other. Now, how do you unite them? How do you get everyone to work together and defeat both the Byzantines and the assassins? Well, you have, if you have three different messages, you can unite everyone, okay? The first message is this. We are all God's children, okay? Arabs, Jews, Christians, we are all descendants of Abraham. Therefore, we are all God's children. We are one big family. There should be no religious difference and persecution among us. And because we're all God's children, and because we're all different, we should be free to practice any religion we want. The Christian religion is just as valid as the Jewish religion. So the first thing that you say. Second thing that you can say is that We are, we, okay, so you're basically creating a meritocracy. The idea of meritocracy is basically revolution, right? The idea of class, the idea of caste, the idea of tribal royalties goes against the will of God because we're all God's children. We're all equal in the eyes of God. Therefore, those who are most willing to work hard to achieve God's vision on earth should rise to the top. regardless of your religion, regardless of your class, regardless of your caste. It's a meritocracy. And the third message is, God gave us the promised land. This land that extends from the Nile to the Tigers is what God promised us. We are all God's children, so each and every one of us should have land. But the Byzantines, the Persian stole this land from us. But the landlords, the wealthy, stole it from us. Therefore we must fight a jihad to take it back because that is God's will. When we take it back, we will establish a kingdom of heaven on earth. We will follow God's law. God's law demands equality. It demands mercy and tolerance. It demands openness. That is God's law. So it's Muhammad. So in other words, Muhammad was a revolutionary who wanted to overflow the social order in order to establish the kingdom of heaven. He was the Messiah, promised to the Jews and promised to the Christians, and who will now unite Arabs, Christians, and Jews in achieving the kingdom of heaven on earth. That's who Muhammad was. And so let's go back and we read the description of Mohammed and his army by Sibyls to see if this is correct. Okay? At that time, a certain man from along the same lines, same sons as of Ishmael, whose name was Mahmet, a merchant, asked if by God's command. Okay? So he is the Messiah. He is the promised one. God has ordered him to do this. them to as a preacher. Okay? So he united them. Okay? And they started to see themselves as all the children of Abraham and therefore the children of God. And then Mamid gave them the law of God, not to eat, carry on, not to drink wine, not to speak falsely and not to engage in fornication. This is a law of God. This is the king of heaven. He said, women of God promise this land to to Abraham in his seed after him forever. This is the land that God promised to us, his children. But the Romans have it, the Persian have it, the landlords have it. And he brought about as he promised during that time, while he loved Ishmael. But now you are the sons of Abraham and God is accomplishing his promised Abraham in his seed to you. Okay? I have come to you as God's messenger, God's prophet, to tell you that this land is yours and you must take it back. Love sincerely only the God of Abraham and go and cease the land which God gave to your Father Abraham. Cease the land. Overfowl the tyrants. Overfowl the landlords. Take it back. No one will be able to resist you in battle because God is with you. Okay? So this combines revolutionary zeal overturning social order with religious devotion. God is with us. And this is the same mentality that drove the French Revolution, the war of the Canadiots in Brazil in the Taipei rebellion in China. And so this is the first truly global revolution. And this explains why the Muslims were able to triumph over both the Byzantines and the Sassanians because when they, wherever they went, they freed the people from debt and lendlessness and religious persecution. You are now allowed to practice any faith you want. You have that freedom now. That's important to people. You now have some land where you can grow crops and you, and we will wipe away your debt. Okay? So in less than a hundred years, okay, look what happened. They were able to conquer the entire Persian Empire and half of the Byzantine Empire. That's the power of religious devotion and revolutionary zeal. So that's how they were able to do it. Now the last question we have is, why don't we know any of this? Why isn't this taught in history books? The answer is, because the Revolution worked out. Because they won. They achieved the Revolution. But now, after they achieved the Revolution, they've become an empire. If you're an empire, you don't want people to revolt against you. So you have to whitewash this history. You don't want people to know that Muhammad was a revolutionary. So you change the history. The issue is that Mohammed was disgusted by the inequality and corruption he saw in the world around him. And he promised the people freedom from religious persecution, from debt, and from landlessness. And that's what drew followers to him. You don't want another Mohammed appearing in your empire. So you change the history and say that, oh, no, no. The real conflict was that Mohammed wanted monotheism, the Arabs wanted polytheism. That's what the problem was. And the same is true in China today, right? Who created the Chinese Revolution? Who enabled the Communist Party to control China? Mao Zedong, right? Do you learn about Mao Zedong in school? No, you don't. Same thing, you understand? So they're trying to whitewash their history. because it's embarrassing for a global empire to celebrate a revolutionary who hated corruption and inequality. And that's why there's so little written about Muhammad and that's why the Quran doesn't really tell us that much about Muhammad, okay? Because his revolution won. Okay, is this clear to you? Do you have any questions? Okay, all right. So we have two more classes for the semester ends. They're both on Dante. The reason why is Dante is the greatest poet, the greatest prophet in human history. And he's really the second coming of Homer. Remember, Homer created Greek civilization. Well, Dante, with his work, the Vankhomni, will create modern European civilization. So next class, next Thursday, we'll start looking at Dante."}

So last class we discussed that Putin loves his country, Russia, and he believes that Western consumerism has corrupted his nation. And he recognizes that the source of Western consumerism is the American Empire. So in order to completely free his people, He needs to destroy the empire. Okay? And historically, empires die when three things happen concurrently, okay, together. The first is overextension. And this is the main reason why empires die, when they fight too many wars at once. And the reason why they're overextended is hubris. And what hubris is in military strategy is the idea of blindness. So you are blind to the fact of your own limitations. You are blind to the strategy of your opponents. You are blind to the overall geopolitical picture. You're just blind. And the example is American strategy nowadays, where America is fighting Russia and Ukraine, where it is fighting Hamas in Israel, and there's a threat of Iran on the horizon. But for whatever reason, most American policymakers believe that the real threat is China. We must prepare for China in the Taiwan Strait, okay? Eventually, China will invade Taiwan and we must be ready. Right now, this week, America also announced massive tariffs on Chinese electrical vehicles. And so America has engaged in all these wars at once. It's antagonizing Russia, Iran, China at the same time. And so that's just overextension because of hubris. Okay? Second way to call an empire is debt. So the source of American power is the US dollar. Remember that in 1945, Bretton Woods, there was an agreement that the US dollar would become the reserve currency of the world. Okay? And the word, the phrase for that is exorbitant privilege. Exorbitant privilege just means that America has the right to manufacture gold from nothing, and the world has to buy it because that's what underpins global trade. But when you can do that, what happens eventually is that your nation becomes fat, lazy, and corrupt. And money just falls off the sky, you're just used to borrowing money, okay? So all America does right now is print money and not make money. The problem with this is that eventually the world is not gonna want to US dollars anymore because each time you use it, you're being taxed, right, by the Americans. And that's what Bricks Plus is. You may have heard of Bricks Plus. This organization established initially by Brazil, Russia, in the China and South Africa, in order to create its own financial system to counter the US financial system. But now there are more countries that have joined BRICS. Most prominently are Saudi Arabia and UAE and Buran, these countries, okay? They're important because they are the basis for the petro dollar. Remember that all US dollars, US dollars can be used to purchase oil and that's why US dollar is worth a lot of money, okay? So these countries go to breaks and opt out of the US financial system, then basically this American mountain of debt, okay, $35, $200 of debt comes crashing down, okay? That's the second way to kill an empire. And the third way is civil, civil dissent or eternal discord, civil war basically. And so what we're seeing in America right now is growing political polarization, okay, between the left and the right. Why this happens is that people no longer believe the binding myths and stories that build a nation, okay? Nowadays, young people don't believe that America is the source of good in this world. An example of why this is happening is of course because Israel right now is committing genocide in Gaza. Right now Israel is attacking Ratha and they're killing a lot of children. Most people who are dying in this war are children. And America is not doing anything to stop this. In fact, America is the one who's providing issue with all the weapons. So young people are turning against the idea of America as the good empire. And there's this amazing statistic that one quarter of young Americans now believe that Osama bin Laden was a good guy. Okay? And you know, when I grew up, Osama bin Laden was considered Satan, because he was the one who was responsible for terrorism around the world and for the 9-11 attacks. But this just shows you that the ideas and the myths that bind the country together are falling apart. And that's what's causing the nation to fall apart. So the more over committed America is, the more debt it creates, and the more civil discord it creates. So this is how you kill an empire. When all three things reach a tipping point, When it becomes too much, the empire dies. And the most likely outcome for America is it goes into civil war. It descends into civil war. And that's something that I will discuss next class. So let's discuss how Putin is doing this. So the first thing that Putin did was the Ukraine war. So in February 2022, Putin invaded Ukraine. And at that time, America was confident that three things would happen. Okay? The first thing that would happen is that Ukraine would destroy the Russian army. And perhaps even march to Moscow and overthrow Putin. Okay? Wait, at that time, that's what the news media was reporting. The Ukraine media was so much stronger and more confident than the Russian forces. Second thing was that the Russian economy would be destroyed. Why? Because America was imposing sanctions on Russia. So America, because it controls the global financial system, the ability to trade. America just basically sanctioned Russia and said, you are no longer allowed to sell your oil on the global market. Okay? And the belief was that this would cause Russia to collapse overnight. A lot of Western multinationals left Russia and the United States froze 300 billion dollars in Russian assets in US banks. Okay? So they thought that these US, the United States thought that these sanctions would destroy the Russian economy. Okay? That's the second thing that they thought would happen. And the third thing that would happen was that it would make NATO much stronger and more united and it would make Russia into a pariah state. Meaning that no one would want to ever associate with Russia again. So that was the argument back then. And today what we have seen is that the complete opposite has happened. So first of all, Russia has basically won the war. And it's won the war because of attrition, right? Ukraine has lost maybe 500,000 men in this war. So they had no more manpower. If you don't have manpower, you're not going to be able to fight this war. So this war has basically been lost. And Russia is dominant. Russia has basically achieved its main strategic objectives, which is basically the Donetsk region in Eastern Ukraine. Secondly, not only has the Russian economy not been destroyed, but it's been doing extremely well. And the reason why is that ultimately all economies, China, India, Europe, Africa, Middle East, they all need resources in order for their economies to work. You need oil, you need food. And Russia has a lot of oil and food. And that's why countries have been going to Russia and making side deals. Also, Russia has been transitioning to a war economy, so its manufacturing base has been increasing. So overall, the economy has been doing a lot better. US sectors have not been working. And the third of all, NATO has become more divided, and less united. Why? Because Germany, which is the most powerful country in Europe right now, it's completely dependent on Russian resources to fill its economy. That's how the German economy works. It's a manufacturing economy. It takes cheap Russian gas, manufactures it into cars and sells it to China. But the United States blew up the North Stream pipeline, which basically delivered gas from Russia to Germany. And it's imposing a trade war on China. So basically, the German economy is about to collapse. And Germans are very angry about this. So the Ukraine war has been a tremendous success for Putin and it's really shown that America is a paper tiger. And it's also creating a lot of civil dissent in America because the majority of Americans are asking the question, why are we giving Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars when our people don't even have health insurance? Our people are suffering and we're giving Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars. Okay? The other thing that this Ukraine war has exposed is that the American Empire is overextended. And what I mean by that is that in order to give Ukraine weapons, what America is doing is basically taking weapon systems from in Japan, in South Korea, in other places, and giving it to Ukraine. So America is not manufacturing more weapons, it's just taking other weapons systems it has elsewhere and moving it to Ukraine. So America is badly overextended. And of course, by giving all this money to Ukraine, it's causing American debt to go up. And after Ukraine loses war, this debt will be gone. Because Ukraine cannot pay it back. So when after the Ukraine war, what happened next was on October 7 of last year, remember that Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed about 1,000 people. And Israel responded by attacking Gaza. And by doing this, this has helped Putin and has hurt the United States. Mainly by, first of all, diminishing American prestige. Because America right now is helping Israel commit genocide. So the entire world is basically turning against America, even the young people in America are turning against America. These college protests in America, they will only expand in the fall. The other problem is that America is shown it cannot control Israel. In fact, people say that Israel now controls America. And the third thing is that this war threatens to explode throughout the Middle East. At any point, Iran can enter the battle. Hezbollah can enter the battle from the north. So it's a powder keg. It's like a lake of gasoline about to be lit on fire. So America is badly extended. So, and you can make the argument that either Putin knew about the Hamas attack or even encouraged the attack, okay? Because the main winner of the Hamas attack is obviously that and Putin. And the loser is America, okay? So this doesn't make sense so far. All right, so let's talk about the future or what are predictions moving forward. So if it is true that Putin's intention is to destroy the American Empire by focusing on these three fundamental weaknesses in the Empire, and if it is true that he sought the Ukraine war to further the deterioration of the Empire, if he is the one who is abetting Hamas, Then we can predict that Putin will continue to do certain things, okay? The first thing that he will do is he will drag on the Ukraine war. So he will not end it, he will not seek peace, he will not negotiate peace terms, he will continue to drag it on, okay? Why would he do that? Why not just declare victory? Or why not just negotiate peace? Why would he want to drag it on? OK, yeah, the Russian people will cost me war. But then the question then is, why would he drag it on and not expand it? He wants to drag it on, but he doesn't want to expand it. Expand it means he attacks Poland. He doesn't want to do that. He just wants to drag it on. Why? Yeah, OK. So the reason is that Ukraine is turning out to be a black hole for NATO. NATO in the United States is putting in all this money, weapons and manpower and it's just losing it all. So in other words, Ukraine is a battlefield to increase American debt and create civil discord among NATO and America. Germany does not want to fight this war. Germany wants out, you understand? So as long as this war keeps on going, it's gonna create more friction between NATO and the United States and that's what Putin wants. But if Putin attacks Poland, then all NATO is forced to fight him. Does that make sense? So he does not want to expend the war. He just wants the war to maintain a status quo and for it to drag on. So that's the first prediction. Second is that to control the situation in Ukraine, he needs America to fight another war. He needs to distract America. And the distraction will be Iraq. Remember how for the past few classes, We've been discussing how America wants to attack Iran, and Iran wants to revenge against America. But for this to happen, what Putin needs to do is talk to Iran and guarantee that Iran will be protected by the Russian nuclear umbrella, which means that America will not be allowed to use nuclear weapons when it invades Iran, because Putin will respond with nuclear weapons of his own. Does that make sense? So as long as Putin comes to an agreement with Iran and say that I will use my nuclear weapons to protect you from US nuclear weapons, then Iran will take the initiative and start to provoke America into a wider war. And again, there are many ways Iran can do that. It can use Hezbollah to attack Israel. It can expand its nuclear program. It can disrupt Red Sea shipping. There are lots of ways that Iran can use to provoke America into a full-scale invasion, which is what Putin wants, all right? North Korea. So as the United States becomes distracted in Ukraine and Iran, North Korea can now take the initiative, right? Because what North Korea can do is threaten to invade South Korea. And there are about 30,000 US troops in South Korea. So North Korea doesn't actually have to do anything. But the threat of North Korea will force America to divert resources to South Korea. Does that make sense? Okay. And this will probably even have to force North, South Korea, United States to start to bribe North Korea. And we can expect that North Korea does this because Putin has given North Korea his assurance that he will protect North Korea in the event of a war. Okay, does that make sense? All right. Bricks. We will see Bricks continue to expand. We will also see Bricks maybe formally announce a new currency or a new trading system to counteract the American-led system. Now, what people have said is that Bricks is not capable of replacing the US dollar. And that is true, okay? But remember that Bricks doesn't have to actually replace the US dollar. It can only, it just has to threaten because a lot of finance, a lot of money, it's just confidence. Okay. You have to use all of it because you're confident that it's valuable. But once you lose the confidence in your installer, you will no longer want to use it. Okay. That doesn't make sense. And the last thing is to maintain close relationships, to maintain a very close relationship with China. So Putin will come to China more often and he and seating people will hug each other more, okay? They might even kiss one day, who knows, okay? But, and again, listen, the reality is if you look at game theory, there are lots of geopolitical differences between Russia and China, much more so than between China and United States. But again, putting that, doesn't actually need China to do anything, all putting needs is for China not to work in United States, okay? Because in this situation, one way that the United States can survive or protect its empire is by working with China, right? To triangulate against Russia. Does that make sense? So as long as China remains neutral, then Russia and Putin can continue to exert pressure on the American empire. So over the next three to four years, we should see all these things happen. So first thing is the Ukraine war does not end. Putin will find a way for it to drag on, but actually expanding, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is Iran takes the initiative against the United States. Third thing is North Korea starts becoming much more belligerent against South Korea and Japan, forcing America to focus more attention in East Asia. Bricks will continue to expand, and then the Putin relationship with Xi Jinping will continue to blossom, okay? Does that make sense? All right, any questions so far if you can continue? Excuse me? Okay, that's a good question. So why would America want China's help? Okay, the first thing is you have an overextension problem, you don't wanna be fighting too many wars at once. So you come to a peace with China, you don't have to worry about East Asia anymore. Because the real threat from America's perspective is that China invades Taiwan. That's the first thing. Second thing is that China is a major buyer of US dollars because of its trade with America and because China buys a lot of oil, right? You want China to keep on buying US dollars so you can sustain the debt, okay? Does that make sense? And third of all, there are a lot of geopolitical conflicts between Russia and China. If you think about it, Russia is more of a threat to China than the United States is. Does that make sense? Historically, Russia and China fought many wars over the border. So if you become friends with China, then Putin needs to take the defensive and focus more on protecting the Russia-China border. Does that make sense? Because right now, Putin can just focus on the offensive. But if China is on the side of the United States, then Putin is forced on the defensive. Does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? Yeah, Peter? That's right. That's right, that's right. So basically what's been happening is China is now no longer buying US dollars. And it's transferring its US dollars into gold, okay? So China is encouraging everyone to buy gold. Don't buy any more US dollars, guys. Buy gold, right? And the reason why is because America's debt is a huge problem for America. And the only way for America to sustain its debt is if China continues to buy US debt. Does that make sense? But that's a great point, Peter. Any more questions before I continue? OK. So Jack asked a great question. It makes sense for China and the United States to be friends, right? Because China exports a lot of commodities to the United States. The United States is a huge market. United States also provides China with a lot of technology, right? And Jack asked a question, why would China want to be friends with Russia? And the answer is because China right now feels threatened by the United States. The United States is launching an economic war against China. And if you look at a map, China surrounded by US military bases. And the problem is that China needs imports of oil and food to sustain its economy. Doesn't make sense. So if America ever launches a embargo against China, China collapses. Okay. So in other words, China needs to open up new trade routes. And the only way, and the best partner right now is Russia, because it has a lot of access to energy and oil. Okay, so right now the situation in China is that Chinese policymakers know that the situation in China is terrible. The economy has collapsed, demographics has collapsed, China is completely dependent on the world for oil and food. Okay, China is extremely vulnerable right now. If America says the world, China is our enemy, then China has no choice but to find a new friend. And unfortunately, the only friend that China has right now is Russia, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, so, but look, I mean, the geopolitical situation for China, it's really, really bad, okay? Any more questions before I continue? Okay, so Selene asked a great question. Why does the United States think that China will attack Taiwan? And the answer is that America is always looking to start new wars. It has something called the military industrial complex. And America is always fighting wars. So to justify all this defense spending, it needs to find new enemies. And it believes that the greatest threat to the American empire right now is China. Even though, by the way, there's no evidence this is the case. Right now the relationship between the United States and China is, China sends America a lot of cheap goods, and the US gives China a lot of US dollars. So basically what's happening is that the Communist Party is storing the wealth of the Chinese people in American banks. This is a great deal for both America, Wall Street, and the Chinese Communist Party. So there's no reason for these countries conflict with each other, but unfortunately the American policymakers always need an enemy to justify the incredible amount of money they spend on defense. Does that make sense? Any more questions before I continue? Excuse me? I didn't understand the questions. Can you repeat that? Oh, that's a great question. So what happens if China takes over Taiwan? What does America lose? And the answer is not that much. You can make the argument that Taiwan has a semiconductor industry, but guess what? You can move that semiconductor industry elsewhere. Okay. For America, it's just one of face. You understand America doesn't really lose anything if China takes over Taiwan, but for America, it's the empire. It has hubris and therefore it must say face. Right. Does that make sense? All right. All right. So this is Putin's plan to destroy the American Empire. And so the question then is, well, this makes Putin a genius. So how is he able to do this? And the argument I want to make to you today is that for many reasons, Russian leaders have a strategic imagination. They just think differently and more strategically than anyone else. And so the example I want to use is Joseph Stalin, because we actually know a lot about Joseph Stalin. So let's look at the world in 1939. And in 1939, there were about six global powers. There's Soviet Union. There's Japan. There's United States. There's UK, Britain, the British Empire, Germany, and France. So this is the map of the world in 1939. Now, let's talk about each country. The United States is far away, and it's neutral. It does not like to get involved in the affairs of Europe. But it's suffering from the Great Depression. Its economy has collapsed. Japan, the Japanese Empire, is a war machine. But the problem for Japan is that it is completely reliant on imports. It needs oil for its empire, its war machine. And there are only two sources of oil close by. There's the Soviet Union Far East, and then there's Southeast Asia. Now, Japan is getting most of its oil from the United States. But the United States is angry at Japan. Why is the United States angry at Japan? Do you guys know? Exactly, because Japan invaded China. And the United States doesn't want that. So it's very likely that the United States will eventually cut off all exports to Japan. And so Japan has a choice. You can either invade here or you invade here. But those are your two choices. That's Japan. You can either invade the Soviet Union or Southeast Asia. The Soviet Union is a communist country. And for the past 20, 30 years, it's been trying extremely hard to industrialize. But it's hard to industrialize because, first of all, no one wants to trade with the Soviet Union. So they can't get any resources. The Soviet Union is still very much an agricultural nation. And the Soviet Union doesn't really have that much technology and expertise. It doesn't really have that much human capital. So Soviet Union, it's a huge country. It's the world's largest country. It's an empire. But in terms of manufacturing and technology, it's behind the West, okay? Now in Europe, there are three nations. You have France, Germany, and the UK. The UK is an empire. It has colonies all around the world. Germany lost World War I, and so it has to pay all these reparations to UK and France. And now Hitler is in power, and Hitler is determined to reunite Germany, because Germany lost a lot of land, except World War I. So he wants to reunite greater Germany. That's his ambition. It's not the concoct of the world, it's to reunite Germany. And then you have France, which is the weakest of all these powers, but it still has an empire. So looking at a map in 1939, and we use game theory, what should be happening? Or what should happen maybe five years from now, 1945, okay? Let's use game theory to map out what should be happening, or what will happen, given this map, and given the individual players, the interests of these different nations. What do you expect to happen? Who does everyone hate? Who does everyone hate? Why does everyone want to invade the Soviet Union? Okay, yes, first of all, it has a lot of resources, and it's not that strong, okay? That's the first reason. But there's actually a better reason why everyone wants to attack the Soviet Union. Why? What's happening internally in the United States right now? The Great Depression. What ideology is a threat to the American government? Communism, okay, do you understand? So there's a global communist movement in the 1930s That's very, very powerful. In fact, in the 1930s, and you guys don't know this, but America was on the break of revolution, okay? The communists could have any time took over America if America failed to stop the economic bleeding that was happening, all right? So everyone was afraid of communism. Japan would have loved to invade Soviet Union because Japan hates communism. And Soviet Union has all the oil, right? So here comes Japan. Germany would love to destroy the Soviet Union because Nazis hated who the most. Who did Nazis hate the most? Why did they hate Jews? What did Hitler believe about Jews? Okay, they control the world of communism, but there's actually a better reason why he hated Jews. What's the problem with Jews? Okay, you guys don't know this, but they were all communists, okay? Hitler thought that all Jews were communists. So Hitler hated first and foremost communism. Okay? Nazism hated communism the most. So Hitler wanted to make the Soviet Union. How about France and the UK? How about France and the UK? What did they want to do? What did they, who did they hate? Russia, right? Soviet Union. United States? Sure, why not? Okay, do you understand? So 1945, if we just use game theory, okay? We should have expected that so if Soviet Union would have been partitioned into different countries, okay? these powers would have invaded the country together and colonize the Soviet Union and destroyed the threat of global communism once and for all. Okay, doesn't make sense. But that's not what happened, right? That's not what happened. What happened was that in 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. Okay, and when the moment that Hitler invaded Poland, France and Britain declared war on Germany. And then Germany defeated France and Britain. Okay? Britain was forced to return to its island, but Churchill refused to seek peace with Hitler. In fact, Hitler tried to seek peace with Churchill seven times. And each time Churchill was like, go to hell. We're gonna fight this war till the end. Why was Churchill so angry at Hitler? What happened? Because Germany destroyed the British army, right? It's a complete loss of faith for the British Empire. So Churchill was very, very angry at Hitler and Churchill refused to ever negotiate with Hitler. And that Hitler sent this emissary called Rudolph Hess to Britain, to Scotland, to negotiate a truth and Churchill just put him in prison. Okay? But what's the irony of all this? Germany made Poland. What does Germany made Poland? You guys know? Have you guys studied this history? Okay, it's because of something called the Molotov Rippendrop Pat. So this was an agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany to partition Poland into two. Do you understand? So Germany and Soviet Union invaded Poland together. Soviet Union attacked from the east and the Germans attacked from the west. But what happened was, Britain and France declared war on Germany but not the Soviet Union, okay? That's pretty clever of Stalin, don't you think? In fact, you can make the argument that if this thing was not signed, would not have attacked Poland. And the reason why is, the other thing about this pact is that Soviet Union agreed to give Germany resources for its war machine, oil and food and other inputs. Does that make sense? Because remember, Soviet Union has to Ukraine, which produce a lot of food and oil. Does that make sense? Next thing that happened was that in June 1941, Operation Barbarossa, so Hitler invades the Soviet Union. And if you read history, anyone will tell you that this operation Barbarossa was a tremendous success for Germany and a strategic failure for a Soviet Union. It was a great mistake, strategic blunder for Stalin. What did Sun do wrong? Well, first of all, he refused to defend the border. There were 45 million Soviet troops at the border defending Soviet Union. But they were given direct orders to not to not to provoke the Germans. You understand? The Germans fire at you, don't fire back. And because of this order, the German Army, which was about to four million was able to overrun the border and almost reach Moscow. Okay? That was a great mistake on the part of Stalin. Second is that Stalin ignored intelligence. There was a lot of intelligence that said that Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union. How could you hide the fact that you have four million troops assembled to attack the Soviet Union? Okay? So there's a lot of intelligence going to Stalin and telling Stalin, Hey, the Germans are coming and Stalin said, nope, I refuse to believe this intelligence. In fact, you had German soldiers desert the German army, swim across the river to the Soviet side and tell the Soviets, hey, my comrades, the entire army is about to attack you. And the Soviets shot these German soldiers because they fought these German soldiers who were spies. Okay, so Stalin ignored intelligence. The third thing that Stalin did was before the outbreak of war, he purged the Soviet army of its leadership of generals. So the top generals of the Soviet army, the Red Army, were all dead or imprisoned because Stalin got rid of them for not being politically loyal enough. And the fourth thing is, why does Stalin do this? And the answer is, what historians will tell you is that Stalin trusted Hitler. This was the ultimate mistake that Stalin made. Stalin believed Hitler was his friend. He believed that Hitler would never invade him. Okay, and so this is what you're taught in History class when you go to the United States You'll be taught this when you go on the internet you'll be taught this okay? This is completely wrong. This analysis completely wrong All right, so we're gonna use game theory to understand why this is wrong all right So using game theory, but let's look at four possible scenarios. Okay scenario a is is Soviets attack first and they encircle Berlin. Second scenario is Soviets attack and they're stopped at the border. Scenario C is German's attack and the Soviets stop them. And scenario C is German's attack and they reach Moscow which is actually what happened. So these are four possible different scenarios that could have happened in June 1941. Remember that there were four to five million Soviet troops at the border. Okay, what were they doing there? They were about to attack Germany. The Soviets had a plan to attack Germany. But the Germans struck first, okay? So let's look at these four possible scenarios and see what happens. First scenario is the Soviets attack Germany first and they reach Berlin. What happens now? What happens now? What do all the other countries do? Yes, do you understand? Stalin reaches Berlin, boom! Japan comes from the east. Britain comes to the aid of Germany. The United States comes to the aid of Britain. All the world unites against the Soviet Union. So what would happen in this war? The Soviet Union loses this war. Do you understand? Now let's look at B. The Soviets invade, but the Germans stop them at the border. Okay? Not what happens. Not what happens. Yeah, so Japan still invades, okay? And Britain starts to negotiate with Germany and seek a peace, because Britain cannot afford for the Soviet Union to overrun Germany because then communism takes over Europe. Does that make sense? Okay? So in B, we can't say that the Caribbean would lose, but they would not win the war, okay? You understand? So B is not that good either. And let's look at C. The Germans attack and the Soviets hold them at the border. Not what happens. Not what happens. They just destroy each other, right? The United States, Britain, Japan, they're all laughing. They're like, oh, they're just killing each other. Who cares? Not a problem, okay? But now let's look at situation D, where the Germans attack and they are about destroy the Soviet Union. What happens now? The other countries have to come and help the Soviet Union. Why? Why is it the United States and Britain must come to help the Soviet Union? Why? What would happen if Germany takes over the Soviet Union? That's right, okay? They take over the resources, therefore they take over the world, you understand? Because Germany has technology, it has military power, but it lacks resources. You combine the resources with the German military, they're invincible now. The United States will be forever shut out of the world. Germany will not invade the United States, but the United States will never ever attack Germany again. Does that make sense? So what happens is, after the Soviets invade, sorry, after the Germans invade and the Soviet army is destroyed, America immediately gives the Soviet Union a lot of aid. It's what we call land leads. So 1941, 1945, America gave $200 billion to Soviet Union for free, okay? It gave weapons, resources, technology, and food. Basically, what America did was industrialize the Soviet Union. Does that make sense? That's what America did. Soviet Union could not industrialize by itself, but America helped Soviet Union to industrialize. Let's look at Lenly's, okay? Weapons. America gave the Soviet Union one third of all ammunition used in the war, one third of all explosives, one half of all aircraft, 14,000 airplanes, one half of all tanks, 13,000 tanks. Okay? Resources, America gave oil and food, 80% of all copper, 55% of aluminum and steel, okay? Technology, America gave the Soviet Union radio technology, radio communications, railroad transportation, heavy industry, and lots and lots of food. Okay. In other words, America basically built the Soviet Union in heavy industry for it. Okay. Does that make sense? And also at the end of the day, what's so being can do is reverse engineer all this technology and build its own industry. Doesn't make sense. Okay. So, landlies really turned the Soviet Union into a superpower. And Stalin could get all this for free because America could not afford for the Soviet Union to lose the war. Okay? What's the other benefit of having the Germans attack first and almost destroy Moscow? What's the other benefit? And Stalin really needed this. This is actually more important than landlies. Which is what? National unity, right? Now all the Soviets were united in the fight against Nazi Germany. Before communism was tearing the country apart. There was a civil war. The rich people all fled the country, right? But now because the Germans were invading the entire country was united against Germany. This is what they call the Great Patriotic War. They were fighting this war for the love of their country, the love of Mother Russia. So what turned the war was the will to fight. The Russians lost 26 million people in the war. That's a lot of people. But by losing this many people, it made the entire nation refuse to surrender. They had the will to fight, much more so than the Germans. Does that make sense? Okay? So in history, you're taught that Operation Barbarossa proved that Stalin was not a strategic genius, that he was played by Hitler. But if you just do game theory analysis, this was the best possible outcome for the Soviet Union, okay? In 1939, the world should have united against Soviet Union, but what happened was the world united against Nazi Germany, and gave Soviet Union the technology, the money, and the resources to become a global superpower. Right? Doesn't make sense. And because Soviet Union became a global superpower, it was able to turn China into a communist country. Doesn't make sense. If Soviet Union did not become a global superpower of all this heavy industry, then China would not become a communist power. Moscow would not have won the war. Okay? So in other words, all this is telling us is that Stalin is a genius. He turned a losing war into a winning war. Okay? So last thing I want to do is, okay, fine. How was Stalin able to do this? What makes the Russian imagination different from the Western imagination? Okay? So I would say three things. The first thing is just intuition. And intuition means that Putin and Stalin, they're able to read the political winds, okay? They're able to sense the mood of the world. The Germans word for this is zeitgeist, okay? Spirit of the times. But they're able to sense the mood of the world, okay? Putin knows that the American Empire is not to die. And so he feels important to act, okay? So it's intuition. Second is imagination. So Putin and Sun both have a strategic imagination, which means like, okay, they sense these wins, but they can also imagine, hey, if I did this, how these wins change, okay? That's an imagination, to able to predict or imagine the future. And the last thing, which is the strangest of all, is multiple personalities. Meaning that Putin and Stalin are such good men that they embody multiple personalities in them. And that's why they're so unpredictable. All right. So the example is this. Everyone says that Stalin trusted Hitler. So Hitler played Stalin. But if you just look at, if you just analyze the game, okay, then the conclusion is Stalin played Hitler. You understand? Hitler did everything that Stalin wanted him to do. Hitler invaded Poland, which caused France and Britain to declare war on him. Okay? Then Hitler attacked Soviet Russia, which brought America into the war and helped the Soviet Union become an empire. You understand? So Hitler was completely played by Stalin. And the answer is, so the question then is, how? Because in 1941, June 1941, Hitler did not have to invade Soviet Union, okay? He could have waited for Stalin to invade him. Then the opposite would have happened, right? Then America would have joined the war on Hitler's behalf. And they would have defeated the Soviet Union, okay? So what convinced Hitler to do the most insane thing and invade Russia first? And the answer is Hitler trusted Stalin. Does that make sense? So imagine this. Hitler and Stalin, they're having drinks. They're both drunk. And they're on the porch, and they're staring at the mountains and the moon. And Stalin and Hitler are talking. And all something has to do is say three words. And then Hitler is like, I'm gonna come and invade you. What are these three words? How can Stalin get Hitler to invade Russia? What are the three words that Stalin can say to Hitler? I trust you. Okay, I, Joseph Stalin, trust you, Adolf Hitler. I don't trust anyone, I don't trust my own mother, but I trust you, Hitler. Okay, then why would Hitler invade? Exactly, okay. Because Hitler thinks now that Stalin is his target, as Jacques says. Stalin is a sheep. I, Hitler, am a lion. I am a wolf. You're a sheep. Therefore I eat you. You understand? And what Stalin could only do this if he had multiple personalities. Stalin had to be a sheep in front of Hitler. He couldn't pretend. He had to be. Does that make sense? So these three things are the Russian strategic imagination, the ability to feel the political wins of the moment, the ability to prophesize and predict, the ability to be multiple individuals at once. And that's how Stalin was able to win World War II. And this is why Putin will be able to destroy the American Empire. Any questions? Okay, so Srinan asked the most important question. Why are the Russians different? Okay, all right. So the problem isn't Russia. The problem is us, the West, okay? So when we talk about the West, Western thinking, it comes from British thinking. And there are three distinct characteristics of British thinking that's different from Russian thinking. All right, let's look at British philosophy versus Russian philosophy, all right? Okay, the first major difference is that British philosophy tends to be narrow. Whereas Russia tends to be broad, okay? The reason why is Britain is an island. Therefore it thinks very narrowly about the world. Whereas Russia, it's a huge country, it's the world's largest country. Therefore it thinks very broadly about the world. And to understand the difference, What you do is you read British literature and compare it with Russian literature. Russian literature you have Leo Toystoy, war and peace, and a Korean enough. These are very huge epics. And then British literature you have, Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, they're great, but they're very narrow in their focus. So that's the first big difference. Second big difference is British philosophy believes in the idea of empiricism. And parasympathism is a philosophy developed by British philosophy, like David Hume. And the idea is we can only know what we experience. We can only know what we see. Okay? So another word for imperism is the idea of skepticism. Be skeptical of abstract philosophy. Okay? Because we can never know it. For example, you can never really understand mathematics because mathematics is beyond your experience. Okay? You can only know what you experience. And it's true, but it limits your imagination. The Russians believe in mysticism. So they're very spiritual religious people. So there are forces we don't understand. There are individuals who are prophets, who are sent to us by God. We can never know who they are. We can never know how they think, but we just have to believe that's the case. So the Russians are going to be much more mystical in their thinking than the British are. And the last thing is the British believe in logic. It's like mathematics. You can go from one to two to three to four to five. Everything has to be logical. Everything has to be connected together. Whereas the Russians, they believe in intuition. You can jump. You can imagine things. You don't have to be logical. Whereas the British say you have to be logical. And these three ideas, Nero, Empirism and Logic, they created the Western mind of today. So this is what dominates in academia. So when you go off to university, they expect you to think in this way, narrow, empirical and logical. And if you think about it, this is perfect if you wanna build a bureaucracy. Right, this is bureaucratic thinking. This is the bureaucratization of the imagination Okay, you're not allowed to Say things without evidence and logic and experience Okay, and the Russians don't have this so they can do this All right now There's obviously more good things about the system than about this system But the problem with the British system is like no great man could ever arise from Washington society. Does that make sense? Because all this creates a process- orientated systemized bureaucratic style of thinking. Okay? So for example, I give this talk, right? I could never give this talk in America or Britain because they will all think I'm crazy. Does that make sense? They're like, what's your evidence for this? What, are you refuting decades of scholarship about World War II? Are you telling me that Stalin was a genius when no one thought he was a genius? How dare you refute these thousands of scholars who have put all this work into World War II scholarship? Okay, do you understand? All right? So in the British system, no one like Putin can arise. But in the Russian system, some like Stalin and Putin can arise. The problem though is that what happens if you don't have Putin or Stalin, well then your, then this system, this system becomes very weak. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, so the British system doesn't really need great leaders. The Russian system, you do need great leaders. And if you are a great leader, then you are allowed to completely follow your intuition and imagination to do great things, like Joseph Stalin in World War II and what Putin is doing today. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Oh, that's a great question. So last semester, we said the Greeks. And the Greeks are more like the Russians than they are like the British. So the Russian system, the Greek system, it's a much more natural human system. And the British system basically, it's trying to remove intuition and imagination from the decision making process, from the intellectual process, because intuition and imagination are too mysterious. So in other words, let's just say that I'm Joseph Stalin in World War II, 1939. For me to execute my plan, I need to write a memo detailing my thinking. Now, obviously I can't do that because if I did that, first of all, I couldn't execute my plan. But second, it would confuse everyone. Like, what are you trying to do again? Do you understand? And so the Greeks believed in imagination and intuition as well, but not the British. And we live in the British system. Any more questions? So Jack asked a good question. How much did the Greeks influence the British? And the answer is not that much. Because remember, after the Greeks came the Romans. The Romans were like this. And there was a Romans who influenced the British, who then influenced Americans. So we're living basically in a Roman world as opposed to a Greek world. Does that make sense? Any more questions? So this is a really hard question. What influences Russia? Well, I mean, what the Russians will say is that they're a Christian nation, that they come from a Christian tradition. And the Christian tradition comes from a Greek tradition. Does that make sense? So Christianity, they would say that Christianity is the main influence. and there's some Greek elements to Christianity. What the Russians say is that their Christianity is a more pure or more ancient form of Christianity. We remember when we studied Christianity, Christianity changed over the centuries. So basically this is a pre-Augustine Christianity, before Augustine. Any more questions? Great, great. Next class we do the American Civil War."}

So today we do assignment revolution. Okay, and as I mentioned in previous classes It was really Dante Who helped give birth to the idea of modernity and he really launched three major movements Which include the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation and the assignment revolution. Okay, we would not have modernity without Dante Okay. All right, so let's see how the three connect together. Okay, we're gonna review the previous two classes to connect to today's class on the time revolution. So the Renaissance, what it was was it was a celebration of what makes us human. Before we were focused on the divine on the idea of God. Now we want to tell the story of what it means to be human. Okay, that's the Renaissance. Protestantism believes that we have direct access to God. The Catholic religion, the Pope is the divine representative, and the clergy is the spokesperson for God. But Protestantism believes that we have direct access to God. We should be able to speak with God directly through the Bible. The center of evolution, it's really about how can we know God? Okay, that's the idea of the center of evolution. So let's review why we have these ideas. And it has to do with Dante. So remember last we discussed the dialogue between Beatrice and Dante. Let's review it really quickly. So Beatrice is saying, I just said that God is perfect. Whatever God touches, whatever God creates is perfect. So if that's the case, why is it that there is decay, destruction and death in this world? What are the forces that give rise to this decay? And then she explains, okay, whatever God creates is perfect. So angels are perfect, they're immortal, they're eternal. But the elements that are in this world, they are not created by God. What is created by God are the divine laws that underlie the universe. God created the atoms, God created the laws that allow these atoms to enact with each other. So the rays and motion of the holy light draw forth the soul of every animal and plant from matter able to take form. So it's these divine laws that create the animals and the plants. But these divine laws also necessitate that they die in order for new forms to come into being. So this is the idea of evolution. We humans are special, why? Because we are both divine created and created by the laws of the universe. We have a dual nature. And the main advantage of this dual nature is it gives us a capacity to imagine. Remember the issue of God is that God is perfect. If you're perfect, if you're eternal, if you're immutable, you lack an imagination because there are no boundaries to you. But if you're human, you're forced to have an imagination because you'll make mistakes, you will fail. There are things that you do not know. And the imagination gives you the capacity to know this world and to perfect this world. So that's what it means to be fundamentally human. So let's recap. These are the three main messages that Dante is relaying to us through his poetry. First of all, God is within us. How do we know? Because we are capable of loving others. God is the light of love within us. The more we love someone, the more this light grows in us. So we must focus on loving someone who is dear to us. Second idea is we have the imagination and thus responsibility to discover the universal laws underlying reality. God created the laws of the universe. God created us in order to know these laws. That's very fundamental to the idea of science. The last idea is we can master these laws to better our reality. So these are the three hidden messages of divine comedy that will influence development of science in the Western world. Okay, so I wanna talk briefly about science that has been traditionally been practiced in ancient societies, okay? So in ancient societies, the major ancient civilizations are China, Egypt, and India. And you will see a lot of similarities among these three civilizations on how they practice the idea of science. It's very intuitive, it's very imaginative, it will make sense to you. So the first science that they focus a lot on is the idea of secret geometry. I'm not sure if you've heard of this, but the idea of secret geometry is that the underlying fundamental structure of the universe, of reality, are geometric shapes. And from these geometric shapes, you can give rise to every possible reality. All right, so this is called the egg of life and from the egg of life you just keep on expanding it, you'll get all of reality, okay? These are actually 3D, 4D shapes. I can't illustrate them but if you're curious, go online, these are beautiful ideas, okay? Okay So there are two possible ways to understand sacred geometry The first possible way is to understand understand as solids. Okay, so the Egyptians understood them as solids and Plato understood them as solids remember Plato a lot of philosophy is derived from the Egyptians and The idea of sacred geometry. It's very apparent in Plato's writings and he got this from the Egyptians. So basically the idea is that if you train yourself on how to understand sacred geometry and how to manipulate sacred geometry in your head you can access God. Okay? So the first idea is to understand it as solids. But there's another way you can understand sacred geometry and it's as vibrations, as energy, as a force. Okay? And this is the way that the Chinese understand sacred geometry, right, as chi as life force, also as well as the Hindus. And so imagine a monk who's breathing, okay, who's meditating. What are you doing? He's breathing and he's meditating and he's focusing his energies in order to achieve the sacred geometry within him. The monk will often say things like like, oooom, oooom, oooom. He's causing vibrations that try to mimic the sacred geometry. Why is he doing this? Because the belief at this time is that if there is a god, if there is a creator god, the question is how does it think? It's not going to think with words the way we do. It's gonna think using mathematics with sacred geometry. And by thinking, he is going to create the underlying universe. And how does he do that? He does it by breathing, breathing in, emitting sacred geometry, and then breathing out, breathing back in, okay? Inhaling, exhaling. And this will give rise to the universe. So if you're a monk or a priest, you practice meditation in order to try to mimic the act of creation. And if you are able to succeed, then what will happen is you harmonize yourself with the vibrations of the universe. And therefore, you're able to access divine energy. So that's the idea of secret geometry. And again, it's a very complicated idea, but that's a general gist. Any questions? And again, this makes intuitive sense to you. All right, the second big field that the Egyptians or Chinese and the Indians were really passionate about is astronomy and astrology. So the Egyptians basically created astrology. And the idea is that you're trying to link the movement of the stars, the cosmos, with events in the world. So by understanding the movement of the stars, you're able to divine or predict the future of humanity. Every major king had an astrologist in order to divine the future through the practice of astronomy and astrology. All right, and the last thing is alchemy. What is alchemy? Alchemy is basically chemistry and source we combine together. This is a polytheistic world. And the idea is that because it's a polytheistic world, chaotic world and somehow if you're clever enough you're able to hack this world. Okay, I think think of it as hacking that there are secrets to this world and you are able to take elements in this world combined together and create something called the philosopher's stone. The philosopher's stone is the power of God in order to give you the elixir of immortality in order to live forever as well as to manipulate the environment. So basically It's literally led into gold. And again, this was an extremely popular practice in ancient societies. So these are three major sciences in the primitive societies, China, Egypt, and India. And they promulgated outwards and influenced other societies. We still have them today, okay? There are still people who practice alchemy, geometry and astrology today. Okay? Any questions about this before I move on? Okay, so this is primitive science. So the question then is, what's the difference? Okay, so let's focus on the three major differences between pre-modern science and modern science. Okay, the first major difference is it focuses on the spiritual world, on the outer worldly. All right, and the point of science was to create harmony between our world and the spiritual world. Because if you harmonize these two worlds, you can have a more prosperous, more peaceful future. Today, we are only focused on the material world, the world that we can see and know, in order to create progress. We abandon the spiritual world, and we focus on this material world in order to manipulate it, in order to promote technological progress. And quite honestly, we have been extremely successful at that. In fact, I will argue we've been too successful at that. So that's the first major difference between premodern and modern science. Second major difference is that premodern science relies entirely on intuition and imagination. You don't do experiments. You don't have conferences. You don't debate. You just meditate. You just dream. And you often fall into trances in order to communicate with the spiritual world. In this world they use a lot of helosudinics, a lot of psychedelics, including magic mushrooms, a drink called soma, which is very important in the Hindu religion, as was the Zoroastrian It's basically a psychedelic, okay? Today, we don't rely on intuition and imagination. We think this is superstitious. We rely mainly on something called the sonic method, okay? And later on, I will discuss the sonic method more in detail, right? Now, the last thing is, in pre-modern science, people are relying on divine inspiration in order to discover the truth. the truth. The big question is what is truth? Today we care about the question how do we know truth? Okay it's really the idea of the institution of doubt. Our main priority is to question and doubt the truth. And what what what happened is because of this emphasis change, we've change from what is truth to how do we know truth, it will launch a revolution in technological progress. Alright, so underlying the Islamic revolution are three major theological assumptions. Without these theological assumptions, the Islamic revolution would not be possible. So the first and most important idea is the idea of monotheism. There is one God. And again, the very idea of monotheism is also revolutionary in human thought. Second idea is that God designed and willed the universe into being. So there is an intelligent design to the universe. And it's up to us to discover this design. endowed us with the capacity to discover his design and will. Okay? So these are the three major theological assumptions underlying the type of revolution. That is why this that is what the set of revolution happen in Western Europe and not say in China or the Islamic world or India. Okay? Because you needed these three theological assumptions. Okay. So what do these assumptions bring us. Okay, so let's look at polytheism. Again, for most of human history, most societies have been polytheistic. What is the difference between a polytheistic worldview of science and a monotheistic worldview of science? Okay, so I need you to memorize this chart. Okay, the first major difference is a polytheistic system is there's really no design, there's really no progress. It's just with chaos and struggle. But in a monophysic worldview, there is an underlying truth to the universe. That's the first difference. Second major difference is the idea of randomness. Things happen for no particular reason. If you win a lottery, that's great. But if you lose all your wealth, that's just random. It's just fate, it's just destiny. There's no purpose or no design to your fate. But in the monotheistic world, there's the idea of good and evil. Things happen to you that benefit you if you're doing good. But if you're doing evil, then bad things will happen to you. So there's a very, there's a deep sense that God is in our lives orchestrating events. The last major difference is that between fate and progress. Okay? If there's truth in this world, if there's goodness in this world, then we have responsibility to progress by doing good and by discovering this truth. Okay? That's why I keep on emphasizing this, but monotheism is really an intellectual revolution first and foremost. Okay. So the sign of revolution happens and what drives it. There are three major forces that drive the sign of revolution. The first is the idea of the Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation. So the Protestant have come in the challenging authority of the church and the church responds by, or something called the Counter-Reformation. There is this belief or this is prejudice that the church is anti-science. The Catholic Church is not anti-science. In fact, both the Protestants and the Catholic Church are trying to use science in order to promote their legitimacy and authority. So the Protestants are heavily devoted to science because they want to understand the will and mind of God. The Catholics themselves are also promoting science. The Catholics will create a new society called the Jesuits who are renowned for being great scientists. In fact, a lot of universities in this world were founded by Jesuits. A lot of Jesuits came to China and they promoted knowledge and science in China and this has been true for many centuries. So both the Catholic Church and the Protestant movement, there are in a struggle to use science in order to promote their own authority and legitimacy. That's a first major force driving the revolution. Second is war. During this time, Europe is in constant state of war. It's fighting amongst themselves between the Catholics and the Protestants. It's also fighting with the Muslims, the Ottoman Empire, which is at this point the strongest empire in the world. All right, and last idea that's driving science is the age of exploration and conquest. As Europe is trying to expand outwards, They're going to North America, they're going to South America, they need better navigation tools. They need compasses, they need astrolabs, okay? So science solves all three problems, okay? Okay, so again, the Simeon Revolution, the best way to know the Simeon Revolution is It's a fundamental change from asking what is truth to how do we know truth, okay? How can we know truth? And believe it or not, but no one really bothered to ask this question before, how can we know truth? And because science is asking this question, how do we know truth, what it's really doing is it's separating itself from religion and putting itself above religion, okay? Because religion purports to be the truth, right? And what science is saying is like, how do you know if you're right? Well, we know if you're right because we have methods to test you, okay? So science is putting itself above religion. And as you can imagine, this will create conflicts within the Catholic Church very, very soon, mainly in the trial of Galileo. Okay, so because science asks this question, how do we know truth? What it does is it creates the semantic method. Okay? An semantic method is composed of three main elements. The first is you ask questions and you propose hypothesis. So there are no questions now that are out of bounds. And you have to think of solutions and ideas to solve these questions. Okay, so that's the first step. Second step is there are these processes and protocols for testing hypothesis, experimentation basically. So only if you can experiment, only if your hypothesis matches experimental results, can it be true. Now last thing is it creates a system of doubt and criticism in order to test all experimental results. And today we call them academic societies and peer review journals. So if you're a scientist working today at a university, whatever results you have, you must first publish, and then you have to present your journal results to a conference of peers who will criticize you. And they will look for flaws in your argument. And this is an extremely effective system on how to know what is true. And again, because of the system, It's allowed for a remarkable explosion of wealth and technology and progress in the world today. And this is the chart that shows us, okay? So for most of human history, progress meaning productivity has been flat. And then starting around the year 1700, it starts to exponentially rise, okay? And this has meant that we are now able to feed more and more people. So before 1700, you really couldn't get above a few hundred million people. And now we are projected to reach nine billion people. And you can ask, this is a good thing. And I will argue it's not a good thing, but it shows us the remarkable power of science. Okay? All right. So now the question then is, what caused the Southern Method to arise? And it really has to do with a major debate among scientists. It was the dual-centric versus heliocentric debate. Okay? Now, what's interesting is that if you look at the Egyptians, they knew that the sun was the center of the universe. That's why their god was the sun god Rao. But by the time you hit the Greeks, there was now this divergence between those who believe that the universe revolved around the sun and those who believe it revolved around the earth. In about 150, a Greek scientist named Ptolemy working in Egypt, he developed the first comprehensive cosmological system. In this cosmopolitan system, which he wrote in a book called The Amygus, he made certain arguments. The first argument is that the Earth stands still. The Earth does not move, it doesn't revolve. Second is that all other celestial bodies, including the moon, including the stars, the planets, revolve around the Earth in a circular motion. Why? Because in the heavens it is assumed that everything is perfect. So for example on planet earth we breathe something called ear. Ear oxygen is what gives us life. But up there in space ear becomes ether. Ether is the ear that the gods breathe. Ether is what allows the world, the heavens to be perfect. And so, and this is the Arabic edition of the Amogus. And as you can see there, you can't read this, but there's a lot of mathematical detail in the book. And because Ptolemy's perspective, aligned with theology, the Bible, it was accepted, it was accepted true for over a thousand years, okay? There's something going on age, relied heavily on Tolerant's understanding of the cosmos. But the first person to suggest that this model is wrong is Copernicus, who is a Polish polymath. He did many things. He did astrology, he also did astronomy. And when he died in 1543, he proposed the heliocentric model. Now what's really important for us to remember is that Copernicus was a devote Catholic. And many of his friends were major figures within the Catholic Church. And guess what? They were extremely supportive of his theory. In fact, they wanted him to publish his theory. Okay, why? Because at this point, there is no conflict between science and religion. So the saying back then is it is the job of the church, the Catholic church, to tell you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go. Okay, so the Catholic church didn't really care one way. They didn't care about the theocentric model or the helocentric model. They didn't care at all. So Copernicus was heavily supported. The problem with Copernicus is that the mathematics didn't really make sense, okay? So if I put two books in front of you, Copernicus book called On the Revolutions of a Celestial Spears or Ptolemy's book, well, most scientists would tell you that Ptolemy's book is better. It's more math, it's more well-argue. And the reason why is Copernicus, his idea is new. And so he didn't have that much time to refine it. People didn't really have time to work on it. Whereas Ptolemy, a thousand people have been working it over the centuries. So the geocentric model, it is much more refined, much more accepted at this point than the geocentric model. This man, his name is Tycho Braque, and he is a Danish polymorph as well. He comes from a very noble family, and he spent a lot of his time doing observations. He collected a lot of data, he observed how the planets revolved, And his conclusion is that the geocentric and the helocentric model are both correct. And his proposal was that Earth was the center of the world, but the plants revolve around the Sun. Okay? So the Sun revolved around the Earth and every other system revolved around the Sun. Okay? So that's what he derived from his data. Now he had a prodigy named Johans Kepler. He's a German and he looked at the data and he discovered that the data actually makes the heliocentric model, actually supports the heliocentric model more than the geocentric model. And but because he is not a member of the Catholic Church, he's a Lutheran, okay? The Catholic Church couldn't really do anything about him, right? And what's remarkable about Kepler is that just from this data, he was able to make certain predictions about the stars that we've confirmed over time. The first is that the sun, so everyone revolves around the sun. His problem though is that he didn't put the sun at the center of the universe. He put something else at the center of the universe. The sun revolves around that, and the earth revolves around the sun. Second major law of planet motion is that the orbit is actually not circular, it's elliptical. That's what the data was telling him. And this goes against theology, because remember, in theology, the heavens are perfect, because that's where God lives. But Kepler is saying, nope, the orbit is elliptical. And then what else he did that was revolutionary is that he discovered that there was a correlation between this orbit and the mass of the planet. Okay? And this will give rise to Newton, but Kepler made all these revolutionary discoveries. Now comes Galileo. And Galileo, he lives in Florence at this time, and so he's under the purview of the Catholic Church. So he comes from a pretty normal background. When he grew up he wanted be a monk, but his dad wanted him to become a doctor instead. And then they made a compromise, and he said, I'll go study mathematics. But his dad was insistent that he go study medicine. Eventually, Galileo managed to go do what he wanted and just do science. At this point, they invented a telescope. And this was not a great telescope. So the telescope could give you three times the magnification of the human eye, okay? But it's not that great. But with this telescope, this new invention, Galileo did amazing things. First thing he did was he discovered that the Jupiter had moons. And this was revolutionary because it was assumed that everything revolved around a planet Earth. But now he showed that moons revolved around Jupiter. He also recognized that from the earth, you're able to see Venus spin around us. And that also was revolutionary because it was assumed that earth stood still and all the planets stood still. So he wrote this book and it was a sensation. He became like the core scientist to the Medici family and the Catholic Church thought this book was great. But the thing about Galileo, which is very important, is that he was a very arrogant man. Because he was promoting the helocentric model, he was coming into conflict with a lot of academics that were extremely well established who made their living off the geocentric model. So they have these arguments and Galileo's arguments were very limited. Remember, this is a new idea. It's really supported by mathematics. is not really supported by a lot of data. So Galileo's entire logic was, I speak to God, I know the truth, and you're all idiots. That was basically how he spoke to his enemies. And as you can imagine, he had more and more enemies. And as you can also imagine, his enemies were devising ways to get at Galileo. When did not Galileo were saying privately that he should not have been saying is that people were saying to him, listen, this hill-shifting model, it's fine, but it goes against scripture. Okay, let's look at scripture. Scripture says that the earth, it's firm and immovable. Okay, that's what the Bible says. Also, if you look at Genesis, it's clear that God created the earth first, and then He created the heavens, the sun, and the moon, and the stars. So logically, everything should revolve around Earth. So Galileo, how do you explain this conflict between your theory of the helicentric model and scripture? And Galileo's response was, it's my job to interpret scripture. And this, as you remember from last week, it's heresy. If you disagree with a church, that's not heresy. That could just be ignorance, okay? But if you believe that you are above the church, if you refuse to accept the authority of the church, if you believe that I interpret the Bible better than the church, that is heresy, okay? So Galileo was called before the acquisition. He was explained, asked to explain himself. And Galileo was pretty confident, you know? He had the support of the Medici's. He was a very famous author. He was extremely intelligent. He thought that God loved him, okay? So as you can imagine, it was a disaster. It was a disastrous meeting. The equestrian told him to shut up. You can write anything you want privately, but do not promote your views anymore. And because if you were guilty of heresy, you could be burnt at the stake, Gallaudet had no choice but to follow this order. That is until 1632. What happened in 1632? Well, the old pope died and the new pope, Urban the Eighth, came in power. Who is Urban the Eighth? Well, he was a very good friend of Galileo's. And Urban the Eighth was a huge admirer of Galileo's. So Galileo felt he now had permission to get back at his enemies. So he wrote a book called Dialogue Concerning the Two Chiefs World System. And it was basically like almost like a platonic dialogue where he presented his argument again for the helicentric model. Not only that, but he made fun of his enemies. So it's a dialogue, and the chief enemy of Galileo, his name was Simplicitus, okay? Simplicitus, Moron. Not only that, but he put into the mouth of Simplicitus a lot of the arguments from Pope Urban VIII. So he was making fun of the Pope, even though they were very good friends. So as you can imagine, the Pope was really pissed. At first he banned this book. And what happens when you ban a book? You make it into a national bestseller, okay? So everyone was reading this book. So now Urban Age was really angry, and so he called for the Inquisition. Okay, so Galileo was hauled before the Inquisition, and Galileo now had to explain himself. And Galileo was coming up with a lot of like really silly excuses. So what he said is, listen, this book, it's a sad tire. It's a thought experiment. I know like the heliocentric model is wrong. And so I wrote this book as an intellectual exercise to see how wrong it could be and to see if it could be right. Okay, so we're seeing things like this didn't work and they basically put him under arrest. At this point, Gallo's friends pleaded with the Pope and the Pope said, fine, I'm a generous person, I will commute his sentence to house arrest for the rest of his life. So that is a story of Galileo. So you can make the argument that it was Galileo's Personality that was responsible for his trial and downfall. It was his hubris. It's a very classic Greek tragedy. But historically, that's not how we remember this story. The reason why is, again, remember, there's a major conflict between the process and the Catholics. So the process will use this trial as propaganda against the church. And the process will say, you see how anti-science the church is. And Galileo will remember now as the father of modern science, because he put science above religion. And even though Galileo was disgraced during his time, eventually what will happen is the Florentines, the people of Florence, they will dig up his grave and put his body beside Michelangelo and Dante. All right, that's how they revered the contribution of Galileo. OK, all right, so again, even though the theory of heliocentrism, it is correct, the mathematics didn't make any sense. At this time in history, if you had a team of scientists go and look at the geocentric argument versus a heliocentric argument, they would say the geocentric argument makes more sense. It was not until Newton when the mathematics came into being that allowed for the heliocentric model to be widely accepted. Newton, as you know, he's the person who created calculus. The calculus you're learning in school, guess what? He was responsible for the creation of calculus. Now what's really interesting for us to know about Newton is, Newton didn't really see himself as a mathematician or scientist. These were side-hoppies. What he really was was a theologian, okay? So he spent most of his time actually reading a Bible because he was convinced that reading a Bible were the secrets of the universe. Specifically, he wanted to know when the world would end, okay, and he spent most of his life doing these calculations, and he told us that the world would probably end, I don't know, 2060, okay, 2050, 2060 around then. So he spent most of his time doing theology. This is important for us because even at this time, even as a sign of revolution, it's gaining steam, there is no separation between religion and science. People understood faith as a very important cornerstone of science. Without faith, how could you have the energy and inspiration to understand the mind of God? Okay? Newton is also famous for being an alchemist. So we spent most of his time also doing these science experiments, where he's trying to combine different elements. Unfortunately, chemistry at this point, it's very primitive. So he was taking mercury. He was convinced that mercury will lead to the plosaur stone, and he was eating it, he was tasting it. As a result, he had a lot of mercury poisoning problems. He couldn't sleep, he had delusions, his hair was falling out, he had mercury poisoning. But at the same time, he had the inspiration to come up with the mathematics to prove the heliocentric model is correct. Okay? The book he wrote is called The Principia. At this time, Latin is the universal language of scientists, right? And also, guys, at this time, they're not called scientists. They're called natural philosophers. All right? Scientists consider part of philosophy. All right. So in 1687, this debate ended with the publication of this book. Newton used mathematics to prove once and for all the heliocentric model. This is one page from the Principia. As you can see, there are a lot of mathematics, there are a lot of diagrams. In this book, you also find his laws of motions. So Newton's great insight was that the probably the loss of attraction, gravity that governs this world, probably govern the heavens as well. So before it was assumed that the heavens and the earth were separate. And now he's saying that no, these are combined together. And he created laws of plenary motion. if you figure out the mathematics that told us the relationship between the size of the planets, the mass, and how they orbited. Now the problem though, he had a huge problem. The problem is he had the correlation, he had the mathematical correlation, but he didn't know why the correlation existed. He couldn't solve the causation problem. There's just no way that God would spend his time moving the planets around. He was much too busy. So they had an underlying cause. He didn't know what it was though. And who figured it out? Well, Einstein figured it out. So at this point in 1905, we knew that there was a correlation between the size of the planet and how it moved, okay, and gravity. But we didn't know why. And it was a genius of Einstein to figure it out. Now you remember Einstein because of his famous equation, E equals MC squared. What does E equals MC squared mean? It means that mass and energy are correlated. And this is a revolution. We didn't understand this before, right? We just assumed that solids and vibrations are different. And what Einstein is saying is that in order for a solid to exist, there have to be vibrations in the first place. And this formula tells us that within all objects, there is almost an infinite amount of energy, okay? Because C is the speed of light. And why is this important? Because this formula will allow us to develop the nuclear bomb, right? By splitting an atom, you can create almost an infinite amount of energy in this world. Okay, so that's a major contribution of Einstein. But at his time, he was mainly known for figuring out the causation problem in space, okay? And how Einstein figured it out is by developing a new idea called space time. He believed that in the heavens, there was a space time curvature. And so what was happening was this, a mass, a huge object, it would go into the space time curvature and warp it. And because it warped it, it drew things into its orbit. And then these things would have to move around this solid, okay? So space time curvature now helps us understand the laws of planetary motion. First developed by Kepler and then refined by Newton. Okay? And what's amazing about Einstein is, and this is like, this will blow your mind, okay? But he did all this while sitting at a desk at a patent office in Switzerland. He was not in an laboratory. He was not at a university. He was just thinking by himself. because they dream in. So this was just an incredible achievement. And so the mathematics is very complicated. But all you need to understand is that you figure out that there's a mathematical relationship between the mass of the object and the spacetime curvature. And this formula tells us what the relationship is. And why mathematics is important is it allows us to make predictions. And these predictions will tell us if the science actually works or not. If the model, the theory makes sense or not. And so Einstein's theory of relativity, space-time curvature, it is one of the most successful models in history because it predicts the black hole. The black hole is almost solid, that is infinitely massive, and therefore it attracts everything into it, and sucks everything into it, including light. So it predicts the idea of the black hole, and we discover the black hole. So this confirms the theory of relativity. The theory of relativity also predicts the big bag, because the idea of space time is that space is in motion. That's why you have time, because it's in motion. Well, if it's in motion, then where did it start? It had to be like a starting point. And that's why scientists, not Einstein, Einstein was actually against the idea of a big bang. But a lot of scientists believe that you need a big bang. Okay? And so we have a working model of the big bang. The problem with this model is that there's actually a lot of evidence against this. Okay, so there are two examples. The first example is using the Hubble telescope, the most advanced telescope in the world, which is now in outer space. We've discovered that there are actually galaxies that came before they were due, okay? So the idea of Big Bang is that it's a massive energy explosion, and so the galaxies will develop later. But our data tells us the galaxies came before, much earlier than we expected. Okay, that's the first thing. Second problem that we have with the Big Bang model is that this universal expansion, it is not constant. There are times when it actually speeds up, which makes no sense. Why would it speed up? So this Big Bang model, a lot of scientists are now trying to re-examine it. The problem is, and this is a huge problem, is we don't have a better theory. And so to get around the problem of these, since it's mathematical inconsistencies in the model, Sinus created a new concept called dark energy. Dark energy. Now you think to yourself dark energy means we can't see it. No, that's not what it means, okay? And you're like well dark energy means we can't measure. No, that's not what it means. Dark energy means we don't know what it is. Okay, doesn't mean it exists and we can't see it. It just means we have no idea what it is. We can explain why the Big Bang is expanding really fast at certain points and really so at other points. And so we just say it must be dark energy. Okay? Doesn't make sense, guys. So dark energy is not something that you can't see. It's just something we do have no idea what it is. Okay? All right. So these are the theories, okay? But the person who was most responsible for the creation of the assignment method, his name is actually Francis Bacon. And he spent his entire life promoting the idea of sonic processes and methods. He's most well known for his book, The New Atlantis. So in The New Atlantis, which is like a novel, the protagonist, he ends up in the Oner Island where they have the most advanced science in the world. And the reason why they have the most advanced science in the world is because they turn science into a bureaucracy, a very specialized bureaucracy. So I'm not going to read all of it, but there are different offices, different bureaucracies for different functions. So for example, we have three that try new experiments such as themselves think good. These we call pioneers or minors. So you have an office, a bureaucracy, specifically to do experiments, which means that you have an office, a bureaucracy, specifically come up with hypotheses to ask questions. Also, we have three that take care out of them, direct new experiments of a higher light, more penetrating into nature than the former. These we call labs. So you have a team to actually audit these experiments and figure out how to improve them, okay? And then lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by experiments into great observations, axioms, and atherisms. These we call interpreters of nature. So these are theoreticians. They're the ones who will take this experimental data and combine it into a theory. And so, Bacon is proposing a scientific bureaucracy. And guess what, guys? We have basically achieved his vision today. The look at science today is essentially a bureaucracy. All right? Now, one of the foundations of this bureaucracy was the founding of the Royal Society of London in 1660. Why is this important? Because for the first time, scientists are allowed to present their findings before a group of peers who will question and doubt them. And this will enhance their research process. Okay, so the founding of the World Society was fundamental. As you can imagine, WorldCom next is publications, magazines that will showcase a lot of these new discoveries. The founding members of the Royal Society include Christopher Wren, who is a very famous architect, as well as Robert Dole, who is a very famous chemist. Okay, so that's a basic background into the history of the Second Revolution. Today we are asking ourselves a very deep question. So the Second Revolution separated science from religion. And there's a lot of concern that this has created a lot of ethical issues within science. So let's look at three major issues. The first major issue is the idea of artificial intelligence. Basically we're trying to create God. And that's a huge concern. What happens when the computers are much smarter than humans? Okay? Second is the idea of nanotechnology, where we're trying to go into the atomic level and change the laws of nature. Okay? We're trying to defy God. The third is the idea of genetics, where we are trying to change people's genetic blueprint so that we can have designer babies, so that babies will be free from cancer. Also we're trying to develop immortality. We're looking for the elixir of immortality. So these are three massive ethical debates within science. And my argument to you today is that this is the wrong question to ask. This is the wrong question to ask. These are not possible within the current Sandvik framework that we have today. In fact, I would need the argument that these three are essentially illusions. Hocus pocus, magic. Or you can even go as far as to say they are deliberate scams. So artificial intelligence is the example that we are most familiar with. So I'm sure you've all used chat. Is it any good? No, it's not. Will it get any better? No, it won't. But there's so much hype around it. I don't have time to go into artificial intelligence, but if you want to know more about artificial intelligence and why it's a scam, I can do so later on. Just ask me. So the real problem is this. The real problem is this. Science has become an imperial bureaucracy. That's the real issue. If you think about the world we live in today, the field that is most like the imperial bureaucracy of China is science today. Science is above nation. It is above government. It does things by itself. What science is doing? Science is promoting its own property. If there's no accountability, if there's no responsibility, if scientists don't actually have to tell us what they're doing, then it's not that they will become God. It's more like they'll become corrupt bureaucrats. Does that make sense? It's more likely that they will take these bills of dollars, the government's throw at them, and they'll just waste it all. Why? Because they can't. It's much easier for people to be lazy, greedy, corrupt than this for them to become God, okay? All right, so let me explain. Okay, so I know this is a hard idea, but genius does not come from hard work. It does not come from some process or some method. It comes from intuition, imagination, and inspiration. So remember when Einstein, he was just daydreaming his theories. Remember when Newton, he was working on theology. He was working on alchemy. And then he developed the ideas of calculus. This is true consistently throughout history. This is a passage from the book, The Cosmic Serpent by Jerry Narby. I'll just read it to you. Many of science central ideas seem to come from beyond the limits of rationalism. People do not logically deduce these ideas. René Descartes dreams of an angel who explains the basic principles of materialist rationalism to him. This is no different from Mohammed, who was met in the cave and the angel Gabriel appeared before him. It's religious. Albert Einstein, daydreams in a tram, approaching another and conceives the theory of relativity. Right? James Watson scribbles on a newspaper in a train, then rides his bicycle to reach the conviction that DNA has the form of a double helix. So what gives rise to great science, to great ideas? Well, imagination, intuition, and also faith that you are correct. Right? That's Galileo. was actually convinced that he was right even though the science was very sloppy. In fact, there's a very statement famous story where Einstein in 1930s and 40s, he was having a huge argument with scientists who were arguing for quantum mechanics, specifically Niels Bohr. So if you go look back in the 1930s and 40s and you look at the arguments, what you will find is that Einstein was very clear, was very logical and was very scientific sound. And you will find that Niels Bohr was unclear, illogical, and very sloppy with science. But Einstein was wrong, Niels Bohr was right. Today quantum mechanics is a science that underlines all the things that we have today, including the computer, the semiconductor, the transistor, the computer. So that's a really important thing we have to remember about science. At first it seems wrong, but because the people who believe in it have so much conviction and faith, they eventually triumph. So that's how science develops. This is the argument of Thomas Kuhn in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. This is a book that I highly recommend. If you ever saw this History of Science, this is the first book that you will read, because he goes into how science develops over the centuries. The central argument is that science does not develop like piecemeal and slowly and methodically, okay? It goes through revolutions and paradigm shifts. All right, okay, so I know this is gonna be a bit long, but it's really important that we read him, okay? Paradigms gain their status because they are more successful than their counter competitors in solving a few problems that the group of practitioners as come to recognize as acute. So Ptolemy, for his time, was considered revolutionary, because he solved the problem of why, why is it the moon revolves around the earth? People got a cosmology that was simple and which fit into theology. To be more successful is not, however, to be either completely successful with a single problem or not necessarily successful with any large number. So Ptolemy's solution only solved a few problems. It was not the complete solution. The success of a paradigm is at the start largely a promise of success, discoverable, inspected, and still incomplete examples. So the paradigm at first, it's actually promising, but it's not at all convincing. Normal science, the science that we practice today, consists in the actualization of that promise, and actualization achieved by extending the knowledge of those facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing by increasing the extent of the match between those facts and the paradigm's predictions and by further articulation of the paradigm itself. Okay, so this is really important guys. Science is not about discovery, it's about refinement. Does that make sense? Science will not give us new ideas, science will take existing ideas and fine tune them and it's something that we can believe and that we can use to drive technological innovation. All right, so let's look at another passage. Turn now to another more difficult and more revealing aspect of the parallelism between puzzles and the problems of normal science. If it is classified as a puzzle, a problem must be characterized by more than an assured solution. There must also be rules that limit both the nature of acceptable solutions and the steps by which they are to be obtained. To solve a jigsaw puzzle is not, for example, merely to make a picture. Either a child or a contemporary artist could do that by scattering selected pieces as abstract shapes upon some neutral ground. So this is really important. But what he's saying is this. Science today solves jigsaw puzzles. They're trying to take a larger model and fine-tune pieces that make the model much more elegant. It's not trying to reimagine the model. It's not trying to overturn the model. It's not trying to add new pieces to the model. All it's doing is fine-tuning existing pieces. It's like you take a jigsaw puzzle, and there's one, exactly one solution to a jigsaw puzzle. If you don't provide that solution, you're wrong. Okay? Does that make sense? That's what science is. Nevertheless, such a picture would not be a solution. So what he's saying is, if you come up with a new picture to the jigsaw puzzle, you might be creative, you might be interesting, you might be imaginative, but you're wrong. Scientists cannot accept your solution. To achieve that, all the pieces must be used. The plain sides must be turned down, and they must be interlocked without forcing until no holes remain. Those are among the rules that govern jigsaw puzzle solutions. So if you are a scientist working today, you're literally solving a jigsaw puzzle. The solution, everyone knows the solution. If you provide something that goes against the accepted solution, you will not be accepted. All right, so, we conclude. But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue in which paradigm should, in the future, guide research on problems, many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and the circumstances that this decision must be face less on past achievement than on future promise. The man who embraces a new paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the evidence provided by problem solving. So this is hard for us to understand. But if you are to be a true innovator, it's not that you come up with a new solution to a problem. It's that you must defy the basic premises of bureaucratic science. He must, that is, have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with few. A decision of that kind can only be made on faith. So this is why it's almost impossible to separate religion from science. If a new discovery is to be made, that person must believe that he is sent by God to tell us the truth. That's Galileo. Galileo, if you actually met the person, you would think this guy's a complete asshole. He's arrogant, he's obnoxious. All he does is make fun of you. But he's driven by a divine mission to spread the truth. And because he created this conflict with the church, it became an international controversy and that focused the attention of scientists and they tried to resolve this issue. So science, scientific innovation, genius, it's not a tea party, all right? It's a revolution. Okay, so I'm going to summarize what we've discussed. Okay? Because this was a lot. Okay, but I want to summarize what we did so that you have a basic framework to understand what I'm talking about. Because there'll be other classes on these topics. All right? We'll be discussing quantum mechanics at a future date. So I wanna make sure that we understand the argument. Okay, so our argument is this. For most of history, science was part of religion. Science was about validating this religion. But this creates a problem we call confirmation bias. Confirmation bias. Meaning that we will only look at evidence that supports our claims. And we do this every single day. Okay, we all want to be right, we all want to feel good, We all were reconfirmed and validated by the world around us. Okay? So, there's a very famous experiment called the Dunning-Kuger. You've heard of this, right? Okay, Dunning-Kuger. The Dunning-Kuger experiment. So, Dunning-Kuger were two American psychologists, and they were teaching an undergraduate class of foreign students and they made these students do two things. The first thing is they made every student take an IQ test. Okay? The second thing is they asked how they think they did on that IQ test. Were you in the top 5% or in the bottom 5%? Were you average? It turned out that once they looked at all the results, not one student predicted his or her class ranking. Those who did really well, the top 5%, it was pretty easy for them, so they assumed it was easy for everyone. So they underestimated the performance by about 10%. Those who did the worst didn't really know what was asked of them. So they overestimated the performance. In fact, those who got the most wrong were the worst students. So maybe they were the bottom 10%, but they thought they were average. And what this tells us is this. Doubt, self-doubt, it's really the mark of genius. If you're able to doubt yourself, if you're able to question yourself, if you're able to self-reflect, that's a sign of an excellent student. In fact, the best of excellent students. So the question then is, how do you take, how do you bring doubt into science? What you do is you separate science from religion and you create a bureaucracy around science in order to instill doubt in the scientific process. That's a solution proposed by Francis Bacon. And again, it is the most successful solution in human history. So the starting process is hypothesis, experiment, data analysis, replication. Does that make sense? You have your hypothesis, you then test it out. If it works, according to data, you then have to replicate the experiment to make sure that you are correct. Now, the beauty of this model is that you can actually make it into a prophecy. So each department does its own thing. And so what happens is that each department is inspecting and auditing the work of the previous department to make sure the results are accurate and correct. It doesn't make sense. And it turns out if you do it this way, well, it's revolutionary. And it explains the world that we live in today. explains why certain progress has been so fast and so remarkable these past 300, 400 years. But embedded in the system are lots and lots of other issues, which I will discuss. The first is idea of political control. It takes a lot of resources to run the system. And as a result, you can allow politicians to come in and interfere with the science. That's the first problem. Second problem is that over time, each department will over-specialize. You have over-specialization, which means that these departments are now unable to communicate with each other because the underlying assumptions of each department will be different. So if you want to experiment, we'll use a lot of instruments. All of these instruments are so complicated that normal scientists don't really understand what you're doing. So that's the second problem, over-specialization. The third problem is the idea of accountability. How do you know if each department is doing a good job or not? You can't because now they're over-specialized. The word we use is they are now a loof. So there are many problems with this system. Another problem is insularity, meaning that you have to spend 20 years in school before you could even enter the system. Insularity creates gatekeeping, which means that only if you play by the rules, only if you you embed it, you enter the system. Okay? And as a result, you no longer have any creativity. So this is a great irony of science. Science was initiated, inspired by the genius of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein. But today, science has developed to a point where it no longer welcomes Galileo, Newton, or Einstein. Einstein, okay? Why? Because Galileo is an asshole. He doesn't get along with other people. They won't let him in. Newton is crazy, right? He's alchemist. He believes that the Bible will reveal the end of the world. He's crazy. They won't let him in. Einstein is really bad at mathematics. He would fail all these mathematic tests in order to get into the system. He would probably not get into graduate school today. Right? So this is the world we live in. So don't worry about artificial intelligence. Don't worry about billionaires living forever. Don't worry about nanotechnology. Worry about the fact that we've come to a point in our civilization where we are now incapable of innovation. So that's it. Any questions? OK. I was really getting ready to push back on music. That's a lot of modern science. You brought that in very nicely. Okay. Well, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Any questions? Okay. That's fine. Okay. So, okay. Great. Okay. Okay. So, Newton. Okay. So, what do we know that Newton, particularly in the world. Okay, the reason why is this. So Newton didn't have any family. He didn't have a wife, he didn't have any children. So his entire state was left to his nephews and his nieces. Newton also left him a lot of money. These are aristocrats. Newton is actually the first commoner, the first non-royal in English history to receive a state funeral. He's the first commoner to be buried at West, Westminster at the okay. So he was a very big deal back then. And his relatives obviously were aristocrats. But the thing about aristocrats is that over time, they become poor. So and what do you do when you become poor? Well you sell off what is valuable. And so Newton's papers, Newton's papers, all his notes were auction off in like, I think the 1930s. I don't remember, okay, 1930s. And you would imagine that everyone would want these notes, right? Because they reveal genius to you. But for a reason, they didn't really sell very well. And the sell was so bad, the auction was so bad, that it was so piecemeal. And one person who bought the notes was John Keynes, the economist. And he was so excited to read the papers of Newton. He was like, oh my god, there must be so much mathematics in these papers that will lead to new discoveries, right? So when he actually read the papers, he was absolutely aghast at what he discovered. It was alchemy or spheology. And so what Newton was trying to do was he was trying to read the Bible and look for a secret code. I mean, he was crazy, okay? for a secret code within the Bible that would tell him the future. And he was actually convinced of something called the second coming. He was convinced that Jesus will return. I mean, these are all Christians at this point, right? He was actually convinced that Jesus will return. And so he wanted to know when he would return and how he would return, okay? So I think he made the prediction 2060. But I can't be sure. But he made a prediction when the world end. What's more important for us is that he became what we call a Christian Zionist. Okay? The idea of a Christian Zionist, and this is really important, is that once you predict the future and you know when Jesus is returning, you want to know how he returns. And Newton became actually convinced that for Jesus to return, certain conditions had to be met in order to facilitate his return. One major condition was the return of the Jews to Jerusalem because at this point, Jerusalem was being controlled by the Ottomans. He was actually convinced that we have to get all the world's Jews and return them to Jerusalem. The only problem was Jews didn't want to go back. And so I think Newton, and this is completely unknown about him, he's actually one of founders of a movement called Christian Zionism is let's figure out how to get other Jews to go back to Jerusalem and this will sort of process which will culminate with the return of Jesus. Okay so that's Newton and so what this tells us okay and this is also something that is really important is it was part of a secret society with John Locke and some other really important individuals In a secret society, I mean like they were considered, they consider themselves the true church, right? So Newton in his notes, he was very clear. He fought the holy trinity was nonsense. There's only one God, okay? And he was the representative of God on earth. He was here on a divine mission. So he's part of the secret society to try to achieve Christian Zionism and to discover when the second coming will happen. So he makes his prediction 2060. So whether or not Newton is correct, that's not the issue. The issue is that with his power, with his influence, he was heavily promoting Christian Zionism in England. And as we know, what will happen is these people will go to America, okay? A lot of these people who are Christian Zionists, they will go to America believing that America is the new Jerusalem. Well, and then what will happen later on is, designers will link up and they will plot to bring the Jews back to Jerusalem. And this leads to something called the Balfour Declaration, which is to say that after World War I, when the Ottoman Empire was defeated, the British Empire now gives permission to all the Jews in the world to return to Jerusalem whether or not they want to. So this is why history is so important because you cannot possibly understand what's happening in the Middle East today, but first understanding all this history. So does that make sense? Okay, great. I'm sorry, who was correct? 2016. Well, again, okay. So, so 2016, again, that's not the issue. The issue is that there are very powerful people in this world who believe in this And who believed that it is divine mission to make this come true? To use their power, to use their influence, to use their money to make this prediction come true. It's not really a prophecy, okay? It's really a plan. This is what it is, it's a plan. It's like how do we bring back Jesus? Because when Jesus returns, the world ends and everyone's happy, okay? That's heaven comes on earth. But how do we make it happen? Well, here's the plan, Christian Zionism. All right? So that's my real concern. Whether or not the world ends in 2016, I don't know. But the fact that there are really powerful people of the statute of, I think, Newton, with almost unlimited resources and unlimited power, they actually believe in this and they want to make this come true. That should be the major concern. So I apologize for going out on this tangent. Okay, but so we don't have class on Thursday, but next Tuesday we'll start the age of exploration."}

Okay, so let's review where we are. The area is 44 BCE and Julius Caesar has just been assassinated. And the three main conspirators, there are 60 senators, but the three main conspirators are Marcus Brutus, considered the leader of the conspiracy Cassius and Desmond Spudas. And after the assassinated Caesar, obviously, Rome is in turmoil. And Mark Anthony, who is currently the council or the head of state in Rome, he reaches an agreement with these conspirators. An agreement is this, Mark Anthony, who is a staunch ally of Julius Caesar, he will not seek retribution. And in return, the conspirators will declare that Caesar was not a tyrant. He did not want to become king. Okay? So a peace element was reached to avoid a civil war. The problem is that Mark Anthony was working behind the scenes to work up the Roman people against conspirators. And eventually public sentiment was so much against the conspirators that they flee to the provinces. Okay? And then Mark Anthony read the will of Caesar. Okay? Caesar's will. Remember that there's private property in Rome. And so when a man dies, he has a will, and then this will stipulates how this private property will be distributed. And there are three really surprising things about the will. The first thing is that Caesar right now is the wealthiest man in Rome. And he stipulates that upon his death, every Roman citizen will get three months of a soldier's wage. That's a lot of money, okay? That's extreme generosity. He also stipulates that a lot of his private property will be turned into public parks for the benefit of the Roman people. So this will demonstrate to his love of his people, okay? The second thing is actually more surprising. Mark Anthony believed that he would be named here to Caesar's legacy and wealth in the will. But in fact, Caesar's name is complete stranger to be his here. His name is Octavius. And Caesar named Octavius to be his adopted son. And so Octavius' name is actually Gaeus Octavius. And upon adoption of, upon his adoption, he is now named Gaius Julius Caesar Octavius. This is like much too complicated. So historians use the shorthand Octavian, okay? So we will name, now I'll name this person Octavian. And this is the historical shorthand, even though this is not his real name. So that's a second big surprise in the will. And the third big surprise is this. Caesar names secondary here. These are individuals who will inherit Caesar's property and legacy about Tavian war to die. Mark Anthony is a secondary here, but so is Decimus Brutus, one of the man who conspired to kill Caesar. Okay? So this will of Caesar's, it is shocking. And it shows to the wrong people that Caesar really loved them and that Caesar loved everyone, including the people who conspired to kill him. Mark Anthony is very upset about this will. So that when Octavian, and Octavian right now, he's only 18 years old. He's only 18 years old and he returns to claim his legacy. Mark Anthony is so upset that he refuses to meet with Octavian and he refuses to give Caesar's property and wealth to Octavian. Remember the first stipulation of the will is that every Roman citizen will be given three months of wages. And Octavian, what he does is to honor Caesar's will, he borrows money. Okay, this is a lot of money in order to ensure that every citizen got three months of wages So in this situation, okay, and this is only a few months after Caesar's death This is now a volatile game of throne situation game of thrones Mark Anthony considers himself the legitimate here of Caesar and refuses to acknowledge Octavian Octavian has returned and demands to be acknowledged as the here Okay, so that's one Conflict. The other conflict is you have these three conspirators, Decimus Buddhist, Marcus Buddhist and Cassius. And they're not in Rome but they're in the provinces with huge armies. So Decimus Buddhist, he is in Gaul, Marcus Buddhist and Cassius are in the Roman East which includes Anatolia and Syria, extremely wealthy provinces where they have many loyal of soldiers. And they understand that eventually there's a conflict coming, so they raise a huge army, about 100,000 soldiers, to prepare for the eventual conflict. And this is like the largest army ever assembled in Roman history. You also have a name Lepetis, who is a very competent administrator. And he has his own army. And he actually wanted to avenge Caesar, but Mark-Anthony stopped him. So Lepidus is also part of the equation. In the center is a name Cicero. Cicero is considered one of the greatest orators in Roman history. It was very common as part of a liberal arts education to study the speeches of Cicero. And Cicero is the last remaining optimist. When the optimists are the ones who are conservatives and who believed in the primacy of the Senate. So Cicero is right now in charge of the Senate, and everyone in this game of thrones has a different motivation, right? So Cicero, his main motivation is to maintain the supremacy of the Senate. So he wants a balance of power. So what he will do is he will play everyone off against each other in order to maintain the supremacy of the Senate and therefore his authority. Okay, that's Cicero. Octavian wants to be the here of Caesar, but so is Mark Anthony. And Lepidus also wants to be a here as well. And then on the other side are Decimus Brutus, Marcus Brutus, and Cassius, who are fighting for their own legacy. Okay? So this is the situation in 44 BCE. And it's a Game of Thrones situation. And you would expect the one who would most likely lose this game of thrones, would be Octavian, right? He's 18 years old, he's got no army, and he has no allies in Rome. What happens over the next 15 years is one by one Octavian destroys all his enemies. What happens first is that Mark Anthony goes to war with Desmond's Buddhists. But Decimus Buddhist is in charge of Gaul, and Mark Anthony wants the armies of Decimus Buddhist. So Mark Anthony marches against Decimus Buddhist, and then Cicero, to maintain the balance of power, he authorizes Octavian to raise his own army to challenge Mark Anthony. So now that war with each other. Eventually, Mark Anthony loses, and then he steals basically Lepidus' army to march against Desimus Buddhists again. And at this point, what happens is very strange. The three of them, Lepidus, Octavian, and Mark Anthony, they sit down together and they agree to share power and form their own dictatorship. This is what we call the second triumvirate. Okay? The second triumvirate is brutal. They, the first thing they decided to do is kill all their enemies. anyone who could challenge them, including Cicero, who was previously the patron of Octavian, right? So they killed about a third of the Senate and replaced everyone with, replaced the Senate with their allies. Then, Mark and the Octavian marched against Marcus, Brutus and Cassius, okay? Decimus Brutus has been destroyed. They now marched against Marcus Brutus and Cassius. And then in 42 BCE, they fight the battle of Philippi in Macedonia. In Macedonia, okay? Philippi is a city named after King Philip. And in this battle, Mark Anthony and Octavian triumph in the largest battle in history at that time. Okay? And after this battle, where Marcus Boutis and Cassius are killed, Octavian, Mark Anthony and Lippides agree to share the world. So Octavian would get Rome, Leopoldus would get Northern Africa, and Mark Anthony would get Egypt and the Near East, Anatolia, Syria. So Mark Anthony basically gets the lion's share of the Roman world, okay? And they agree to share it. Then what happens is, Leopoldus comes into conflict with Mark Anthony, sorry, Leopoldus comes into conflict with Octavian, and Octavian gives a speech to Leopoldus soldiers to all defect over to Octavian. Then Octavian comes in contact with Mark Anthony. And in 31 BCE, at the battle of, what's that battle called again? 31, Actium, sorry, Actium in Greece. It's a huge battle where Anthony's forces are aligned with Cleopatra forces against Octavian. Octavian. In this battle, what happens is basically Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, they run away from the battle where, and then they return to Exandria and then Octavian goes and hunts them down and they both commit suicide before they're captured. And then this ends in 27 BCE when Octavian returns to the Senate, the Roman Senate in Triumph and they declare him Augustus Caesar. Okay, Augustus Caesar, his name has now changed to Augustus Caesar, these consider the first emperor of Rome. So this is the brief history. Now I want to ask the question, how did Octavian, again who in 44 BC, he's only 18 years old, he has no army and has very few allies in Rome, how was he able to triumph over everyone? Okay? All right, and there are different explanations. The first you can say is just, well, he got lucky. Okay? Yeah, I know he was lucky, and that is a possibility, but you don't become emperor by becoming lucky, okay? So that's, that doesn't suffice. Second is, you can say he was brilliant. Julius Caesar was brilliant, right? King Philip of Barcelona was brilliant. These are all brilliant people. Very few people say Octavian was a brilliant person. He didn't have the charisma of Julius Caesar. His oration was good, but no one near as good as say Mark Anthony's or other Romans, okay? And it's generally agreed upon that he was a terrible, terrible military leader and strategist. He lost a lot of wars. Sorry, he lost a lot of battles during this conflict. So he was not a great military leader. So he was not brilliant. I mean, he was brilliant in his own way. He was brilliant politically. But he was not brilliant in the traditional sense. The third explanation is, well, he's just ruthless. He will do anything for power. And again, this is true. There is some truth to this. But guess what? In the Roman world, everyone was ruthless. Mark Anthony was especially ruthless. Mark Anthony killed his own wife. So that doesn't explain it. Fourth is the legions, the army. They remembered Caesar, Julius Caesar, and now that Octavian is considered the son of Julius Caesar, the legions swore loyalty to him. And that is true. But they also swore loyalty to Mark Anthony. And you can argue Mark Anthony had a stronger claim to Caesar's legacy than Octavian. So that, by itself, doesn't explain it either. Next explanation is Marcus Agrippa. And Marcus Agrippa is considered Octavian's partner. And he was considered a great general. And it was actually Marcus Agrippa, who was responsible for all of Octavian's major military victories, especially the Battle of Actium, which basically ended the Civil War. And this, again, is true. Marcus Agrippa is a brilliant military leader. But so were Cassius, Decimus. There were other good military leaders. The other issue is that in this ruthless world of Roman politics, how could Octavian trust Marcus Agrippa? And why did Marcus Agrippa stay loyal to Octavian? So these are five explanations, and there's all some truth to that. But I want to offer you today another explanation. And the explanation is this. The death of Caesar allowed Octavian to become emperor. Okay? And here's my argument. Remember last class, we said that Caesar, his greatness was in his myth-making genius. He created a myth of himself that he was a man of destiny who would save the Republic. But his myth was counter to other myths that were more dominant in Rome, especially the myth of Lucius Brutus, right? Lucius Brutus, the man who created the Republic and killed the king. And so Caesar had this great myth, but it was against other dominant myths. When Caesar was killed, it made his myth, the dominant myth of Rome. In fact, it turned his myth into reality, And it was this new reality that propelled Octavian into power. So another simple way of saying this is that it was the love of the women people that propelled Octavian into power. And we see this in history all the time. So for example, in Canada, Douglas from Canada, so am I, there's a man named Justin Trudeau. The most incompetent person, politician you will ever meet, okay? But he's prime minister, and he's been prime minister for like 10 years, right? Why? Because his father is Pierre Trudeau, who is considered one of the most popular prime ministers in Indian history, right? So it was basically people transferring their love of Pierre Trudeau onto the sun, okay? So that's one example. The other example, of course, in America is George W. Bush, right? Whose father was George H. W. Bush, who was considered a very good president. So is it, yeah, Doug? Yep, that's right. That's right, that's right. So if you think about it, politics, political change, it's really about myths, right? If you want to create political change, you have to change the myths. And new governments will create new myths. All right, great. So that's the basic thesis, okay? So let me explain it some more. Okay? So let's go back to the death of Julius Caesar, the assassination of Julius Caesar. And there were three major assassins, as I said, Decimus Brutus, Marcus Brutus, who was the leader in Cassius. And they were just the leaders of a huge conspiracy that involved 60 senators. That's about 7% of the Roman Senate. That's a lot of people, man. Right? 7% of the Roman Senate. And each of these individuals have different reason for wanting Caesar dead. So Decimus Brutus was considered Julius Caesar's most competent general. And he wanted to be agnostic as such. So you could say that Decimus Brutus, he was driven by jealousy, or maybe fortune and vision. You want to prove that he was better than Julius Caesar. So that's Decimus Brutus. Cassius is a different story. Cassius fought for Pompey the Great. And because Cassius was such a great general, Julius Caesar showed mercy to him and forgave him and made him a general, his own general, okay? So this is Caesar demonstrating his benevolence and clemency and mercy. The problem is that in the Roman world, Mercy is not considered a good thing. So by showing mercy on Cassius, Cassius could have interpreted this as Caesar showing contempt for him. Caesar didn't really see him as a threat. And so Cassius might have been motivated by a sense like desire for vengeance. Marcus Boudis is the most interesting, the most interesting person here. And actually Shakespeare wrote a play about Marcus Brutus called Julius Caesar. It was really about Marcus Brutus. It was trying to explain the psychology and motivations of why Marcus Brutus would want Caesar dead. Marcus Brutus did fight for Pompey the Great, but he's also the son of Julius Caesar's favorite mistress, favorite lover. And so Julius Caesar made a point of telling his soldiers, do not kill this guy in battle. If you see him, capture him, and send him to me. And so Marcus Buddhist was captured, and Julius Caesar adopted him basically as a son. And he basically fast-tracked Marcus Buddhist's career. And so Marcus Buddhist had every reason to thank Julius Caesar, right? But instead, Marcus Brutus becomes the main conspirator. And in the play by Shakespeare Julius Caesar, the argument that Shakespeare makes is, Marcus Brutus is driven by his own sense of virtue, okay, basically vanity. He believes or he's told that he's named after Lucius Brutus, the founder of the Republic. And therefore, he has a responsibility to say the Republic from wannabe tyrants like Caesar. And that's what drives him. What Shakespeare doesn't mention though is what Romans believe is that Marcus Brutus is the son, the biological son of Judas Caesar. Okay, so maybe there was that interpersonal dynamic where Marcus Brutus despised Caesar. Okay, all right, so it's a very complicated situation. But what unites everyone is that it's a feeling that Rome was changing too fast. So remember Julius Caesar, he did what he did in order to save the Republic, to restore the Republic. And so when he had obtained power, he was making changes that were necessary, but which changed the Roman sense of themselves. So one example is he brought in senators from the provinces. And these were aristocrats who spoke perfect Latin, but because it was from the provinces and they were foreigners, the Roman people were very upset by this, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is Caesar and corruption in the provinces. That goes against the interests of the nobility because one way for you to become rich as a noble person is to go to provinces and steal a lot of money, okay? So Caesar was doing a lot of things that were good for the empire and for the republic in the long term, but which hurt the interests of the senators and nobility in the short term. This is what caused the conflict. And because Caesar was so fast and so effective in his reforms, it not only disturbed the nobility, but also disturbed the people as well. Because Romans are very conservative. They were not used to all these changes happening so fast. And so this is what compelled the conspiracies to act against Caesar, okay? But this raises a very interesting question. Caesar is a genius, he's brilliant. How could he not see this coming, right? How could he not imagine the possibility that people were aspiring against him? And the answer, okay, and this is hard for us to understand today, but it was unimaginable that they would conspire to kill Caesar in the Senate. So there are lots of taboos in Rome. One major taboo is the idea of the promirium. The promirium just means the boundary of Rome. And the idea here is that Rome, the city of Rome, the physical geographic space of Rome, it is sacred and divine. It is protected by the gods. And therefore, you are not allowed to bring weapons into Rome. If you're a soldier, you must come in as a partisan. You are not allowed to come in as a soldier. You are not allowed to commit acts of violence within the primarium. Otherwise, the gods will spite you. The gods will take vengeance against you. So that's a first taboo. Second taboo is this. The Senate is considered the most sacred and divine space in the entire, in all of Rome. And so no one's allowed to bring weapons, no one's allowed to commit violence in the Senate. Also the Senate's laws are basically the laws of the gods. The Senate declared the body of Julius Caesar to be sacrosanct, meaning divine and sacred. You are not allowed to touch the body of Julius Caesar. Okay. The third thing is that everyone in the Senate was personally appointed by Julius Caesar. So everyone owed their good fortune to the generosity of Julius Caesar. Okay. Do you understand? It was just unimaginable for Julius Caesar to think that his friends could be expiring against him. Okay. Does that make sense so far, guys? It was beyond the imagination of Julius Caesar. But if this is true, there's something else that's true, which is that Julius Caesar did not want to become king. Because being king was the ultimate taboo in Rome. That doesn't make sense. Julius Caesar could not imagine that Buddhists would kill him because he, like all Romans, believed in these taboos. And the ultimate taboo was, one should never have a king. So he himself did not want to become king. He was behaving very arrogantly. He was behaving like a king, but he would not become king himself, because it would go against the Roman Republic. It would defy all the taboos of the Roman Republic. And also, before Caesar, There's also another dictator named Sola. An example of Sola is, he's a man who comes to power, kills all his enemies, and then he retires. He can become king, but he chose to not become king, because to become king would mean the death of the republic. And that's not taboo. That's a rubricon he refused to cross. So we can imagine that Caesar saw himself as a better Sola. As a more merciful Sola, he would not killed his enemies, he would show generosity to his enemies. And he would restore the Republic to its greatness. He would make the necessary reforms. Then he would retire and lead the Republic as it was. Does that make sense? So it was unimaginable for Caesar to think that he would be killed. And also what's interesting is, what did it happen to these three individuals after they killed Caesar. They killed Caesar because they feared Caesar would become king. But after they killed Caesar, what they recognized is they could only kill Caesar because Caesar did not want to become king. Otherwise Caesar would surround himself with bodyguards. Otherwise Caesar would not make himself available to his enemies. So upon the death of Caesar, all his enemies, Decimus, Marcus, and Cassius realized they went the wrong. But not only that, but the very attitude of the people of Rome changed, right? While Caesar was alive, the Roman people were very skeptical towards Caesar because they feared that he would become king, right? They loved Caesar, but they were afraid that Caesar was too ambitious. But upon the death of Caesar, the one people felt tremendous guilt for doubting Caesar. Doesn't make sense, right? Because it was your doubt that allowed the conspirators to kill Caesar. If all they did was believe in Caesar, they believed that in Caesar's myth that he was here as a man of destiny to restore the Republic, and that's all he cared about, he didn't want to become king, then Caesar would still be alive. Okay, and to compound the guilt, Caesar showered the people with generosity upon his death. So you can see how the death of Caesar creates this new reality where people now recognize Caesar did not want to become king. All he wanted to do was save the republic. And people are now, they're sort of paralyzed by their guilt. So the evidence for this is this. While Decimus Brutus was being attacked by Mark Anthony and the later Baratheon, Cassius told Marcus Brutus, hey, maybe we should come to this guy's aid. He's our ally. If he falls, they're gonna come after us next. And Marcus Brutus did nothing. He refused to act. All right? And the reason why is he could not act. He killed Julius Caesar because Julius Caesar was too ambitious. But if Marcus Brutus were the movies army against Rome, then Marcus Brutus is the ambitious one. He's the one who wants to become king, right? Therefore, Marcus Brutus and Cassius could only wait for their deaths. Because they're through the case to believe that Caesar wanted to become king wasn't true. It couldn't be true. And therefore, they committed wrong against Rome by killing Caesar. Does that make sense? So this explains his enemies. How about Mark Anthony? OK. So Mark Anthony had a different problem. Mark Anthony loved Caesar so much, he wanted to continue Caesar's legacy. And Mark Anthony sort of felt betrayed by Caesar when Caesar named Octavian to be the heir and not Mark Anthony. And so what does Mark Anthony want to do now? Well, he wants to prove that Caesar is wrong. Mark Anthony wants to prove that he is the rightful hearer of Caesar, and to prove so, he will continue his legacy. So Mark Anthony started to do things that were against his own personal self-interest, which ultimately led to his self-destruction. The first thing that he did was he marched against the Parthians. The Parthians are Rome's last great enemy. Rome destroyed Carthage, Rome destroyed the Greeks, but the Parthians still had an empire to the east of Rome. And Roman generals failed to make inroads against Parthia. And in fact, Julius Caesar, he wanted to basically end his life by invading Parthia. So Julius Caesar's plan before his death was to attack Parthia, conquer it, then sweep back to Europe and conquer Germany, okay? Basically conquer the whole world to prove he's better than as in the great. So Mark Endy decides that this is how he will prove he is Caesar's rightful here by finishing Caesar's legacy against apartheid, okay? The problem is Romans are not good at war against apartheids and the Persians, okay? Because the Romans are infantry focused and the Parthians and the Persians are cavalry focused, right? They have horses. So Mark only goes over to Parthia and he gets his ass kicked, all right? He gets his ass kicked. He's not Julius Caesar. He's not the here to Julius Caesar. And he falls into a major depression. He basically becomes a drunk, okay? That's his first major mistake. Second major mistake he makes is, he falls in love with Cleopatra. Cleopatra is the queen of Egypt, But much more importantly, she is the mistress of Julius Caesar. In fact, rumors were that upon his retirement, Julius Caesar would bring Cleopatra to Rome, and he would live happily ever after. That's the rumor. So Mark Anthony goes over to Egypt, and he becomes the lover to Cleopatra. Because he's trying to be Julius Caesar now. And this is a problem because to marry Cleopatra, he has to divorce his wife, who happens to be the sister of Octavian. So this causes a personal rift between Octavian and Mark Anthony. And the third thing that he does, which is what causes his demise is he names in his will that his children with Cleopatra will become the heirs to the Roman East. All the property, all that land that Mark Anthony controls will be given to his children with Cleopatra. They're foreign citizens. And also Mark Anthony does not have the authority to give that land out to his children. Only the Senate has the authority. Okay? So Octavian used the will as a pretext. to attack Mark Anthony. And he's heavily supported by the Roman people. So Mark Anthony, because he's trying so hard to escape the shadow of Julius Caesar, because he's trying so hard to prove he is the legitimate adherent to Julius Caesar, he basically self-destructs. He didn't have to do any of this, but he did. And by doing all this, it guarantees his destruction. So Mark Anthony basically self-destructs. Let's look at Lepidus. Lepidus, he is an extremely effective administrator, but he is not as charismatic and as blunt as you are Caesar. And Lepidus basically shied away. He didn't have the confidence to challenge Octavian for the ultimate power. And seeing this lack of confidence in this insecurity, his soldiers basically went off to join Octavian. And a lot of soldiers did that. A lot of soldiers that were fighting for the enemy side would just jump ship because Octavian is the heir of Julius Caesar, okay? He is a new Julius Caesar, and they all worship Julius Caesar. Now, let's talk about Octavian. Why did Octavian succeed so much? Again, he became partners with Marcus Agrippa, who was a much better general than him. But Octavian, again, he was not a good man, he was not charismatic, he was not a great general, but he believed himself to be the heir to Julius Caesar. For whatever reason, Julius Caesar believed in him. And therefore, he had a responsibility to finish the legacy of his father, which is to restore the Roman Republic. And that meant he had to do whatever sacrifice was necessary in order to do so. So the difference between Octavian and the others was he acted. He wasn't very successful, but he was willing to act, whereas Marcus Brutus was not willing to act. And when you act, sometimes you will succeed. And only as few successes will allow you to become the emperor of Rome. He was driven by the fact that he believed himself to be the heir of Julius Caesar. He was the son of Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar believed in him. Therefore, he has a responsibility to restore the Republic. And that's why he trusted Marcus Agrippa. And that's why Marcus Agrippa trusted him. They were all fighting for the legacy of Julius Caesar. And that's why ultimately the Roman people allowed Octavian to amass so much power. So remember, the Roman people have been taught to fear kings. But over time, Octavian was in power for 40 years. Augustus Caesar was in power for 40 years. Over time, he became more powerful than a king. This is what he did. He amassed all powers to himself. After he conquered Egypt, he made Egypt into his own personal property. This was his private estate. He used all the money from Egypt. Now, again, remember, Egypt is right now, and for the longest time, the wealthiest country in the world at this time. They have so much wealth. He used his money in order to have his own army. Before the Roman army was loyal to the Senate. Now because it was Octavian himself who personally paid every soldier in the army, which is now in a professional army, they're now loyal to the emperor. Okay? He took Gull, which was land that Julius Caesar basically depopulated with genocide, And he gave the land to his veterans. Okay? So basically he made the entire army loyal to him personally. So he now has the power of God. The Roman people allowed him to do that because they believed that like Octavian, sorry, like Julius Caesar, Octavian was driven by his sense of mission. His desire to save and restore the Roman Republic. But ultimately, because they believed in too much, Augustus Caesar would destroy the Republic and concentrate all power in his hands. Does that make sense? All right, any questions? Yeah? Okay, that's a great question. So why did Julius Caesar name Octavian as to here and not Mark Anthony? Okay, so Octavian is the great nephew of Julius Caesar. So Octavian was Julius Caesar's sister's great-grandson grandson, okay? And so Octavian basically grew up with Julius Caesar. Like they knew each other very well. But as Echo says, Mark Anthony is the man who is most loyal to Caesar, okay? The most trusted lieutenant of Caesar. Why didn't Caesar trust him? And the answer is Caesar as a genius, he doesn't care about loyalty. He cares about talent. He cares about ability. And Mark Anthony was a notorious hothead. He had a violent temper. He was a drunk, OK? I mean, he just had terrible personal qualities. So an example of this is while Caesar was off campaigning against Pompey, he put Mark Anthony in charge of Rome. And all Mark Anthony did was piss everyone off. He got in a fight with the Senate. He was so bad that Caesar had no choice but to replace him with Lepidus. So Mark Anthony was in Torus' hot head. He was emotionally unstable. He was emotionally volatile. And so Caesar didn't really trust him, even though Mark Anthony would give his life for Caesar. Does that make sense? So Octavian was considered much more competent, much more level headed. And Caesar was correct in his assessment, because Octavian was a brilliant political manipulator. Being an emperor is very hard. He was emperor for 40 years. So he had to balance all these different political factions within Rome. So, wait a question, Neko. Any more questions or comments about this argument? Is it all clear? Sure. Yes, that's right. Yeah. It's 13 people, but it's not exactly how it was. That's right. That's right. So yeah, I mean it was very hard to kill Caesar. So they were in the Senate, there were six conspirators. They all brought knives. They hit the knives, the daggers in the toga. They were all supposed to like lunge Caesar together. So, but only five senators, only five senators actually physically attacked Caesar. Everyone else just stood paralyzed. Because as you said, it was taboo, it was the ultimate taboo to commit violence in the Senate. So they were all paralyzed by this fear, even though they had this intense hatred of Caesar. They had, for months, imagine how they would go about killing Caesar. They had this plant meticulously. But when they came to actually actinate it out, they couldn't do it. Only five actually managed to take out their stab Caesar. In fact, the first person who attacked Caesar stood behind Caesar while Caesar was talking to the Senate. And he was shaking. And he only managed to pinprick Caesar in the back. This is where we get the idea of backstabbing from. So, and Caesar didn't really notice. He was like, hey, what are you doing, man? Caesar wasn't really hurt by this. Even Caesar, even though he was being attacked, could not imagine that anyone would be so bold enough to break all these taboos and attack him. So, I mean, it was an incredible act that forever changed woman history. It was just unimaginable that anyone could attack anyone in the Senate, physically, especially the dictator, the Julius Caesar, who was considered divine and sacred by the women people. So it was an incredible act of violence. And the only five people actually participated in attacking him. And it took a very long time because it was so hard to much of the strength to stop Caesar. And again, all these senators are like soldiers, okay? They're physically very strong. They're general, so you're usually killing people. There wasn't fear of death. It was just fear of bringing us all to the taboo of the former Senate, okay? So, thanks for that, Doug. Any more questions before I finish? Okay, so, Octavian Augustus Caesar Augustus Caesar was considered the first and the greatest emperor of the Roman Empire. And like Julius Caesar, he did not consider himself the emperor, he considered himself like first citizen, or the first man in the Senate. And his responsibility was to ensure the eternal prosperity and stability of the Roman Republic. And so towards his old age, He had to consider the public, sorry, he had to consider the problem of succession, right? He was a great emperor, but the second emperor had to be great as well. And so his solution was this. His solution would be he would adopt the most competent relative that he had to be emperor. He would create this new system where emperors would be adopted, okay? So the best man in Rome would always be adopted into the imperial throne. And Augustus Caesar had the perfect man. His name was Germanicus. Germanicus was very much like Julius Caesar. Brilliant speaker, loved by his soldiers. The problem was that he was too young, okay? Germanicus was too young, so he needed a transition. And so he appointed his stepson, Tiberius, who was pretty old at this point, okay? To be the transition. Tiberius was not charismatic, he was not very popular, but he was competent, he was a competent administrator. He'd be emperor for like five to 10 years. And then when Germanicus came of age, then Germanicus would inherit the throne. And he'd be a good emperor, and as a good emperor, you would then be able to find someone else who had good talent, and you would appoint him the next emperor. If you had this system, this system could go on forever. And so this is a Brun system. The problem was Hyperius. OK? Hyperius didn't like the idea that he could not appoint his successor. So what did he do? Well, he killed Germanicus. But not only did he kill Germanicus, he killed basically all of Germanicus' family. And not only did he kill Germanicus' family, but he killed, well he killed a lot of people, okay? And then he adopted someone named Caligula, who was Jamaica's youngest son, to be the emperor, and Caligula was a notoriously bad emperor. So this system broke down very quickly, even though Agasa Caesar, his intention was to continue the legacy of Julius Caesar and create an eternal prosperity for the Roman Republic. And by the time you got to Tiberias, the system collapsed. And you could argument that Tiberias marked the death of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire would continue for another like 300 years, but it was basically dead, meaning that it was wracked by all these internal revolt and internal tensions. And it was only because of its size in inertia that it was able to continue for so long. So we will, next class, we'll finish Rome by discussing the Roman legacy, okay? What is Rome's contribution to western civilization? And this will mainly have to do with the legacy of Augustus Caesar, okay? Any questions? Okay, all right, great. So we will continue, we will finish with Rome next class, and then we'll start Egypt, okay? And Egypt will be a lot of fun."}

Today we are doing the gunpowder revolution. Specifically, we are going to ask the question, how did Europe, starting about the year 1700, conquer the world? So after the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe became divided, very poor and very weak, compared with the rest of the world. But then starting in the year 1700, Europe very quickly, and only about 20 years time, will go on to conquer the entire world. So today we are going to examine how this happened. Okay. So before we begin, I want you guys to remember a very important concept that we have been developing throughout this course. And the concept is this. The nature of the military determines the nature of the political system in societies, in nations. Okay, so the four specific examples we've looked at are Sparta, Athens, Macedonia, and Rome. Because Sparta had a hoplite army, it became an oligarchy. Okay, oligarchy means rule by the few, the rule by the elite. And hoplites were farmers who could afford their own armor and weaponry. Athens had a navy and so it was a democracy. And the idea here is that anyone and everyone can row a boat. And if you can row a boat, you can fight a war, you can help Athens win, and therefore, you can participate in the political process. So Athens was a democracy. Macedonia, where actually where great is from, it was a cavalry-based army. And because only the nobility could afford horses, it was a monarchy. And the last example is Rome. Now, the thing about Rome that made it distinct from these societies is that it was willing to make tremendous sacrifices on the battlefield because it could replenish its soldiers with allies from neighboring nations in the Italian peninsula. And as such, it was a republic. Now the difference between a republic and democracy is that democracy, everyone has the right to vote. So the decisions are based on majority rule, okay? But in a republic, it is ruled by laws and tradition and history. So people will do what has been traditionally accepted as a norm. And as such, you can bring in immigrants into your society very quickly. This is important for us because Rome will become the model for America. Okay, America is not democracy, it is republic. A very important difference. So I want you guys to remember this idea. The military, the nature of the military will determine the nature of your political system in your society, okay? All right, so let's go over some basic military history. In Greece, when the Poles were fighting each other, in very much the same way that the warring states were fighting each other in China, the main soldier is called a hoplite. The hoplite means shield in Greek. And the thing about the hoplite that's very important is that it was a self-sufficient soldier, meaning that most of the time he was a farmer, but when there was a war he would grab his armor and a shield and his spear and he would go to war. You didn't need an economy to allow the hoplite to exist. This was a self-sufficient system. Over time, the Macedonians will take the hoplite formation and turn it into the Macedonian phallus, and the Romans will have their legion. Now the difference between the Macedonians and the Romans, sorry, the difference between this system and the traditional Greek system is now you have a standing army. These are professional soldiers that must be supported by the economy. This is cavalry, the Roman cavalry, and obviously these are nobility because only they can afford to have horses. These are the Vikings that we've studied before. Again, this is pretty self-sufficient. The Vikings are able to build their own ships very quickly and repair them, and they are able to go off in small bands. The steppe people became archers. So the Mongolians are the classic example. And again, the thing here is that these people, ever since they were born, could ride horses and shoot arrows. And that's why they were so effective soldiers. And that's why, for the longest time, the steppe's people were the dominant military force in the world. They could come in and conquer all the agricultural empires. This will include the Amnaya, which we talked about, but it'll also include the Turks and the Mongolians. In medieval Europe, they develop a new system where the knight becomes the main military force in the army. Now, the knight, as you can see, it requires armored horses and armored weapons, and this is very expensive. And so, and you have to train from an early age become a knight. And that's why you now have a system called feudalism where the entire economy revolves around maintaining knights for war purposes. Okay, this is where feudalism comes from. What makes feudalism stick is the idea of castles. So feudalism is about decentralization where the knights and the lords have control over the local territory. And there's something the king can do about it. Why? Because maybe if there's a fight between the lords and the king, well, and the king comes with his army, well, the lords can just hide in their castle. And as you can see, it's very hard to beseech and destroy a castle. First of all, there's a defensive perimeter, the moat, and then the high walls. And eventually, the king wanted to give up. So in the feudal system, the king is more like a figurehead who is appointed as maybe the chairman or the elected leader. But the king does not have that much power over the local areas. This changes in 1453 in the city of Constantinople. So for about closer 1,000 years, Constantinople was the wealthiest, most powerful city in Europe. They are the heirs to the Roman Empire. They consider themselves the Eastern Roman Empire. And they are invincible because of the high walls. Remember we talked about the Byzantine Empire before. And for about a thousand years, Constantinople was powerful because they were invincible. You cannot beseech the city, okay? And in 1453, this changes because the Ottoman Turks come in with cannons and they lay siege to Constantinople and they destroy the walls. And this was unimaginable before. And so it's gunpowder that allows the Ottomans to destroy the once impenetrable Constantinople. And this marks a revolution now in Europe. Now, people understand that you need gunpowder if you are to win wars in the future. This is a revolution now in Europe. So over the centuries, what will happen is this. Gunpowder will radically re-make the world in three fundamental ways. The first way that's important is the step people cease to be a threat. Okay? So for thousands of years, the steppes, the Mongolians, the Turks, the Amayas, they drove history because they could come in and conquer empires and establish new societies. Now with gunpowder, the cities can defend themselves against the steppe people and eventually over time the Russians will colonize the steppes and they will cease to be a factor in development of global history. So this is the end of the steps. That's the first fundamental change. Second is this will mark the beginning of Europe as the dominant global power in the world. It is China that invents gunpowder, right? About over a thousand years ago. But it is Europe that will perfect gunpowder as the ultimate military weapon. And it It will allow Europe to defeat everyone, including Ottoman Turks, including the Chinese, everyone. And the third and most important fundamental change is that gunpowder will usher in a whole society revolution that will remake the fabric and structure of European society. So I will explain all three as we move on. So these are the three fundamental impacts of gunpowder. Right, let's talk about the steps. So before we discuss why the step people, the Vikings, the borderland people, they usually tend to win out against empires, even though empires have much more resources, much more people, much more technology, okay? So this is the chart that explains why the borderlands wins out in the end. Because the borderlands have energy. The people are much more courageous, they're much more hungry, they're much more determined. Openness. Except the borderlands people tend to be much more innovative. They're opening new ideas. They don't invent things, but they take inventions and they apply it to the society. The last is opportunistic, where they will only attack you if they think you're weak. The empire has three advantages, mass, organization, and death. Death just means a lot of people, organization means essentialized bureaucracy. And then death just means that they can afford to lose a lot of battles. And for most of human history, the borderlands had advantages over the empire. But with the advent of gunpowder, the dynamic changes. So now that the empire is able to control and crush the borderlands. The main reason why is with gunpowder technology, you need organization. You need centralization. Remember before, armies were self-sufficient. You needed to go to war. You told everyone, let's go to war. And then the people who were soldiers would get their armor and they would rush to battle. That's what the Greeks did against the Persians. But with gunpowder, you need a professional army. You need engineers. You need the resources that allow you to make gunpowder. So you need specialization. With specialization, you need centralization, hierarchy, and bureaucracy. And that's what empires do very well. And the borderlands don't do this. And that's why, eventually, the empires will win out against the borderlands in the long term. All right. So there are four major gunpowder empires, Meaning these four societies are most equipped, most ready to take advantage of the gun power revolution. The first and most important gun power empire are the Ottomans, right? They're the ones who took the cannons, they're Tilleri, and they're the ones who destroyed Constantinople. And the Ottomans after that became the dominant power in Europe and the Middle East, okay? The Ottoman Empire. What made the Ottoman Empire so fierce was the use of professional soldiers called genoceries. Genoceries are young boys who are Christian, and they became slaves to the Ottomans, and they were educated to become professional soldiers. And because they're basically slaves, they owe their entire loyalty to the Sultan, the king of the Ottoman Empire. Okay? And these are professional soldiers who made very effective use of gunpowder in battle. So that's the Ottoman Empire. But then you also have the Mogul Empire, which was the height of Indian civilization. They were also for the longest time, essentialized bureaucracy, and they were also able to take advantage of gunpowder. Then you have the Safideh Empire, which is in modern day Iran. They are the heirs to the Persian Empire. And remember what you learned last semester is it was really the Persians who created bureaucracy in the world. OK. And of course, the last and arguably the most powerful of these gunpowdered empires is China. This is the Ming Empire. Remember it was China who invented the gunpowder. But what's interesting is when China invented the gunpowder, it was not used that effectively. The Chinese army used gunpowder mainly as bombs or as fireworks, as incendiaries to blow things up. Okay? It was, but because of the Islamic Golden Age and because of Genghis Khan's conquest, globalization came into being. And the technology of paper and gunpowder spread all the way to Europe. It was the Europeans who, who innovated gunpowder and turned it into a propellant. Okay? that you shoot people at, a projectile. And that's where we have cannons and muskets. And so it was the Europeans who actually invented gunpowder as a projectile. And then what would happen is the technology would come back to China, and China would adapt this into their own army. So that was a process. Yeah, so this is China and the use of gunpowder. Okay, so the paradox is this. It was China who invented the gunpowder and the four great gunpowder empires of the Ottomans, the Sapodits, the Moguls and the Chinese. But at the end of the day, it is Europe that conquers the entire world. Okay, that's the paradox. That's the mystery that we're looking at today. And so the thesis, the answer is, European nations would surpass the gunpowder empires because they would adopt a whole society approach to warfare. Okay? So what does that mean? It means that if you are to have, if you are really to integrate gunpowder into your military effectively, you need to change the structure of your society. You have to change the status quo. You have to move from a society that is heavily centralized to one that is both centralized and open as well. Okay? So I'm gonna explain to you what changes Europe had to make in order to move to become a modern military. Okay, the first change is it went from a feudal system to a nation-state system. Okay, does that make sense? Feudal is decentralized local powers. Nation-state is you have a centralized bureaucracy. Okay, you need that, and that's what Europe did. Second change is it went from a focus on villages, on agriculture, to a focus on towns and industry. Right? Because with gunpowder, you need specialized workers, you need engineers, you need iron workers, And that happens in towns and not in villages. OK? Does that make sense? Also, when you move to towns, you start to create portal capitalism. So the merchants become much more important than the bureaucrats. Because the merchants who go and procure resources necessary for a compouter. And the third major change that happened in Europe that really didn't happen anywhere else a shift in focus from religion to science. Okay, religion is asking the question, what does God want from us? How can we be a sort of God? Science is asking the question, how can we win this war? How can we make gun power much more effective? How can we kill more people? Okay, so these are the three major revolutions that happened in Europe that really didn't happen anywhere else. Okay, and when they happen in Europe, it will unleash these extremely violent and powerful revolutions as well, okay? Including the French Revolution, which we'll study, the American Revolution. And it's a bloody process that takes centuries to unfold and to develop. But it will make Europe into the dominant power in the world and it will allow Europe to conquer the entire world and force nations like China to adopt European social frameworks. Okay, does that make sense guys? Okay, so that's the main idea here. Okay, the main advantage that Europe had over the rest of the world was also its main disadvantage, which was Europe ever since the fall of the Roman Empire was always divided and poor and always fighting each other. each other. This is what the concept we use for this in our class is open, cooperative competition. This is the main driver of innovation in the world. When was China most creative during the war in the states period? So this is consistently true throughout history. Whenever a society is fractured and the different constituent parts are forced to fight each other, this will lead to massive innovation, not just in the military but in society, in philosophy, in literature. So we talked about the three revolutions in Europe that came about because of the gunpowder revolution. All right, so one thing to keep in mind is in the beginning, it was not obvious to people gunpowder was a revolutionary force. It would take centuries before societies, the military, used gunpowder as the main weapon. And the reason why is in the beginning, gunpowder was very unstable. It was hard to store, it was hard to make, and the guns that you used were too heavy. So they were only a small part of your military. Also, what's important for us, remember, is that there's always been a battle between artillery and fortification. So even though the Ottomans used a cannon to destroy Constantinople, engineers would figure out ways to better defend the city. So the first strategy against gunpowder was the idea of earthworks. And it's very simple. You just dig trenches around your city. And then therefore, the cannons cannot come into range of your city. Does that make sense? So there are different strategies you can use to negate the advantage of gunpowder. So Earthworks is one advantage. But then what they figured out was something called a star fortress. And this is another revolution in the military. A star fortress is designed differently. Most fortresses before were rectangular because they were the most intuitive and the easiest to build. But with a star fortress, you have different points in the fortress so that even if one part gets destroyed, guess what? You can fill the gaps, right? This part gets destroyed, but then you fill the gaps here. That part gets destroyed, you fill the gaps here, okay? So you basically have to attack the entire fortress at once, and most armies don't have these resources to destroy the entire fortress at once. You can only do it part by part, okay? You wanna breach the fortress, But the star fortress allows you to be resilient, okay? To be flexible. Though the word that we use for this is duck tile. Duck tile just means the resilience of materials. The gunpowder revolution will also mark radical changes in military formation, organization and hierarchy. Okay, so again, at this particular stage, Gunpowder is only a small fraction of the entire army. Most people are using spears and pikes together. They also have cavalry as well. So the problem for the Europeans is how do you best utilize all these resources in a much, in a efficient and effective manner? So this is one possibility where the pikes are at the back, the gunpowders are in the front, and the cavalry is to the wings. And this provides the most flexibility in your army. And because Europeans are always fighting each other, they're always able to figure out new strategies. This is a picture of an European army in the 16th century. So let's talk about very quickly the formation of gunpowder. How is gunpowder made? Well, gunpowder is made using three different resources, okay? They are salt pepper, sulfur and charcoal. Charcoal is pretty easy to get, okay? Sulfur you get from basically from volcanoes. And in Europe, the place where they had the most volcanoes was Italy, in Italian peninsula. So if you look at the history of Europe, most wars, the vast majority of wars were actually fought over the Italian peninsula. One, because you need sulfur for gun powder, but also because the time peninsular control trade with the rest of the world, and also because the church was there, the pope was there. Soap pepper is, the tetragole name is potassium nitrate, and it comes from manure, manure. It doesn't really grow naturally, so they have to farm it, they have to make it. And they make it basically by taking a horse manure, animal manure, and planting the ground and then farming it. So this became an industry onto itself. And salt pepper is important because as they chemically enhance gunpowder, they discovered that salt pepper should go from 41% to almost 70%. So salt pepper was the main ingredient in gunpowder. The Europeans had to figure out ways to mass produce salt pepper. And that's why they came up with these nitri, okay, or farms. Okay? And this became a very important part of European society. You also had chemists working in laboratories to better refine the technology of gunpowder. Okay? Because one huge issue of gunpowder is it's very hard to store. So for example, if it rains, guess what? No more gunpowder. So they constantly have to refine the chemical composition of gunpowder to make it resilient against rain, to make it easier to store, to make it easier to transport. There's also good possibility that along the way, the gunpowder explodes on you. So this was an absolute necessity to figure out how to better make, store, and use gunpowder. You also had ironworks, right? Because you need iron and metal to make cannons, which was the main use of gunpowder. These are foundries where they will make gunpowders. And again, this helps us explain why towns became much more important than villages, right? Because it's towns where you have the specialization going on and not the villages. The thing to remember about the early guns called the arcobus is that they're very heavy. Now these are metal, okay? So the soldier basically needs something to stabilize the gun. But even once the gun is stabilized, it's not very accurate, right? You can't, I mean, you better actually off with a bow and arrow, and that's what most people are using, bow and arrow, okay? The other thing about the arcobus and the musket is it's very, very slow, right? You have to aim it, then you have to fire it, and then you have to reload it. That could take maybe 10 minutes, half an hour, you know, like the technology will get better and better over time, but it's very, very slow. So you have two issues with the guns, the musket, the archer bus. One is that it's not very accurate, and second of all, it's very slow. So the only solution is to have mass army, to have a lot of soldiers firing at once. So you don't even care. You don't even want to aim. You just want to shoot it directly at cavalry or soldiers. And that's the idea. And that's why these armies, like the Ming and the aliments, were most able to use gun power effectively, because they could organize mass armies. So the main, one of the main innovators of gunpowder armies using some called a volley. So what would happen is soldiers were sent in line, they would come up, shoot it, then walk through the back, a new line would come up and shoot it again. They weren't aiming, they were just shooting it. And this is what we call volley fire. So this is the main tactic. So does this make sense to you guys so far? But over time, gunpowder will become much more effective, much more accurate, much faster. And now what you can do is conscript more soldiers. So in other words, what is required now is more conscripts for your army. So this is a picture of a battle. But not only that, but you need your soldiers to be obedient, okay, because you're asking them to charge into gunpowder, okay? And so, you needed to change the nature of people into basically peace-loving, pretty simple individuals who are used to freedom, to ones who were obedient, who were bloodthirsty, and who could kill other people, okay? And that's why you have now had the invention of something called schools. If you want to know where schools come from, it comes from the need to create as many soldiers as possible for your mass army. So a concept that I want to introduce you today, and we will go over a lot in this semester, is the idea of synchronicity. Synchronicity is to structure your society So the people in your society are able to follow the rules. They're able to follow the rules then your study can become much more prosperous and become better, can have more effective military. So the two classic examples in this world of synchronicity, the two societies that do synchronicity, the best are Germany and Japan. Go to Germany, go to Japan, and go on a subway. Guess what guys, even though it's really really crowded, everyone stands in line perfectly. Okay, everyone knows his or her position in the line and everyone's willing to wait in line. And that's why in the 12th century, Japan and Germany had such effective militaries. Okay, and also why they also have very effective industries, okay, schools, well, it's preparing people not just for the military, but also for the assembly line. the workplace. And again, societies that are most able to stand in line orderly will be the most effective in terms of industry and military. And that's usually the European societies and Japan as well. So again, gunpowder marks a whole society revolution, changing not just the military and how wars are fought, by changing the very nature of what it means to be human. Doesn't make sense. If you wanna know where schools come from, it comes from the need to fight wars. And again, China will adopt all these policies and social structures for itself. Let's go over some wars. So what's really important about Europe at this time and why Europe became the dominant power in the world is it never stops fighting each other, okay? It's always fighting wars internally and externally against the Ottomans, okay? So the wars between Europe and the Ottomans are called the Hungarian Ottoman Wars and this will last for about 300 years. And in the beginning, this really important is the Ottomans destroy the Europeans. The Ottomans are able to destroy Constantinople and they're able to take over most of Eastern Europe. So the Ottomans for many centuries up until the year 1700 is a dominant military power in Europe and around the world at this time. There's also something called the Hundred Years War that is fought between France and England. Let's now go over some wars and what I will do now is show you the casualty account, like how many people are killed in action. So again, as I mentioned, a lot of wars are being fought on the Italian peninsula. So the second Italian war, there's maybe 200,000 killed during this war, okay? These are soldiers killed, not civilians. But when you get to, but a few, few, few soldiers, it's 31,000, okay? And then it goes up to 30,000 and then it's 35,000, okay? These numbers are going up. Why? means the armies are getting larger, and the weapons are getting much more precise and effective. This is the reason why more people are dying. The English-Spanish War, it is really important. 40,000 people died. This is important because remember last class, we talked about how Spain is a dominant naval power in the world, and that's what allowed Spain to colonize South America. But in this war, England will destroy the Spanish Armada, the Spanish Navy. And England now will become the dominant navy in Europe and around the world. And they will maintain this position until America in World War II. So this is a really pivotal point in history, the sinking of the Spanish Armada by the English. We said this 30 years before, which was a religious war between the Protestants, Protestant Europe, and the Catholics. This will kill between 4.5 million to 8 million people over a span of 30 years. This is the worst war in Europe before World War I. So these wars are becoming much more violent, much more deadly. Spanish-Portuguese War, 80,000. Franco-Spanish War, 108,000. You're seeing these numbers go up, right? the Dutch war, 342,000. War of the Holy League, almost 400,000. This is important because this is when Europe is finally able to defeat the Ottoman Empire. This marks a radical turning point where Europe will not become the dominant military power in the world and the Ottomans will now decline rapidly. Now, you may have been asking yourself, wait a minute here. Why are all these wars being fought? And the answer is Europe is divided among different kingdoms. And the main policy of all these kingdoms is balance of power. So whenever a new power arises, the other powers get together and try to take down that empire, okay? So before Spain, then Spain was destroyed, then it was France, then it was Russia, then it was Germany, okay? So that's the idea here. Seven years war, almost 700,000. The Seven Years War is really the first world war because it's a war fought between France and England for control of the entire world, okay? It's being fought in North America and it's being fought in Europe. And almost a million people get killed in this war over seven years. French Revolutionary Wars, we'll discuss this later on, but 663,000 killed. The French Revolutionary Wars is important historically because a lot of people who fought in this war, They are not professional soldiers. They're just citizens who have revolutionary devotion and fever. They love their country. They want freedom for the country. So they take out arms, and they're able to defeat much more powerful European adversaries. So this is the beginning of what we call the nation state, when a citizen is completely loyal to the nation. We'll be talking about this later on, the French Revolution or wars. And then of course, the climax is World War I. And you get 20 million people, okay? 20 million people die in this war. So you can see how the casual rates just go up exponentially over the decades. And that just shows you how fast the Europeans are innovating, okay? They're innovating in terms of bureaucracy, meaning that they're able to tax or so this is much more effectively. they're able to conscript more soldiers effectively. They're also innovating in terms of technology because of science, right? They now have machine guns in World War I. They also have trenches. We'll talk about this later on. All right, so as I said before, the thing about Europe is that it's always divided into different factions who are always fighting against each other. And what you will see, what these maps will show you is two things. First is that the status quo is always switching back and forth between different nations. So in the beginning in 1448, the Holy Roman Empire is a dominant power in Europe with a population of 15 million people. That's the first thing I want you guys to notice about these maps. The dominant power is always changing over time. The second thing that you will notice is that even though this is really interesting, Even though these wars are deadly, they're continuous, and they become much more violent, the population of every nation in Europe goes up over time. Okay? So, 1554, the Ottomans now are in control, and they're at 24 million. The Holy Roman Empire goes on at 19 million, but France is arising, so is Russia. Okay? 1623, the Holy Roman Empire, It's still around so Holy Roman Empire and Ottomans are the dominant powers, but by the time of 1660 France actually becomes a dominant power in Europe and because France becomes a dominant power in Europe all the nations decide to Go up against France. Okay, and this leads to a series of wars 1727 France has 23 million that matches the population of the Ottomans Russia is rising now Okay? Right before the French Revolution 1780, France is now the most populous country in Europe. Okay? 27 million. The Ottomans have 26 million. Okay? And this is right before the French Revolution. 1824, the Russians are now at 49 million. They become now the dominant military power in Europe. And this will bring them in conflict with the rest of Europe. Okay? So England and Russia will fight something called the great game. We'll be going over this in a future class. So the rivalry between the United Kingdom and Russia, which still goes on today by the way. It's still going on today, the great game. Germany is now rising in 1890. This is right before World War I. So Germany now is a dominant power in Europe. So guess what happens? All the nations in Europe combine together to attack Germany. and this leads to something called World War I. Okay? All right? So that's the quick introduction to the history of the military revolution in Europe. Okay? We'll be going into specifics in future classes. All right, any questions about this? Was this clear to you guys? Okay, any questions? Okay, great question, okay? So the question is, These wars are so deadly, right? And so how's it possible for these societies to be resilient and to recover? Okay, so there are many different reasons, different factors going on, okay? But what's important is the rise of something called the nation state. Okay, so the nation state replaces the role of religion in those lives, right? before you had to sacrifice your life to the will of God, you had to serve God. Now, with the French Revolution, you now have to dedicate your life to the nation, the glory of the nation. And what does that mean? It means that you have to do whatever it takes in order for your nation to beat other nations in war, which includes working hard, making a lot of money, but also includes basically having a lot of children. And this is facilitated by the scientific and agricultural revolution. Remember, last class we talked about how, because of the age of exploration, Europeans were able to bring back the potato, corn, tomatoes, squash. These are pretty easy to grow, and they provide a nutrition for the European nations. But what's important is what's really driving the population growth is war, and the necessity for having a large population. So the government will provide a lot of policies that promote population growth. Does that make sense? We'll be discussing this in future classes. And I mean I know it's hard for us to imagine, but war gives people meaning and purpose. Does that make sense? It's like rooting for a sports team. You want your sports team to win no matter what. You're going to go and tear them on. That's what war does. War really galvanizes the energy of people. So people feel extremely patriotic during wars even though their children are getting killed. The other thing that's really important about war is that it gives people hope in the future. I know this is paradoxical, but so let me explain. If war, a lot of people die. With death comes opportunities that didn't exist before. That creates social mobility. So it's probably possible that you're a peasant, but because of war, the mobility dies off, and your son can go join the army, become like a captain or a lieutenant, come back and start his own business. And that wasn't available before, right? Because in peacetime, the social hierarchy stays stagnant. Does that make sense? So yeah, I mean like, and so if you think about it, it's because we live in a world of peace. Okay, something called the Pax Americana, the American peace. And that's why a lot of young people refuse to have children. Okay, why are young people refusing to have children? They really don't see a future. Right? It's like, I'm not gonna rise up in a social hierarchy. My kids are gonna rise up in a social hierarchy. There are fewer and fewer economic opportunities. Young old people aren't dying, okay? They're not dying. I mean, I know a lot of old people who are extremely successful and they will live over 100. They are like 90, 80 right now and they are extremely healthy, they're happy with their lives, they're very wealthy, they don't have any reason to die and they won't die. So, all that wealth becomes monopolized by old people. And so young people are like, why would I wanna have children? Why would I want to work hard? Why do I even want to be ambitious? There's no point. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay, all right. Good, great question. And any more questions before I continue? All right, so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna summarize what we learned, okay? Just so you have a clearer understanding of how everything fits together. All right, so, feudalism. What is feudalism? This is a system that was in Europe for 100 years, in something called the High Middle Ages, or the Late Middle Ages, which was maybe about a thousand, the year of Phallus in to 1400, okay, 1500, okay? So how does Phuism work? Phuism works because each part of society, it's partitioned into different lands, run by lords. Maybe Lord A, Lord B, Lord C, Lord D. And the king was more of a figurehead. And he really didn't have that much authority over the local regions, because each region has their own army with castles. It was very hard to invade every single part. And so whenever there's a war, what happened is the king says, OK, guys, we need to go to war. So A would come in with his army, B would come in with his army, then C, then D. And they would fight independently. What will often happen is that maybe C betrays the king. This will happen a lot in European history. This is how most wars are fought in the feudal era. Now with gunpowder, you need centralization. Why? Because the thing about gunpowder as I discussed Because the thing about compilator, as I discussed, is you need a huge army in order to best effectively use this compilator. So you need two things, taxation and conscription. And therefore you need a bureaucracy. Does that make sense guys? You need to resolve these two issues. You have to tax people to create a central army and you need to constrict people to fill the ranks of your army. You can only do it through a centralized bureaucracy. Therefore, at this time, historians say that feudalism transitioned into an absolute monarchy, where the king now has absolute power. Because the king, when the king, can organize a centralized bureaucracy. So now what happened is that the king would ask for conscripts from all lands to create a centralized army. OK? So what you need to do this is the nature of gunpowder. So remember before, soldiers were self-sufficient. If there was a battle, they just went and got their armor and then the sword and then they'd go off the battle. With gunpowder, you need different elements. First of all, you need material. The two main materials, sulfur and salt pepper. And therefore you needed to do trade and production. Okay? You needed to create a gunpowder economy if you are to have a gunpowder army. But you also need specialists. Specialists are just people who are able to make gunpowder and who are able to use gunpowder in battle. Okay? You need industry. Industry are people who manufacture gunpowder and manufacture cannons. You need research. And these are the scientists who help you refine gunpowder over time. Okay? You also need a bureaucracy to coordinate. And you also need a military hierarchy. Why? Because these soldiers need to be trained on how to use the guns. Okay, so you need a hierarchy to control the training of soldiers and the deployment of soldiers in battle. Okay, so I mean, like, this is very simple, what I'm doing. But as you can see, what this means is you need a, what we call a whole society approach. Okay, you have to radically transform your society so that it is all resources are directed to the use of gunpowder in battle. And the society that is most able to do this will be the most effective in war, okay? And who are the people who are most able to do this over time? The Prussians, which will become Germany and the Japanese, okay? And these are just two examples. Also the Americans as well. And they are the most effective in war, a whole society approach. Now, the question then is, well, okay, the logic here makes sense, but why is it that it's Europe that used a whole study approach and not China, not the Ottomans, not the Indians? Okay? And the reason why is whole study approach means a radical transformation of your social hierarchy and social order. That's the reason why. All right? So the three major changes as we discussed is to go from feudalism, basically an aristocracy, to a bureaucracy, a national bureaucracy, bureaucrats. So the power shifts from the aristocrats to the bureaucrats. That's one radical social change. But then you have to go from agriculture to industry, who the merchants. So now you have to give the merchants, the capitalists, trades people more power in your society. And the burqas don't want that. And then you have to go from religion to science. So now the people with the most authority in your society are no longer priests, which has historically been true, but scientists. So this is a radical social transformation that overturns the entire social hierarchy. And that's why, this is really important, this is a process that will take centuries, and which will lead to traumatic social revolution, including the French Revolution, and the American Revolutions, okay? We'll discuss this later on, okay? So that's what you have to do. And most societies are not willing to do this because they don't want to give up power, okay? It's that simple, okay? The elite do not want to give up power. Their power has to be taken away from them, okay? So let me give you an example to illustrate how hard it is to transform society, okay? All right, so let's look at China. Let's look at Europe. Hey guys. So China is one of the first societies to centralize. And when you centralize, you accumulate a lot of resources, And these resources allow you to make great inventions. And so the four great inventions of China are the compass, paper, print making, and gunpowder. These are four great inventions of China. China was the first to invent this by 100 years. So the printing press in China was maybe about the year 800. In Europe, it would be 1400. So this is a huge advantage over Europe. But these four inventions did not really impact society in China. They had no impact on society. But in Europe, when they go over to Europe, the compass will bring in the age of exploration. It will allow Europe to conquer the entire world, the age of exploration. Paper and printmaking, what does it do? It creates universal literacy. Everyone in Europe is now able to read and write because of paper and printmaking. It radically transforms the entire fabric of European society. And because we are now able to read and write, it gives rise to renaissance, the president of reformation, the center of revolution, okay? And the gunpowder allows Europe to conquer the entire world, conquest. So think about that. China was the first to invent all four And Europe was able to take all four and radically transform the society and make Europe into the dominant power in the entire world, right? So then the question then is, why is it China didn't make use of these four inventions? Just look at paper and printmaking, okay? The problem in China is that you have these confusion bureaucrats. And what is their source of power? It's the monopoly over literacy and knowledge production. So they didn't want to make it possible for everyone to read and write, because that would reduce their power over the people. Does that make sense? Same thing with the compass. The compass would allow Chinese to explore the world and bring in new ideas and new goods. The beggars didn't want that. They wanted to protect the social hierarchy. With gunpowder, yeah, it's fine, But the problem is if now everyone has a gun, they can revolt against you, right? Okay? So for China, it was much more important to maintain a social hierarchy than it is to innovate and to dominate the world. In fact, what's important first to remember is that if you give governments a choice, they would always choose to maintain a social hierarchy rather than to innovate, because that's just the easiest thing to do. But, and this is important, Europe didn't have a choice in a matter. It was a matter of life and death. You either innovate or you will get destroyed by your neighbor. Does that make sense? OK, great. OK, so we did a broad overview of the history, and we'll go into very specific details over the next few weeks. So next class will be on enlightenment, which will then give rise to the French Revolution and the American Revolution. So but this is a very broad overview. So questions guys? Yes? Yes. OK, so why did Europe innovate? OK, great. So let's look at Europe. Like let's just look at France. Or OK. Okay, so as a nation, you are under two types of pressure. External, okay? External just means Britain, Russia, Germany, Holy Roman Empire, okay? You have a lot of enemies, okay? And so you're competing against them. At the same time, that's really important. You have, sorry, internal pressure as well, okay? Because remember, what they're doing now is they're recruiting more and more people to join your army. And the general rule is that if you will fight for you, if they die for you, they also have a say in your society. Okay? Also, you need to get people to have children, to replenish your population. You need to get them to work hard. So you're always afraid of revolution, discontent, and also the idea of indifference. People don't care anymore. So you're under these two pressures. So because of these two pressures, it creates contradictions in your society. And these contradictions force you to balance these contradictions, which leads to innovation. Does that logic here make sense to you? This creates conflict and contradiction, which will then lead to innovation. And if you don't innovate, then you have a revolution or defeat. Does that make sense? If you don't innovate, your enemies will come and conquer you, or your people will rebel and overflow you. Those are the two options. So you don't have a choice in a matter but to innovate. But sometimes, the innovation can't keep up with the social change. And that's what happened in the French Revolution, which we will discuss later on, is that, okay, the government was trying to make these changes, but you have too many social classes, the emerging class, the educated middle class, lawyers, basically. You have all these different social groups now who want a greater say in government, but then you have this hierarchy of like clergy, nobility, and bureaucrats who want to maintain who want to maintain their privileges. And if you can't resolve this conflict, then the only outcome is revolution. So it's either you choose to resolve it, or it will be resolved for you. So this is a process of constant innovation and revolution. That's a good question. So why isn't this happening in China? So the first thing about China, that's it from Europe, is that China for the longest time has been much more united. And there are natural boundaries that protect China. So the sea, the mountains, the desert to the north. So China sees natural boundaries that Europe doesn't have. So from the perspective of Chinese bureaucrats, they're not afraid of external enemies. Because like Japan, Korea, they're not really threats to China at this time. the more afraid of internal revolution. So that's where the focus is on how do we maintain internal coherence. And the best way to do that is by co-opting the local elite, by bribing the local elite. And the best way to bribe the local elite is by helping them stamp out local discontent, ensuring that the people that are most loyal to you are always in power in local areas. Does that make sense? So the example is this. The example is think back to the Japanese invasion of China, World War II. You look at the KMT, the Guangming Deng, which is the dominant power in China. Japan is coming in conquering most of China, controlling the industrial heartland. And what is Jiang Jiechi doing? Does he care about the Japanese? Not at all. He cares about the Communist Party. these peasants in these caves in northwest China. Why? The Japanese are much greater military threat, but they are not a threat to the social hierarchy. You can work with the Japanese, right? The Japanese are probably willing to work with you to control China. The communists represent an overturning of the social hierarchy. Therefore, they are much greater threat. Okay, does that make sense? But that's a logic in China. Maintain a social hierarchy. If foreigners want to come and conquer China, that's fine, because we can work with them to maintain a social hierarchy. But these peasant rebels are the real problem. Yeah. OK, so that's a great question. Why is it that Chinese scientists don't last very long? OK, so I know this is hard to understand. But what trans civilisation is, it's a bureaucracy. Okay, a bureaucracy. Because a bureaucracy represents a social hierarchy. Okay, Confucianism. If the Confucian culture lives on, China lives on. So what's important is to protect the Confucian culture, which puts scholar officials, the bureaucrats at the top of society. So you can have the mongols, you can have the Japanese, You can have, I don't know, Zhu Yanjiang, who cares? The emperor doesn't matter. You understand? The emperor doesn't really matter in the system. What matters is the bureaucracy. And that has been consistent for 2,000 years. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, so the intention, the strategy is to maintain the bureaucracy, even though you may need to put in a foreign leader. Okay, in fact, you're better off a foreign leader because a foreign leader is much more dependent on the bureaucracy than maybe a local leader. Yeah, it doesn't matter. The emperor has no power because you think about it, the emperor is one person. But the information that he gets is often bureaucrats. And therefore, you can control and manipulate the emperor based on the information you provide him. So it's a bureaucracy that has all the power. And that's why China doesn't innovate. Because the bureaucracy is too powerful. Does that make sense? Great, great. Questions? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so that's a great question, okay? So the thing to feel about the European nations is that even though they're divided, they are basically one big family, okay? Like, so for example, the Germans, the Russians, the English, they were just like one big family. They were cousins of each other, but they still went to war and they still killed millions of people, okay? So how do we explain this? And the answer is, we can use game theory, okay? game theory. Native game theory is that you can be related to each other, but you're all participants in a game, in which they're gonna be one winner, right? So, you still have to think about your own survival and you can survive as long as you have the, as long as you have authority and legitimacy among your people, right? Because if they think that you are representing a foreign interest, your soldiers won't be loyal to you. They'll kill you. Does that make sense? And also, look, there's a very common, very simple example where it's very common that a king dies. And guess what? The two sons start a civil war. They're brothers. But why are they fighting a civil war? And the reason why is, this really interesting is, they represent different political factions who are all striving for power. And the suns are just figureheads for these political factions. It doesn't make sense. So civil wars are fought between different political factions and they will appoint maybe sun A to be the head. Okay, and son A, if he doesn't agree, they'll find someone else. Okay, so Evan's trying to be the top dog. Evan's, it's really, okay, yeah, so, so this theory, but the theory is called status. What we really want is status, right? And so, brothers hate each other the most because only one can have status, the other must obey. And that's why throughout history, so much violence has been between princes who are striving for this top position. So there are different theories. Great. Any more questions? OK. So let's go over the history of schooling. So the modern schooling model that we use today is from Prussia. Prussia. Schools. And so if you are a military, you need soldiers. And what you discover is if you want soldiers to be obedient, you need to train them from an early age. But normally that, but you need to separate them from their families at an early age. Okay, does that make sense? Because if they are separate from their families, they feel more anxious, they feel more stressed, they're less loved, therefore they are much willing to accept authority. And they're much willing to kill other people. So that's a basic theory of schooling. Make them obedient from an early age and separate them from the families from an early age and then train them to be soldiers from an early age. And this is a model that we adopt for today, universal schooling. And every country uses the system because not only is it good for the military, it's also good for industry, right? Companies also want this system where you go in And you work hard because you're anxious. You want to make money. You want to prove yourself. Whereas if you feel loved by your family, you don't care. I don't like this boss. I'm going to go home and be with my mother. So that's why every nation adopted the system. It was invented for the military, but it really helps with the industry. So the question then is, why did China adopt this? Well, because of industry. Because China needs factory workers. And this system gives you the best factory workers. Does that make sense? Great. Any more questions? OK, so great questions, guys. I really enjoy it when you ask questions. And they're really perceptive. And I think that by asking them, you learn a lot as well. So next class, we do the enlightenment. And this will pave the way for the American and the French revolutions. There's no class next week because of midterms, but I'll see you after the midterms. OK? OK."}

So let me start with a concrete example. I live in Canada and these past few years I've just seen Canadian society get worse and worse. Now a lot of the issue is this relentless immigration these past five years. of people have come into this country seeking a better life. Unfortunately, they congregate in only a few cities where there are economic opportunities. And as a result, housing prices have gone up, inflation has gone up, cost of living has gone up, but wages have been stagnant or depressed because of the surge in cheap labor. And in Toronto, if you're not making at least $100,000 a year, it's very hard to get by. And quite frankly, most are not making that kind of money, and most are struggling. So crime has gone up, homelessness has gone up, drug addiction has gone up. a very dire situation in Canada. Now it's easy to blame the immigrants and I don't think the reason are the immigrants. I myself am an immigrant so maybe I'm biased but I will say that we We came over in about 1983 and my dad was a high school teacher in a village in Canada. Sorry, my dad was a high school teacher in our village back in China. And we were really thankful for our opportunity to come to Canada and we felt really blessed because life back in China was just terrible. It's really hard for anyone today to imagine the poverty in China back then during the course of evolution. But let me give you a concrete example. Fifteen years ago, my dad came to visit me in Beijing when I was working as a high school administrator. And he bought an entire duffel bag, a huge duffel bag of toilet rolls, 24 toilet rolls. And the reason why is toilet paper was considered the ultimate luxury back in our village during the Cultural Revolution. And so maybe he wanted to give these toilet rolls to all the artist relatives and sort of one that he's made in Canada. Well the problem was that he had a very hard life in Canada as most recent immigrants do. He was a dishwasher for his entire life. And as a dishwasher working in restaurants and bars, he encountered a lot of racism and humiliation. So let me give you a example. One day my dad and I went to a supermarket to buy some butter. We couldn't find the butter because the Sarge supermarket was just huge. So my dad, he saw a clerk wearing his uniform, his white uniform and my dad asked him, sorry sir, do you know where the butter is? I mean, his English isn't that great though, but it was pretty easy to understand what my dad wanted. Historic clerk looks at him briefly and says, sorry, I don't work here. So that's a sort of accumulation that my dad face every day as a new immigrant in Canada who didn't have any status and whose English wasn't very good. We were very poor in Canada. We could easily qualify for welfare, but we didn't apply for welfare because we didn't know whether it existed. I remember late at night, my dad would sneak out across the street and pick up some sofas or chairs that the neighbors had discarded and they would become our furniture. My dad cut my hair. So believe it or not, but when I was younger, my hair was actually worse than it is today. And so the kids made fun of me. I had bad hair, uneven hair. My mom bought me clothes from bargain outlets, so they were crappy clothes. They weren't Nike or Adidas that the other kids were wearing. And I smell bad. So, understandably, the other kids teased me. I was very unpopular. So, I focused on school. I focused on getting out of poverty. And through hard work, I went to Yale University on a full scholarship. And that opened new doors, new vestors for me. And so, I really achieved the Hylian dream. And if it weren't for Canada, if it weren't for Yale, I wouldn't be able to make YouTube videos. So I'm very thankful for Canada and for Yale. So again, we're really thankful for the opportunity to come. But the reality is there's just too many immigrants coming into this country. And what's really happening is Even though you may have some short-term economic GDP burst, ultimately you're degrading the social capital, trust and cohesion of Canada. Ultimately, the Canadian identity has always been fragile, and all this massive influx of immigrants is making the identity much more fragile, which is in the long-term, going to affect Canada's capacity to work together, to innovate, to be resilient, to be cohesive as a society. Right now, a quarter, 25 percent of Canadians are foreign-born, first-generation immigrants like myself. So if there were ever referendum and Canadians could choose were not to join the United States voluntarily. Most of these immigrants would immediately say, let's join the United States because there are more economic opportunities. So in the long term, I don't see Canada staying together. I think Canada will maybe be dismembered by the United States and be absorbed into the American empire in the next 20, 30 years. I don't think Canada right now can be a sustainable nation. Now, it's really easy to blame immigrants for all of this. And most Canadians do, in fact, blame immigrants because that's what they encounter every day. They encounter immigrants not being to speak English, not following the rules, cutting in line. They watch the news and see immigrants committing crimes. They see immigrants, rich immigrants, buying up these expensive property and making like miserable for everyone. So it's really easy to blame immigrants. But ultimately we need to understand why this immigration is happening. And it's happening because of the baby boomers. The baby boomers want three things. They want their pensions to be paid. They want quality free healthcare. and they want the property prices to go up. Basically, they want the Canadian economy to keep on growing and growing and growing, regardless of the consequences. Now, in order for the economy to grow, there are three main mechanisms to accomplish this. The first mechanism is to exploit resources, because Canada really is the wealthiest country in the world. It has abundant, almost infinite resources, especially freshwater, which is what the world is gonna need in the next 100 years. So Canada's actually a wealthy place and they can choose to exploit and export a lot of these resources. That's the first solution. The second solution, which as much was saying the bold, is to unleash the entrepreneurial energy of the Canadian people to encourage more entrepreneurship, more privatization to reduce the regulatory state, to reduce the red tape. Okay, that's the second solution. And the third solution is immigration. Let's let in more immigrants, let's let in the rich immigrants to pour cash into the economy, let's let in poor immigrants so that they work as slave labor for Canadian corporations. So all of these three solutions, the government went with the third solution, increased immigration. Now, a lot of people out there believe that this is a conspiracy, that there's this global international conspiracy out there to dilute national identity, to destroy the idea of the nation state, to reduce the white gene pool. This is all a World Economic Forum, white replacement theory conspiracy, spearheaded by the Jews. And quite honestly, if the people in charge were this smart, were this well organized, the world wouldn't be the mess that it is today. You'd be surprised by how idiotic, by how incompetent the people in charge are. So let me explain to you why immigration is increasing, not just in Canada, but also throughout the Western world. Okay, so to understand this, we need to understand the framework of the Canadian nation. What is gonna exist and what is Canada gonna do? Well, Canada has some certain unique characteristics. First of all, it's a vast nation with almost infinite wealth surrounded by two oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic. And so Canada does not have like natural predators as they would in Europe. Canadians grew up in a time of relative peace, safety and security. The problem though is that Canada shares a border with the world's most powerful empire, with history's greatest empire, America. And so in order to prevent conflict between Canada and the United States, the last major conflict between Canada and the United States was the War of 1812. To prevent the conflict, there's almost an implicit agreement between the people of Canada and the people of America. Canadians, first and foremost, are not ambitious. If Canadians were ambitious, then Canada would be at war with America, and America would have absorbed Canada into the American Empire a long time ago. So Canadians, the first, the core characteristic of the Canadian identity is lack of ambition in order to maintain peace and stability with America. And if you're not ambitious, then you're not going to industrialize, which means that you're going to maintain and safeguard the environment. You'll use some of the environment, but you'll make sure it's self-sustaining. So in other words, Canada is almost like a resource bank for the American Empire. The American Empire, when it needs, can always draw on the infinite resources of Canada. And so because of its lack of ambition, there are two main drivers of the Canadian economy. The first, as I said, is resource exploitation, but sustainable, limited resource exploitation. But the main driver of the Canadian economy is immigration. Canada allows rich, corrupt families to come to Canada to hide their wealth. Canada also welcomes cheap labor, poor migrants like my father, to come to Canada to do all the work so that Canadians can enjoy their life on drinking beer, drinking molsens, a terrible beer by the way, by the cottage. And because of this economic framework, three major religions have developed in Canada to sustain this economic framework. The first religion is environmentalism. So Canadians love the environment. They believe it is their duty, their inherent duty to protect and love trees. That's the first religion. Second religion is multiculturalism. They believe that diversity is good mainly because white people love ethnic food. When white people think multiculturalism, they think ethnic restaurants, Mexican food, Chinatown. And so they love multiculturalism. But if immigrants become politically ambitious like the Indians, no, you can't have that. So that's why Indians are so derided in Canada because the Indians are actually politically active and effective. But hey, if the Indians stick to making samosas every day, the Indians would love them. So in a multicultural society, what's really important important is to be an open society and not have a distinct cultural identity. And this has created a lot of problems in Canada. It will create further problems in Canada. And the third major religion is bureaucratism, right? Because if you don't have your own ethnic identity, if you don't have a core ambition, then you need a regulatory state, a bureaucracy in order to maintain them together. You need people to tell you what to do. And Canadians worship authority. Canadians are extremely obedient, Canadians believe experts know everything. So because of these three religions, there are three distinct characteristics about the Canadian individual. What are Canadians really good at? Well the first thing is Canadians are really good at following the rules. From birth Canadians believe that they must obey the rules. The worst thing that can happen is if they break a rule. Second thing that the Canadians are really good at is being polite to other people because in a multicultural society you don't want to offend everyone. But I will say that I have noticed in my most recent trip to back to Canada, Canadians are no longer so polite. They're much more passive aggressive than before because of the dire economic situation that Canada is in right now. And the third thing that Canadians are really good at, in fact probably the best in the world at is being mediocre. Canadians absolutely have no ambition. In fact, they hate ambition. I remember in high school because I was poor and I wanted to go to Yale, I was extremely focused on grades. And so my teachers, the word they used for me is ambitious. I'm an ambitious individual. That's essentially a curse word in Canada. But I will say this, Canada, I mean, if you can just conceptualize heaven on earth, it would be Canada, right? Extreme wealth, extremely generous government benefits. No one will go poor, no one will starve in Canada. No wars, just complete peace. It's almost heaven on earth. And here is an opportunity for people to achieve eudaimonia. Eudaimonia is the Greek term for flourishing. Here is opportunity for Canadians to contribute intellectually development of humanity because they have the resources, they have the time, they have the security. No one else does. And so you would expect this tremendous outpouring of human creativity in Canada in these past 50 years. In reality, Canadians have for the past 50 years chosen to shut off their brains. Canada is an extremely complacent nation. It's almost like everyone's on Prozac or something. This is Prozac nation. So Canadians are extremely mediocre. I think that after Canada becomes dismembered and joins the American Empire, maybe a generation afterwards, Evan's gonna forget Canada ever existed because Canada has made absolutely no contribution to the world. Canada doesn't really matter in the world and Canadians are very happy to not matter in the world. So now we can understand if your three religions are environmentalism, multiculturalism, and bureaucratism, well then there's only one solution for you, right? Because you can't exploit resources because of your religion of environmentalism. You can't encourage entrepreneurship because of your religion of bureaucratism, right? You don't wanna reduce the regulatory state. You don't wanna promote individual initiative. So the only solution available to you is mass immigration. Okay? And again, a lot of it is just driven by the baby boomers. So now let me explain to you why baby boomers suck. And they suck for three main reasons. The first is that they're the most selfish generation in human history. Second is that they're gonna be the longest living generation in human history. And the third is that they wanna maintain the empire. All right, so let me go through each one by one. Baby boomers are selfish. Everyone knows this. They had the most luxurious life. But the problem is that if you always lived a life of comfort and security and prosperity, you become a selfish individual because you think you deserve all this. The other thing is that baby boomers have a religion. And it's an ethos of achievement and accumulation. the more the better, the bigger the better. The more money I have, the better. The longer I live, the better. I need to accumulate and accumulate and achieve and achieve in order to signify my value, my worth. And their greed, their selfishness, it's destroying the environment, it's destroying the economy, and ultimately it's gonna kill the children. Okay, so that's the first thing. baby merce or extremely selfish. And that by itself is not really a problem. The problem is they're not dying. And I can understand why, okay? Because at home, I'm living with my dad. And my dad is in his early 80s. And as I said previously, he's had this terrible life. 10 years ago, he got diagnosed with Parkinson's. Five years ago, he had a bad fall while using the bathroom, and now he's paralyzed. And we really fought five years ago, that was it. He had a few months to live, but he's still going. And so he has Parkinson's, he's basically paralyzed, and he's living his best life. All his life, he's worked slave wages, minimum wage, and now he's collecting a virginus pension from the Canadian government. It's free money for him. He has access to the best healthcare. Honestly, if we had to pay for the healthcare, we couldn't afford it and he would have died five years ago. But not because it's all being paid by the Canadian government. He spent six months at a really nice hospital with his own room. Every day, a physical therapist comes to the house and helps him regain some muscle control and does some cleaning for him. And really it's his best life and in his house, he has his own house and because of all this immigration, he's seen the property value go up. He's seen himself getting wealthier and wealthier. If you're a baby boomer who's been taught that what matters is achievement and accumulation, why would you give up now, right? As your life gets better and better, why would you give it up now? So even though he's bedridden all the time, I see him cling to life. And I can understand why because he's been through so much crap and now he can really begin to enjoy himself This is really heaven on earth for him So he doesn't want he doesn't want to die. Okay, but it's not just him It's the entire generation of baby boomers Millions and millions of them and in Canada they're they're a quarter of the population So they control all the political power. They control all the wealth and therefore they can dictate government policy I have a friend in New York City, a very famous person, extremely wealthy, like tens of millions of dollars and she's 90 and she has Alzheimer's and she can't walk, most of the time she's sleeping, she's semi-comatose basically. And I thought, you know, any day now she could die, but I've been thinking that for the past 10 years. And one day I asked my cousin who's a doctor, listen, if you're nine years old and you're senile, you have Alzheimer's, you can't get out of bed, but you have unlimited wealth, how long can modern medicine keep you going? Like how long can you survive? And she has like four full-time caregivers to make sure that she's taken care of. And my cousin, the doctor said to me, she can go on for another 20 years at least, another 20 years at least. So these baby boomers aren't dying, okay? So the baby boomers have captured all the wealth of society and they refuse to share any of it because of their achievement at those and they're not dying. So, but then there's actually a much bigger problem which is that baby boomers are wedded to the idea of empire. Last year I was in Brooklyn, visiting some friends. I got invited to a party And this party was full of China experts. So apparently every China expert in the world is from Brooklyn. So after COVID when they were forced out of China, they all returned to Brooklyn. And so I met all of them at this party. And I was talking to one lady, very wealthy, comes from a very powerful family. And she was a baby boomer. And I discussed with her, We're talking individually, one on one. I said to privately my fears about the American political system. I said my fear is that given the trajectory of American foreign policy, which is like extremely non-existent, I said there's a danger that America could be fighting wars on three major fronts. America could be fighting simultaneously Russia, Iran, and China. And then she looked at me and said, that's fine, we're America. We're the indispensable nation. We can do this. We can take on all three and defeat all three. Does not matter. That's the arrogance of empire. All right, so let me give you an image of what empire is. And for this image, I'm gonna draw on the play, the back high from Ubedes. If you have not read Ubedes, you must read Ubedes. One of the greatest playwrights in human history. So he wrote the play The Back High about the year 400 BC. This is like after the Peloponnese War, when Athens, the Athenian Empire, which had become basically a mafia state, basically decided to go to war against the entire world and thousands and thousands of the young people died in these wars of empire. And so, Yubridis wrote the Bacchai almost as a critique of empire. And so, the ending of the Bacchai goes like this. There's a religious festival in the mountains. And these women are all drugged out. They're hallucinating. And as part of the religious festival, they sacrifice a man who's the king of thieves, Pantheas. And so, what they do is they capture him, they rip him apart. they physically rip him apart. They rip up the limbs, they rip up the legs, they dismember him. And the person who rips off his head is actually his mother, Agave. And after she does this, she becomes ecstatic. And she ticks the head and she runs back to the city of Thebes. And we proclaim to the citizens, look at what I've done. And she's holding the head of her son, Penteous in her right hand and she's saying to everyone, this is a lion's head. You see how brave, you see how powerful, you see how virtuous I am for fighting a lion and ripping his head off. And then everyone looks at her aghast. They don't believe that she can't see the truth. And so finally her father, Katmiss, has to tell her, I gave you. That's not a lion's head. the head of your son. So that's what an empire is. Okay. If you want to know what an empire is, remember the image of a mother holding the head of her son and proclaiming the world, look how brave, powerful and virtuous I am. An empire is a system where the old sacrifice the young for their glory. That's what an empire is. And that's what the baby boomers want. They grew up in a time of the Paxa Americana. They don't want to see it die in their lifetimes. They rather burn down the entire empire. They rather sacrifice their own children and their grandchildren than to lose the idea of empire while they're alive. So that's why the baby boomers have basically told the American government to launch these wars around the world to save the Pax Americana because that's the system they grew up in. That's a system they want to die in. The Pax Americana, the Anglo-American empire. They want to feel virtuous, powerful, and strong. Okay? And they don't care if they have to burn down the world in order to do so. And so the question then is, what can we do? Well, you think about it, there's nothing we can do because as I said, the baby boomers are the most prominent political group in the Western world. They control the political system. They control the financial system. They can control the cultural system. They and there are parents. Little people, we love and honor and cherish. I'm gonna say to my father, hey dad, you're paralyzed, your life doesn't have any meaning anymore. And maybe it's time for you to rest in peace. And so that the rest of the world, the young can have their place. So one metaphor that I think best describes the world we live in is rat utopia. Rat utopia are series of experiments conducted by James B. Cajun in the 60s and 70s. And this was a time of growing abundance in the world. And this, this is the first time in human history when we escape scarcity, the promise scarcity. So we want to, to, um, look at what would happen if we looked, if we lived in a world of abundance. So it created these experiments, these colonies, where rats were allowed to live in a world of abundance. There were no predators, there was unlimited water and food. And what happened each time he did this experiment? No matter how he tweaked the experiment, the result was the same. What happened was the social hierarchy that governed the rat colony collapse and Kahun causes the behavior sink. And very quickly the rats start to cannibalize each other, they start to engage in all sorts of brutal activities. And as a result everyone died out. Okay, so no matter how James B. Kahoon constructed this experiment, ultimately it led to the collapse of the rat colony and the extermination of all the rats. And he struggled with this all his life and he could never really find the answer as to why this was happening. And the only thing that he could hypothesize is, maybe water can be infinite, maybe security, food, luxury, maybe all of them can be provided infinitely. One thing that is not infinite, one thing that is a zero sum game is the idea of status. And we are ingrained, or sorry, the desire for status is inherent to us. We strive for status. So normally in the state of nature, rats will fight each other for status. And the rats who lose, they'll run off somewhere else and they'll build their own colony or they'll get killed by natural predators. But in an enclosed environment where the rats can't run off somewhere else, then they're forced to constantly fight each other over and over again for status. Peter Turchin, the social scientist, has a concept for this. It's called elite overproduction. society's collapse over time because too much elite is being produced and ultimately they will fight each other for the limited positions of power and status. And so we're living in rat utopia. And quite honestly, this is why young people now refuse to have children. It's not just because the economic opportunities for young people are very limited, are very pessimistic and they are, the real reason is the baby boomers refuse to give their status. Think about the politicians in Washington DC. I mean like many of them, their brains aren't functioning and they're still there. And so we live in a time of rat utopia. But again, these people are the ones who gave us birth, the ones who nurtured us, the ones who we must honor and cherish. So we can never ever blame the baby boomers for what's going on. We blame the immigrants. We blame the Jews. We blame the state or blame Trump or blame Justin Trudeau. We never blame the real culprits who are the baby boomers. So the question then is, what can we do? So I think the only thing we can do is tell the truth. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our children to let them know the truth. It was not the immigrants who destroyed the West, it was not Putin or Trump or Trudeau who destroyed the West, it was not the Jews. It was us, because we became selfish, lazy and corrupt. lazy and corrupt. That's the real reason why the West is dying and the real reason why no one can do anything about it. Because we refuse to admit the truth to ourselves. But the least we can do is tell the truth to our children. And that's why I do what I do. Okay, so again, apologies for today, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I said doom and gloom. Next week, we go back to the regular programming of just cheer. Okay, no, I'm not going to ever be optimistic about the world because there's no reason to be optimistic about the world. Okay, so next week, I'm gonna preview the next academic year of classes I'll be teaching. I'll be teaching three new classes, the secret history of the world. So I'll be going into the nexus of finance, intelligence, and religion. It's gonna be a really interesting class. I'm really looking forward to teaching it. I'm really looking forward to sharing with you. I'll also be teaching the great books. I'll also be teaching game theory. Okay, so in my next video next week, I'll be sharing with you, previewing and previewing these three classes. If you like what I do, if you please support my work by supporting me on buying me a coffee, the link is below. If you want to be part of my community, the Product of History community, please join my Discord server. This week, I've started a sub stack. And if you want to join my sub stack, the link is below as well. So in my sub stack, I'll be going into solutions for how we can rebuild a better world, how we can work together to build a better world after the world collapses. Okay, that's it for today. I'll see you guys next week. Thank you so much for today, and I look forward to next week."}

Now, I've been overwhelmed by the positive response online on YouTube. So thank you so much for watching this channel and leaving comments and subscribing. I really appreciate it. It's just positive feedback for the work I do. So there's been a lot of questions online about this class and who I am. So I'm going to do two separate videos. The first video is I'm going to introduce you to some of my students, Echo, Amber, and Siti. And then in another video I'm going to talk about myself. Okay? This video is really about my students and their impressions of this class and how it has benefited them. I'm not I'm not free to tell people what the school is, okay? because this is in China and there are certain things that I say in this class that are sensitive so I do not want to get my school in trouble so we will not mention the school in this video but my students will tell you about their impressions of taking this class okay so my first question is for Siti now Siti was my class not this year but last year so last year there's a different version of this class where the first semester I taught the great books since the last time I talked to your politics. Okay and Sizi has an interesting background because you were Germany for a few years and your father is professor of Inner Con at Tsinghua so you've encountered this sort of teaching before. Okay so my first question to you is let's talk about the great books. What were your favorite great books and why were they such and why did you enjoy them so much. Can you speak a little Mike please? So two of the most memorable books I can think of are the Iliad and Dante's Inferno. I really liked the Iliad already before the class where I had read a simpler version since it's a really popular book and there has been many adaptations over the years but in this class was the first time I really more in depth looked into the content of it and I think that this class provided me a lot of new insights into the book and the kind of different backgrounds especially also into the culture of the time with the king and small kingdoms and cities and things like that. I remember afterwards we had also looked at taking a look at the Enya, the Enya being of course from the wrong period a very different period which also took inspiration from the Indian and it was really interesting seeing the contrasting cultures of both the Greek and the Roman culture especially with in this class I had already encountered the Indian as well before but in this class we also talked about how much the Indian was taken as a propaganda piece at the time so that was also really interesting to see and this is the Dantas Inferno I had heard about it quite a lot of many times before but never really had the chance to look into it so I was really happy when we decided to start reading it and taking such an in-depth look into specific parts of the book was really, really fun. So I want to ask you about these books. How do they change your understanding of yourself and your relationship with the world? Do you think? So a few key theories, ideas that I remember from last year's, that the idea of game theory and the idea of imagination. So in both of these books, the idea of imagination is really important. For example, with the Ilya, I remember it was one of the first big works of imagination that we really have, where it developed imagination over the times afterwards a lot, with such a very description of a story. It really pushed people to the limit of what they could imagine, and it really changed them. So it was really interesting learning about that. And it definitely changed my view on how people perceive the world around them, and how we for ourselves, for example, have very different perceptions of everyone around us. Of course, there's also the idea of game theory, where everyone does things according to certain situations and conditions that they face. And it really helps you think about why certain people do something and why certain conditions exist. Yeah. So, is it fair to say that reading these books have made you more curious about the world and have made you more observant about the world around you? Yeah. I would definitely say that it's made me more curious. I've already initially had a big interest in literature and ancient history. So these books kind of re-sparked this enthusiasm of learning more about it. I afterwards also looked a bit more into these books myself and even looked into a bit surrounding books. So it was really helpful in like expanding my horizon in this topic. Okay. Thanks so much. So, Echo and Amber are in my class this year. And this year, we did something crazy and insane, which is we just did entirety of human history, right? We went from the Ice Age up to today, which is the American Empire. So, I wanna ask you both, okay, Echo and Amber. The first question is, how do you feel about history now that we've covered all the major episodes of human history? And second of all, how has learning history changed your understanding of the world we live in today? Okay? So these are two big questions. You can answer one or both. I think what this course really gave me a lot of insight on was like how there are things, certain things that we take for our branches that are kind of changed or challenged in this course. Like for instance, I remember the very first class that we did was on like how humanity transition from the hunter-gatherer to an agricultural society. So that idea of the agricultural society being more stable is the modern view on this issue that we often take for granted. What we've learned from this class is that religion actually has a lot of influence on this transition. like how setting that down was like really beneficial for practicing the legends and the rituals and as a huge factor that shaped this transition. So I think my understanding of history has been challenged quite a lot in ways in this course in terms of, it challenges me to think deeper into the things that we viewed from a modern society or like a view that we take around it. Great. Thanks, Somi. Thank you. Thank you. OK, my turn. I think for the first question, what is the history that we learn from this class, I think firstly is that for the education except the formal and my middle school or something else, history is more like about what happened before and simply the events, the time, the person. But I think in this course it's more like an intersectionality between the politics, economic, and civilization, culture, stuff like this. And actually, when you see the complexity of the civilization, and also what I wanted to also credit to echo what's saying is that a very, very important insight from this history class is that the power of religion, or saying that, not maybe particular, a religion with ritual, with doctrine, but more like how belief is impact to the people, to the community, to the society. And also to talking about what changed my mind, I think a very important part is that history is not linear. Sometimes it's not being like always been improved. And it's actually more about people's will, belief, their choice, out of the current situation, And let me think about, especially I wanted to talk about a very, I think, significant class. It's about the Inca empire is that you mentioned about, we learn from the past. We learn from the mistakes we have made. So I think from this point of view, I'm more thinking about history is a book about making mistake and we learn from the experience instead of to say that history is always been grand, excellence and... Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. So, great. Thank you so much. My next question is I want you to reflect and think back to this course, this one year, okay? And tell me at one point what did I say or what did I teach you that was like more shocking to you and when you heard it you were like you were kind of stunned or shocked and this is do you have a moment like this during this course when I said something you're like this is just completely shocking and bewildering to me How are you, Eiko? Yeah, for me, that goes back to the class when we talk about religion. One idea that you mentioned was like people are, like all human beings are fundamentally religious. And that was like quite shocking because like for me, I kind of like, I don't personally believe in any religion and I kind of reflecting on like my own life, religion seems like pretty far away and like it's quite being deniled by our society right now. By learning about the history of the Greeks and the Romans and all that kind of stuff, like what I realized is that the most creative societies were those that praised the poets and all those theaters the most. And that's like how the great celebrated Homer and like that's really the part that makes us human. And so going back to the idea of being religious, that idea is kind of denied in this modern society, which values rationality over these fundamental aspects that makes us human. And so like we read part of the poems and like the literatures. And that really makes me, a veteran like resonates with me in terms of like after such a long time in history, but that connection and the motion that we share as human beings are just irreplaceable. Great, thank you so much. Amber? Mm-hmm. I'm like, very agree with what Echo said because religion, or is it religious belief, is like a very, lots of a percentage in our course. And one argument is very insightful for me during the classes that people actually sometimes want to live in a dream instead of to face the reality. I think this actually explains a lot of my like, confused to, like my confusion to the past or saying to my life in other aspects. And also, like another point, point is that when you talk about lots of like celebrity in the history you would think you would state that there are sometimes their internal logic is to make them becoming the gods. This is also a kind of like a very very new way to interpret these people's their logic and strategies because as I close out we are living China we don't have like a very united religious belief so these these stuff are usually being like far from our life, but from such kind of like a lecture, I think it actually let me know more about, even though we seem to transform to like more in a society where we're actually still using a lot of the experience from the past, we are still credits or say respect to the history, even sometimes we're not aware of. Yeah, so you said something really important, okay? I wanna paraphrase what you said. The idea that you present is maybe in China we are too utilitarian and so that prevents us from achieving greatness. If you look at all the people we've studied before like Napoleon, they achieved greatness because they want to be God. They had faith in themselves and they were achieving these grand visions. And maybe in China we lack these sort of people and we lack that to the spirit. So what I can directly think of when thinking of Shroud King ideas is that when we were reading the India through the whole reading of it, I actually thought it was quite a nice book, in contrary to what I ended up on. Throughout the book it seemed pretty normal for me, but at the very end in the very last lesson about it I remember that you told us about how it's actually a piece a propaganda from the Romans to implant these ideas of duty and things like that into the readers minds or the audience's minds and right there and then I realized a lot of the things are truly were happening throughout the entire book where for example the main character just has this motivation of for the greater good instead of for himself which loses him his personality in this in his pursuit of these goals. And I think it's really important of these things where we, in the beginning, don't see past certain ways of propaganda, if you would say so. And I think it really was a very shocking moment for me where I realized throughout this entire period of reading this book, it was right in front of our eyes, but because it was so well hidden, it was just so hard to notice. So it was a really, really big part that I still remember today. Great, thank you so much. So as a teacher, I just feel so gratified that you've enjoyed this course. And also, I can see that it's changed all of you for the better. It's made you more curious. It's made you more observant. It's made you more critical. And you're able to take these ideas and reflect back on your society around you and question it further, okay? Which was my objective to begin with? So I feel extremely gratified. Thank you so much. Now another question is, there's lots of people online who are just curious. You guys are Chinese students, you're actually Chinese students. City is going to Germany for university, Amber and Echor are going to America. So people want to hear, you are the future of China. What are your plans? What do you want to study in university? What do you want to do after university? How do you see your career trajectory and your life trajectory? So maybe we'll start with Echor. I'm going to Cardinic College in the United States. So get Cardinic, say hi. OK. Yeah, like, and this is September. And I applied as an undecided major because I want to explore more, especially history, sociology, and maybe psychology in all these areas. Especially in this class, what I think It's really valuable is that you took multiple perspectives in viewing history as a whole, like how geopolitics impacts his historical development and some of the psychological aspects as well as a lot of interconnected disciplines. So I really wanted to explore more about them. So I'm not sure what my major will be. Poor cancer, poor cancer. I'm going to New York University for liberal studies. So say hi to Amber. Say hi to... New York City. So the program I applied is basically about the all about liberal arts and humanities. So I have already registered for courses about like antiquity and writing and also history and politics. So this class is preparation for? Yes, definitely for college. Yeah, and for future plans, actually, quite a nerve, because I haven't participated to the college yet. But definitely, I would still want to do something for my hometown and society, and whatever, because besides a fan of history, I'm also a feminist, and they all know that. So I might do something for feminism, gender studies and also with like history and humanities. I think this is the part that we are currently not very valuable or encouraged in Chinese society and I hope it can be a light again. Great, thank you. So I'm thinking of going back to Germany, but since applications are finished yet, I'm not quite sure where I'll be going, but it's probably in the state of I am planning on either studying history or philosophy. I think I'm going to likely pursue it as far as I can, maybe into a PhD. And for future plans, it's going to be a long time still, so I'm not that sure yet, but I am hoping that since culture and education is very different from China to Europe, especially Germany. And I think it's important to have a combination of cultures to be able to see things from very different perspectives. So I possibly will return to China with the knowledge I've gained in Europe. And it's not really about imposing Western ideas on Chinese society, but rather a combination of it. And maybe it will help with having more different views on society and different issues. Okay great so fantastic okay I mean just hearing your answers I know all three of three of you will be very successful in university and you will achieve all that you aim for you guys are smart observant hard-working you guys are gonna be very successful in life all right so I have to leave faith in all three of you okay my last question And it's a hard question. And feel free, you don't have to answer it, okay? But I want to answer this question because I think a lot of people online are just curious. How do you see the state of the world and society today? And you talk about the world in general, you talk about America, you talk about China, okay? But what are some issues and concerns that you have about what's happening in China, what's happening in the world, what's happening in the United States? So you don't answer this question because I need to hard question. But does anyone want to try? So looking at current politics, which is very complex at the moment, but I feel like there's a lot of similarities to what has happened in the past. I haven't taken this year's class, but I feel like it's similar to what I've heard, where history teaches a lesson about things to us. And I think that, for example, right now, there's a lot of similarities to what has happened previously in the build up to certain conflicts in the world. And I think that it is important for us to be able to recognize these patterns of where conflict is on the horizon and to either decide to change things a bit to prevent these or to approach these conflicts in a better way. Because, for example, with the politics currently in the US or the politics over here in Asia. There's a lot of power relationships that are similar to both the start of World War I and World War II and the conditions during the Cold War, which of course have been in the past century, but it's still the same different political ideologies, kind of similar political ideologies, allying with each other and kind of having this rivalry on a global stage with each other. So I think it's really important to recognize these patterns being surfacing again and with the increase in conflicts globally I think it's really important that we as a society watch out to what is happening right now. So one thing I taught you last year that you've internalized is the idea that there are structures and forces to the movement of politics, geopolitics and if we study the structural forces we have a better understanding of what's happening but also we can better influence what's happening. So thank you, okay? Do any of you also want to comment? How do you view the world? Yeah, like what are issues that concern you about the world today or in the society today? You talk about feminism. So what is about China you think that you're concerned about and you want to focus more about in the future? Society and the world? I think one thing I actually observed from this course is also a sighting is that the world is more brutal than I thought. But also, as we have mentioned in the class, I think civilization is a cycle. I think there's no need to be too worried about the world or the politics because we are always in a point of the natural cycle. we were in the process and I think we definitely can learn something or say that ask for some hints from the past from history so that's I think they also the meaning of continue learning and you're talking about feminism I I'm curious about such topic more from my family actually not about the lots of like a big picture. So I think for the world is sometimes I should firstly focus on individual, focusing my own heart and find about the answer of myself and then to interact with the world. And also as for China, I think the social issue I think is we are firstly we are lack of a believe, maybe not particularly about the religion, but I feel sometimes people are very lost. And the second one is that I think we still want to live in the dreams of how to let the people more trying to wake up and face the reality. I think it's a quite like difficult mission that we need to explore in the future. Okay, so I want to thank you because I've heard two things, okay? The first thing is by taking this course Even though history is depressing You still feel empowered because you feel like the answers lie in history If we can study history deep enough, we can understand the present when impact the present positively so so you know a lot of things we discussed in this class are extremely pessimistic and and depressing, you still have, it still gave you a sense of like individual empowerment and agency. I mean that's the first thing. Second thing is, I think taking this course, I made some other factors as well, but you feel as though that you as an individual can have a positive impact on society if you engage in a process of deep learning for yourself and in a process of educating others. So that's what I heard, okay? But thank you, okay? Yeah, for me, problems are issues that I am personally pretty concerned with, like education in China. Because currently we live in a highly rational and utilitarian society. So especially in international schools as well as traditional high schools in China, people take a lot of tests and do a lot of, recite a lot of stuff and things like that. And that kind of diminished the parts where people feel that connection with the reality. And so what I've learned from this course is that when we discuss a unit about the Viking society, so one thing that's pretty impressive to me was that the Vikings spent a third of their wealth like a funeral. So what does that mean is that there's society values a lot about stories that they pass from generation to generations. And that emotional part was kind of diminished by the utilitarianism in our current world. So I think, especially from my personal experience, courses like this one and study of history has been kind of devalued in this, especially when technologies like science were like the dominant trend. And I'm not saying that this is bad or anything, but it's like, it kind of makes us internalize that there are sort of problems that we don't really wanna look into. And people don't really realize, especially. Okay, so, Enkel, I think no matter what you do in life, you're going to be a very passionate educator. And it could be a professor, it could be a researcher, it could be a teacher, it doesn't matter, okay? But I think like just hearing you speak, your students are going to love you and you're gonna have a huge impact on your students, okay? So thank you. All right, so for me, this was a fantastic conversation because this is actually the first time this year I had a chance to talk to students and get some feedback. So I think it's really gratified, I thank all of you, all three of you. And I hope that we can stay in touch. And I think that for my YouTube audience, this was actually extremely enlightening because now for the first time, they can see my students and they can see what Chinese students are like. And I think people on YouTube will be very impressed by all three of you. And I hope that we can stay in touch. And maybe we can do a follow-up session a year from now or two years from now when we're back in Beijing together and I have a chance to ask you about your university experience and how this course has prepared you for university. So thanks so much, and we'll see you in time too, okay? Okay. Thank you. Bye."}

Julius Caesar is considered the greatest historical figure of all time. He's also one most controversial, okay? So today we're gonna look at three questions about his life and I want to provide an argument about his life, okay? So the first question we're gonna look at is, what did he want? What were his motivations for what he did? Did he want to become a king of Rome? Or was he trying to save the Roman Republic? So this is a historical debate that's been around for us for about 2,000 years, and no one has resolved it. Second question I want to look at is, why was he so successful at what he did? I mean, he was a man who basically took on the Roman Empire, and he won. So how was he able to accomplish so much in only 55 years? And the last question is, why did they kill him? Because he was killed actually by his friends, by his allies, by people he grew up with, by people he fought wars with, by people he pardoned and showed mercy and generosity too. So why did they kill him? All right, so my central argument to you today is that Julius Caesar was so successful because he was a myth maker, a myth maker. A myth maker are individuals who changed the course of human history because they see themselves as a man of destiny who must change the world for the for the better. And they do so by constructing a new reality that begins to absorb the old reality and alters it. Okay? And they do so through their words, their speeches, their writings, and through their actions. So they see themselves as the main character, the protagonist, in a novel that they are writing. So this is a hard concept to understand, but let's use some examples to better understand this concept. So the first example, let's look at is the idea of Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an entrepreneur, but he was first and foremost of myth maker. So Steve Jobs, the joke about Steve Jobs was, Steve Jobs had a secret weapon. It was called a reality distortion projector. Basically, Steve Jobs lied to people. But he lied to people in such an appealing manner, in such a beautiful way that it changed the reality. Basically, Steve Jobs imposed his reality onto others. And today, that's why we use Apple computers, right? We all have Apple computers. Why do we do this? Because we are participating in the myth that Steve Jobs created for us, right? that if you use Apple computers, you are using the most advanced technology and you are participating in a pleasing lifestyle. So it's about technology, but it's also about lifestyle, it's also about attitude. And that's why we are all using Apple computers today because we are trying to participate in this myth. Another example is the idea of movies. These are reality creation machines. When you go see a movie, it's a really good movie, it will stick in your mind, and it will change the way you perceive reality. Okay? So, someone like Julius Caesar, what he was trying to do in his life was create a new narrative that would redefine reality. The last example I wanna use, and I'm really sorry for using this example, is Donald Trump, right? Because Donald Trump wants to make America great again. And so, for his speeches and for his actions, he's trying to construct or conceive a new understanding of America that absorbs the imagination of everyone around him. Does that make sense? That's what a myth maker is. And that's why ultimately Julius Caesar was so successful. Okay? But the problem with being a myth maker is by creating new myths, you are disrupting old myths that people rely rely on for their understanding of the world. Okay? You're creating something called cognitive dissonance. And people don't like cognitive dissonance. It makes them uncomfortable. So they killed Julius Caesar because his new myth of Rome was surpassing the old myth of Rome. and that made the old guard uncomfortable and that's why they had to kill him. All right, so that's my argument to you today. All right, so now that I've made the general argument, let me provide some historical background so we understand the historical context that Julius Caesar was operating in. Okay, so let's go back to 216. Last class we talked about 216 BCE and this was the Hannibal invasion of Rome. And remember at the Battle of Cannae, Rome lost about 20% of its adult male population. And at this point, Rome should have surrendered or negotiate peace terms. But Rome instead chose to fall on. And it fall on because it had a mythology about itself that was based on three principles, right? The three principles are piety, liberty, and republica. And because of these three principles, every Roman felt he or she had to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save Rome. And so everyone made a sacrifice. The rich made sacrifices by basically paying for the war. Also the rich freed their slaves so that slaves could become citizens in order to fight for Rome. The poor also made a lot of sacrifices because they had to fight in the army, but also because the way the women decided to defeat Hannibal, and it worked, is something we call a scorched earth policy. Scorched earth policy. Basically make the land unfarmable. So then your army has no access to food. Okay, and that's how they ultimately defeated Hannibal, because they burned all the land and they couldn't grow food on the land, and so Hannibal's army could not feed itself. So everyone made the ultimate sacrifice. The rich fought, the rich and the poor fought alike. The rich paid for the war, the poor lost their land. And this is all possible because of the nature of Rome at that time. Remember, Rome at that time was poor, very small place, where we knew each other, And ultimately it was threatened with existence. Hannibal proved to be an excellent threat to Rome, and that's why everyone became united and made the ultimate sacrifice. And for Romans, this was the finest hour. This was the moment they celebrated when the very existence was threatened by Hannibal, But they came together and made ultimate sacrifice and ultimately defeated Hannibal. The problem was this, the problem was like after Rome won the war, the question then is who got the rewards, right? Everyone made the sacrifice, the poor lost their land, the rich lost their money. And because the rich controlled the government, remember Rome is republic, it's not a democracy, It was decided the rich would get most of the rewards of the war. In fact, the poor got very little. So an example here is the idea of common land. Common land is what do you do with the new territory that you conquer in Spain and from the Carthaginian Empire? And normally, common land would be given to everyone, Everyone, right? Maybe in proportion, but it would be given to everyone, especially the poor who lost their land. But Rome made the decision that the rich would be compensated for letting money to be public during the war, meaning the rich got the lion's share of the new land. But not only that, the remaining common land, The rich just pretended it was theirs, okay? Meaning that they illegally occupied common land. They didn't pay for it, it wasn't theirs, but they just assumed it was theirs. And so now Rome had a problem. Rome was great, it was poor and small, it was threatened by its neighbors like the Etruscans, the Carthaginians, and the Greeks. But by 146 BCE, Rome had vanquished all its wealth major enemies and basically it was an empire and by 146 Rome had become a contradiction. The contradiction is this. It is an imperial republic. It is an empire now but its form of government is a republic and this was a contradiction and suddenly these three values, piety, liberty and and republica, these values that made Rome strong were now problems for the Roman people. So let me explain how. Let's look at republica. Republica means public virtue in Latin. It's the idea that the best and brightest in Rome are in competition with each other to promote the Roman national welfare, welfare, okay, to bring glory to Rome. That's, if you were the best and the brightest, then your responsibility to your family and to the gods and to the nation was to win new territory for Rome, okay? And so the first thing you had to do was basically win political office. And when Rome was poor, it was basically a meritocracy, right? you had to prove like you were the best speaker or you had the best resume in order to be promoted. But now that you have money, what you realize you could do is just bribe people, okay? And then so very soon bribe we just became a fact of politics in Rome. Once you went to the office, you can then become a general to go off to provinces to fight wars, to win new territory for Rome. home, okay? But because you got into so much debt to win the blow off is when you went to the province, you did two things. First of all, you exploited the local people, okay? Because you need to get back that money that you spent. And the second thing that you did was you start wars for no reason. You antagonize the locals in order to start wars. If you start wars, you win a lot of money, right? You can enslave the people and make money in that way, but also you will receive something called a triumph. Okay? Triumph. Now triumph is just a military parade that establishes you as a hero of Rome. And not only do you benefit politically, but your entire family benefits. Okay? So your sons, your grandsons, your great-grandsons will all be remembered and celebrated because of your triumph. and they are much more likely to win political office in their careers. So the triumph is a very, very big thing. The problem is while the best and brightest won competition with each other, the poor were suffering. So the first problem is land. Remember, during the Hannibal Wars, the Second Punic War, the poor lost a lot of land and they were never compensated for it. But then what happened is, as Rome continued to fight these wars, the poor was being drafted into the army and they were going to like Spain and Syria. These are far away places and they were stuck there for like years. That meant their land couldn't be cultivated and therefore they got into debt and they couldn't pay other debt So what happened was the rich would come in and buy off the land at very cheap prices. And so the rich became major landowners. And this is a problem because first of all, the poor didn't have any land in order to grow food. So they were forced into the cities. Their problem is the rich didn't want to grow food to feed the people. They want to grow food as cash crops for export. So suddenly for the first time in its history, Rome couldn't feed itself. You have to rely on imports from the provinces. Okay, so the land was a huge issue. But then you also had issues like debt, right? So the poor couldn't pay off their debts their debts and they became overwhelmed by the by interest and So this created lots of problems for Rome. Okay, so you had a lot of violence You have a lot of corruption. You have a lot of inequality Okay, and so this started a cycle That Peter church and cause elite overproduction Right, so in terms of peace and as your population grows You're gonna have too many elite who are now in competition with each other. And it's usually between the upper nobility and the lower nobility. Okay? So upper nobility are people who are established. They're the wealthiest citizens in all of Rome. They're very happy with the system as it is. The lower nobility are people who are born into wealth, but they want more. They want prestige, they want honor, they want the triumph. And so they're struggling against the operability for political power. And usually you do that by aligning yourself with the people, right? And the people who are now numbering the millions are pissed off because they have no land, they're too much in debt and no jobs, okay? And so these two factions in Rome would be called, the operability would be called the optimates. Okay, optimates just means best people, we're the best. And our responsibility is to uphold to tradition of Rome, which is piety, liberty, and republic of. OK? And these people with low nobility want to change their call populars. And that's where we get the term populist vote. So in 146 BCE, after Rome had become an empire and had defeated all its enemies, these two factions start to emerge. And they clash with each other. So historians normally believe the first clash happened with the Gratchy brothers, okay? The Gratkis brothers. And these are, again, Lordability who had a very simple idea, land reform, okay? The idea is very simple. You have rich people who have too much land and not used the land properly. They're using the land as parks for themselves, I'd like to use private parks for themselves, or they're going crash crops, which does not feed well. Most of this land, which is again common land, the rich are occupying it illegally, is not being used productively. So what they proposed was a simple land reform law. And the idea is this, the government of Rome would buy out the rich from the land they are illegally occupying. Does that make sense? The rich won't be kicked out the land, they're illegally occupying, they'll be compensated for it. So this makes perfect sense, not a problem, right? And once Rome buys out this land, it will then redistribute it to the poor so the poor will have a social safety system. They're able to feed themselves. And they'll usually grow grain and other crops for sustenance and this will enable the feeding of the Roman population in general, okay? So this sounds very simple to us. The rich didn't like this idea because they didn't like change in general, okay? they like the idea of piety, liberty, and republic, which means things must stay the way they are. And what's really important is the rich cannot be challenged by the poor because if that were the case, then the social system would be overhauled, okay? So the rich were so pissed off that they assassinated both brothers, the crackage brothers. And most historians believe this is the beginning of the fall of the Roman Republic because it tells us that the system is incapable of change. The system as it sets up, which focus on piety, liberty and republic car, it's a contradiction now. And this contradiction cannot be internally resolved. So any more questions? Any questions before I proceed on? I know this is a lot and maybe I'm an organizer properly, but are there any confusions about this history so far. Again, I'm just providing some background and context before I move on to Julius Caesar. Yeah? Okay, yeah, this is a great question. What's the relationship between optimists and the populars? Okay, there's exactly like 20 noble families in Rome, okay? And so these people, the optimists and the populars all come from these 20 noble families. And they're like cousins of each other. Okay, so the optimists are maybe like the fathers and the grandfathers and the populars or the sons. Does that make sense? Because the fathers don't want any change, but the sons want political power. And so they're all related. They all group with each other. They all know each other. Does that make sense? OK. All right. Echol, are you good? Is this clear to you so far? All right. All right. So the first major conflict is the Gracchi brothers. Second major conflict that happens or something called a social war. And the social war is basically this. The people who fight the wars are the allies, the Italian allies of Rome, okay? People who live in the neighboring provinces. They're the ones who fight the war. And after Rome keeps on winning these wars, Rome refuses to grant citizenship to them, okay? So these neighbors rebel and there's a civil war going on in Rome and Rome loses this war. And Rome is forced to grant citizenship to these neighbors. But the question then is, what is the nature of citizenship? Like how much rights do you get? How much power do you get? Because Rome is republic and so one thing that's hard for us to understand is not all voters or equal. So if you're a rich voter, you have more power than if you are a poor voter. So the question then is, these new citizens of Rome, what sort of voting rights will they have? And this is an issue that became a huge issue over the next few decades, so the social war. Then you have these slavery votes, what they call the servile wars. Okay? Then you have these piracy going on. So the Republic is constantly in turmoil and in conflict. And the war between the optimists and the populars becomes so intense that ultimately they fight a civil war. A civil war means two armies killing each other. And so the civil war was between Sola and Marius. And the civil war becomes so intense that both Sola and Marius do the unthinkable and they march their armies into Rome and kill their enemies. This has never been done in Roman history before. As a general, you're not supposed to take your soldier and march against your own government, against your own city and kill your own people, okay? But that's what they both do. Sola wins the Civil War and he understands like all Romans that this can't go on, okay? There has to be a solution. And Sola's solution is, well, you know, if the problem is a conflict between the populars and the aftermath, let's just kill all the populars and then the problem we saw, then you have stability in Rome. Okay, and this is what we refer to as prescription, prescription. And prescription means this. There's a list, a public list of about a thousand, two thousand, okay, individuals. And these individuals are basically sanctioned to be killed. So if you go kill them, you'll be rewarded by the state and you'll be given a property of those you killed. Okay? And it's called prescription. And this is a new invention by Soloi in order to resolve the conflict between the optimists and the populars. One of those individuals who was designated to be prescribed his name is Julius Caesar. He's about 19 years old now, okay? Julius Caesar comes from a very prestigious woman family called the Julie Eye and he's the nephew of Marius and that's why he was was prescribed. Now the good thing is, if you're rich, you can bribe your way out of these things. And Julius Caesar's family was extremely wealthy. And he was able to bribe Stola into letting him go. So Julius Caesar's life was spared. And Stola believed that by doing this, by killing off the populaires, by making the optimists, the supreme power in the land, this conflict would go away. But after Sola died, this didn't happen. In fact, the conflict became even worse. So Julius Caesar grew up in this conflict. He grew up in a time of the imperial republic, a contradiction. And he saw himself as a man of destiny to save the republic by implementing reforms necessary in order to restore stability in Rome. Okay, he basically wanted to make Rome great again. Any questions so far? Is this all clear to you guys? Okay, all right, so let's talk about the life of Julius Caesar, okay? From an early age, Julius Caesar saw himself as special. But not only that, but from an early age, Julius Caesar cared a lot about his public image. He cared about how people perceived and remember him. So here's a story to highlight the myth-making genius of Julius Caesar. So when Julius Caesar was 25, he was sent off to Anatolia to work as an official there. Now the problem with sailing at this time is there's a lot of piracy, because there's a lot of corruption, inequality, and poverty in the empire. And so in 25, Julius Caesar was kidnapped, captured and kidnapped by pirates. Not a big deal because he's of the nobility. And it's obvious he's of the nobility. And so the pirates asked for a ransom, he's gonna pay the ransom, and Julius Caesar was free to go. Now, very simple story. But what Julius Caesar did was he embellished the story. He made certain adjustments to the story that made it memorable to people so that people would discuss it everywhere. The first embellishment he made was this. The pirates asked for a 20 silver talent ransom, which is a lot of money. And Julius Caesar said, when I heard this, I felt insulted. How dare you ask for 20 silver talents? I'm worth at least 50. Okay? So, hey guys, don't ask for 20, ask for 50. My family can afford it. Okay, so that's the first embellishment. The second embellishment he made was, Julie Caesar said, I'd be in front of the pirates, we drank together, he's a very charismatic individual. And I told them while we were drinking, hey guys, after I go home, I'm gonna come back and like capture all of you and crucify every one of you. And the pirates are like, that's really funny man, okay? So that's the second embellishment. The third embellishment is Julius Caesar, after he was released, he set up a navy and he went and found every one of these pirates and crucified every one of them. And that's the third embellishment because we actually don't know if he actually did this. But again, the thing that Julius Caesar understands is it doesn't matter if the facts are true or not. What matters is how appealing are the details, right? So this story you will remember forever and you will tell others about it. So through this, he's creating a myth of himself. Does that make sense? And again, there's no way any of these things are true, right? He's like, oh, 20 talents, I'm insulted. Ask for 50 guys, okay? And while he's drinking with these guys, and these are pirates, these are like psychopaths, right? He's like, I'm gonna come back and kill every one of you. Everyone of you. But again, that's a myth-making genius of Julius Caesar. So, again, as a young man, the greatest honor in Rome is to achieve the triumph. And you do that by starting wars. So, through bribery and through charisma, Caesar selected a praetor. And then as a praetor, he goes off to Spain. He fights these wars against the tribes of Spain. And then he wins a triumph, okay? And what he wants to do is he wants to basically use a triumph as the screen board for his political career to win the council ship. At this point, okay, the optimists hate Julius Caesar. Because Julius Caesar, again, he's myth-making genius. He's selling all these stories and it's pissing off the optimists Because I see Julius Caesar as, you know, as, he's just a braggit, okay? He's arrogant, he just brags all the time. He's appeasing the people. He's exactly what women should not be, okay? He's impious, he doesn't care for liberty, he doesn't care about the public good. All he cares about is his own personal glory. But he's got a reputation for this. He's also got a reputation for being a libertine, okay? Meaning like he sleeps with man and woman everywhere, okay? And the Roman optimists, okay? People who include Cato, Scipio, and Cicero, okay? These are the three most famous. They hate Julius Caesar with a passion. They think Caesar represents all that wrong with Rome. He's a young man who has talent and charisma, And he's a genius of some sort, but he's using it not for the glory of Rome, but for his own personal political advancement. Caesar represents to them the corruption of the Roman Republic, okay? And they develop, you can use this phrase, Caesar derangement syndrome. They have decided that they will do whatever they can to destroy this guy. So Caesar wins a triumph, and he wants the win, and he wants to get the council ship, okay? The problem is, you can only be a general to get the triumph, but you have to give up your general ship in order to stand for election for the council, okay? So the author needs to give him a choice. You can either have the triumph or you can have the council ship, it's your choice. And they think this guy is so arrogant, he will never give up the triumph, okay? And Caesar surprises everyone by giving up the triumph. He's like, I don't want this crap. I want to stand for election. So that's the other thing that's really surprising about Caesar. He's unpredictable. Or you can also argue he understands the mentality or the motivations of his opponents, but his opponents never understand him. They always underestimate him. So Caesar is council, and as council, he wants to do what everyone wants to do and promote stability in Rome. So he's promoting land reform. And here, the optimists try to obstruct him wherever they can. The other thing is, after the council ship, Caesar wants to go take over Gaul. And Gaul is the northern province in Rome. And there, he wants to win glory for himself. That's a plan. The authors understand this, and so beforehand, they decide the next council will be sent to Italy, which is basically Rome. If you're in Rome, you can't fight wars. You can't fight wars, you can't win glory, you cannot triumph, and that's the idea. We'll let Caesar be council, but we'll have him in Italy building roads and cutting trees. We're not going to go fight wars in Gaul, that's for sure. Caesar knows about this, and he does something that's really unexpected. He forms an alliance with two other individuals that the Senate hates, okay? The first is Pompey, and Pompey is considered the greatest general of Rome. Okay, he's called Pompey the Great. And he's also pissed off the Senate because Pompey the Great wins all these wars for Rome and he has to settle his veterans, right? that he has to give land to his veterans, but the Senate refuses, okay? So Pompey's pissed off at the Senate as well. And then there's Crassus. And Crassus is the richest man in Rome. He's the wealthiest man in Rome. And he's pissed off at the Senate as well because the Senate is blocking a lot of his political career. So they form a secret alliance called the First Triumvirate. And so they do a lot of these deals. So Caesar as council will help settle the veterans of Pompeii. They'll promote some tax reform that Crassus wants. And in return, Pompeii and Crassus will give him Gull as the promise that he will take over once he leaves his council ship, okay? So that's the plan. When Caesar becomes council leader of Gull, the provincial governor of Gull, the pro council from 58 to 51 BCE, at this point Caesar becomes a legend in Rome. This is where his myth-making genius really shines. He goes and commits genocide in Gaul basically. In the words of Caesar, I went to Gaul, I killed a million Gauls in war, I enslaved a million Gauls, and then I let a million Gauls live. So he basically committed genocide against the Gauls. It was all for his personal glory. And he was starting all these wars in Gaul in order to accomplish three things. The first thing he wanted to do was money. He got into a lot of debt because he had to bribe a lot of people in order to secure his council ship. He had to pay them off. So he made a lot of money. The money that he had left over, he sent back to Rome to organize feasts and festivals for the Roman people. The term we use today is called bread and circus. Bread and circus, okay? So that's what Caesar was doing in order to ingrate himself with the Roman people. Okay, so that's the first major purpose of these wars. Second major purpose of these wars is to create the world's greatest army. Remember, Rome is mainly at peace at this time and if they're fighting wars, they're fighting wars against a lesser opponent. Okay? The Gauls are tough warriors. And the Roman, his Roman soldier are getting the best training in the world For eight years of constant fighting the Gauls, okay So who this process he created the most loyal and most disciplined army in the world and they're all They're all loyal to him personally Okay, because he's the one rewarding them and he's the one who brings victory to them All right the second thing the third thing which is the most important is is he creates the myth of Caesar as the great conqueror. Romans loved generals, Romans loved conquerors. And while Caesar was in Gaul fighting these wars, what he would do is he would write down dispatches or maybe reports, right? Then he would send his soldier back to Rome and in the form of Rome, okay, the main place, public place, He would set up and he would read the accomplishment of Caesar of that week. And the things he was doing was, I mean, it basically captured the imagination of Rome, of all Romans, okay? So for example, he attacked Germania. Germania and Romans fought the Germans or so barbaric, it was impossible to attack them. The second thing that Caesar did to capture the imagination of Romans is he invaded Britain. Britain in the imagination of Romans was this mystical imaginary place and no one knew what it was. And Caesar launched two major expeditions against Britain. That didn't really do anything, but that was on a point. The point was Caesar ventured into the unknown. It's basically equivalent back then of the moon landing. Does that make sense? because it was just unheard of. Like why would you go to Britain? Aren't there like dragons in Britain? Aren't there like sea monsters in Britain? And Caesar went there twice, okay? So at this point, the Romans worship Caesar, okay? Caesar's bribing them with like bread and circus and he's winning all these military exploits in Gaul and he's constructing a new reality of Caesar as the great honker, okay? So, does it make sense so far? He's a myth maker. So, while Caesar is doing this, the optimists in Rome, back in Rome, Cato, Scipio, and Cicero, they now see what a threat Caesar is. They realize this guy's not beatable. If he runs for elections, he's gonna win all the elections. His allies are gonna win the elections. So, they decide to strip him of his command, of his military command and put him on trial for all the things he did illegally. And Caesar, he's not a nice person. He's done a lot of illegal, immoral things in order to accomplish power. So the Senate has a major case against him. And at this point, Caesar recognizes that, listen, these guys mean war. So what Caesar does is, He basically declared war on Rome. He crossed the Rubricot. And the Senate is a pope by this, and they appoint Pompey, who again, is considered the greatest general in Rome at this point, to counter Caesar. And this starts the second Civil War, the first Civil War between Solid Marius. Okay, so now it's Caesar versus Pompey. Any questions so far about this? Sure, that's a great question, okay? So the Senate is about, it's about 300 foreign people, it's a lot of people, okay? But the power in the Senate is not distributed equally. So if you are, so think of the Senate as maybe many circles, okay? If you are the main, if you have the most power, you sit at the front. Why is that important? Because you're able to speak if you sit at the front. Doesn't make sense. So even though technically voting, everyone has the same voting rights, the people at the front are those who are able to set the agenda and control the debate and make speeches. Everyone back here are not allowed to say anything, okay? Because you go in turns. The people who sit at the front are the optimists because they come to the most prestigious families and they have the most illustrious political careers. Okay, does that make sense? All right. So when Caesar invades Rome, basically declared war on the Roman Senate. Okay? So let's look at a map of Rome at this time. This is the year 49 BCE. All right, so Rome is an empire. You have Italy here. This is Rome. Over here is basically Northern Africa. Over here is Spain. Over here is Greece. Then over here is Anatolia, Syria. Okay, so that's the Roman Empire. Okay? At this point when Caesar crossed the river card, he controls basically Gaul, which is poor, which is poor, okay? He controls Rome. The optimists in Pompeii, they control Spain, Greece, Anatolia, Syria, and Northern Africa. That's a problem for Caesar because remember, Rome gets its food from the provinces, okay? So in other words, all Pompeii has to do is wait. This is what we call a containment strategy. Containment strategy. Look, Caesar can't do anything, right? And eventually, because Romans are starving because of this blockade, then the Romans will rise against Caesar, game over. That's all the authors have to do, just wait it out. Over time, Caesar will lose the loyalty of his troops and all the Roman people, and then he will be weak, and then at that point they can attack him. The war will be over, because that makes sense. So the odds are against Caesar because he's basically one man versus an entire empire. But Cicero has two advantages. He has two major advantages. The first advantage he has is he has, again, the world's greatest military, who have fought eight years in Spain. They're extremely disciplined. They're extremely devoted to him. That's the first major advantage. The second major advantage is the division within the ultimate opposition. Because even though the optimists, Cato and Cicero and Scipio, they hate Caesar, they don't trust Pompey either. Because as this war continues, more and more power will accrue to Pompey. He's gonna have more and more power. So even though Pompey wants to drag this war out, the optimists don't want this war to drag out. They're afraid that if Caesar as dictator, they will make Pompey the dictator. Because the optimists, what they're gonna do is maintain the status quo. They don't want a new king to arise. They don't want a situation where Caesar loses, but Pompey wins. Does that make sense? So all the optimists are pushing Pompey to end the war as quickly as possible. And this division will be costly. In fact, it will basically cause Pompey's life. So, given these two advantages, the divisions within the ultimate opposition and given that Caesar has the world's greatest army, Caesar decides he must take the offensive. Okay? So, first thing he does is he takes his army to Spain and crushes all opposition in Spain. When he crushes opposition in Spain, he does something that's not very Roman, okay? He offers clemency to the enemy. Basically he tells his enemies, okay? We're all Romans, we're all fighting for the greater good of Rome. So I've won this war, will you promise not to fight against me? If you promise you won't fight against me anymore, I'll let you go, okay? And when he did that, some chose to just go home. But there are also many who like, who chose to go and fight for Pompey in Greece, okay? All right? But that's what Julius Caesar is doing. He's winning these wars against his opponents and he's letting them go. He's forgiving them. So that's the first thing that Caesar does, and then he marches to Greece. And again, at this point, Pompey doesn't have to do anything. And Pompey doesn't want to do anything because he knows that Caesar has a superior army, okay? These are two of the greatest generals Rome has ever produced, Caesar and Pompey. They understand each other, they understand warfare. And Pompey just wants to use the containment strategy and starve Caesar out. Caesar wants to fight a battle right away. And what tips of balance is the optimists who force, sorry, the optimists, Cato, Sibyl and Cicero, who force Pompey to fight a battle. And in August 48 BCE, at a place called Pharsalus, the two armies meet, Pompey and Caesar. Pompey chooses to use the Anvil and Hammer strategy. Remember what the Anvil and Hammer strategy is? Where your infantry locks the enemy army into place. It locks in place and then from behind, the cavalry comes in and wipes out the enemy infantry. That's the strategy. This is what Axon and the Great, this is the strategy that Philip and Axon and the Great used against the Greeks and Persia. The problem is the, Julius Caesar's army is so disciplined and so experienced that they have stood the cavalry charge and they wiped out the army at Pharsalus. Then Caesar took his army to Egypt, conquer that, to Syria conquer that, and to Anatolian conquer that. The Senate asked for a report from Caesar, like how so we're going, what's happening. And Caesar said the most famous line that they ever said. And again, he's myth-making genius, right? He basically said, vini, vedi, vici. Beautiful Latin, the most powerful Latin phrase ever spoken in human history. It means, I came, I saw, I conquered. And again, this captured the imagination of the Roman people. After Caesar calmed the Roman east, he goes to Africa to fight Cato and Scipio at the Battle of Phatsis. And again, Caesar wants to show clemency. He wants to show how generous and merciful he is. But at this point, his soldiers who are getting very old, they just want this water end and they want to go home. So at this battle, what they do is they defy orders, direct orders of Caesar not to engage. They took it upon themselves to attack the enemy and at this point, they're winning the war, right? They're winning the battle. Caesar orders them to show mercy. The veterans, his veterans, massacre their enemies to ensure they can't fight back again. The last battle is in Spain at the mouth of Manda. And here, the enemy is on a hill. And you're not supposed to fight uphill. You're not supposed to go up a hill and fight the enemy there because you're at a major disadvantage. Caesar's soldiers now are so experienced and disciplined that they can do that. He can march up the hill and destroy the enemy. Okay? So that's how powerful Caesar's army is at this point. They basically wipe out every army they fight against. Like we conquer the Roman Empire. Okay, does that make sense? Caesar goes back to Rome in 44. And this is the year he'll be assassinated by his friends. He launches legislative reform to reform the Roman Republic. He launches land reform. He launches debt relief. He creates something called the Julian calendar. The Julian calendar is what we still use today. Before Julius Caesar, the Romans used the lunar calendar. And then Julius Caesar working with astronomers, they designed together the Julian calendar, which is exactly what we still use today. That's a major reform. He offered clemency to all his enemies. Basically, if you're willing to work for the good of Rome, he will invite you back into the Senate. He offered citizenship to his soldiers and to Italians. He brought in citizenship in Rome. So what Caesar was doing was he was basically trying resolve a lot of the contradictions that led to instability and civil war and revolution in Rome before them, okay? And he was successful. And he was considered a genius. And he was loved by the people. In fact, he was everywhere. He had bust of himself everywhere, okay? And he made coins, money, that had his face on it. So he was basically creating what we call a cult of personality. And he wanted to continue to expand the Roman Empire. His plan was to go fight a place called Parthia, which is the old Persian Empire. And then he wanted to go conquer Germany. He basically wanted to conquer the entire world. That was his ambition. His ambition was to make Rome great again. And he almost succeeded, except ultimately he is killed by his friends. There's an assassin in 44 BC. So let's look at those three questions again. First of all, what motivates Caesar? Second question is, why do they succeed? The third question is, why do they kill him? So I think what motivated him is exactly what motivated someone like Sola and Marius and other great generals of Rome. They want to make Rome great again. They're nostalgic for the Rome of the Hannibal Wars, right? When everyone came together and made a sacrifice necessary in order to protect and save Rome. You want to return that era, okay? And that's what motivated him. He didn't want to become king. And if he became king, he didn't want to stay as king. Remember, Sola won the war and he could have made himself king, but he didn't do that. He implemented a lot of reforms and then retired because that was the Roman way. That's what the ancestors did. And he wanted to be loyal to the gods, to the ancestors, and to Rome. So Caesar didn't want to become king. He just wanted to save Rome. Second question then is, how is he able to succeed? And this is a more difficult question. So again, the argument is he's a myth maker. What does that mean? Okay, so there are different individuals in society that promote the social good, okay? Or they're able to accomplish great things in different aspects of society. The first is the general, right? The general. The general, he is bold and disciplined. And he's fair, right? That's why the soldiers follow him. He's bold, he's disciplined, and he's fair. He's also concerned about organization and logistics. How do you move an army from place to place? How do you feed your army? Okay, that's what the general does. That's what the great general does. That's what Hannibal did, okay? Then you have the politician. And the politician, he's basically like an avatar of the people. He's able to capture and represent the emotions and the dreams, the longings of the people. He's very charismatic and he's very manipulative. He's able to tell stories that capture the emotional imagination of the people. That's what the politician does. Then you have the administrator or the legislator. And this person is very concerned about details and law and legal aspects, regulation. And the person, you can say, is almost a systems design thinker. Very big picture, very macro, trying to figure out how different pieces fit together. If you think about it, these three individuals, the general, the politician, and the administrator, the legislator, they're very different personalities. They're in contradictions with each other. So for example, Pompey was a great general, was a terrible, terrible politician. Hannibal was a great general too, but he was not a good legislator. The thing that made Julius Caesar distinctive is he was all three together. Because what enables you to be all three together is the imagination. That was Julius Caesar's secret power, his imagination. He was able to imagine himself as different people at once. And therefore, he was different people at once. He had multiple personalities. And that's why he was so unpredictable. That's why he was able to understand the motivations of his opponents. And that's why he was able to accomplish so much. Okay? Doesn't make sense. Okay? And so he became a myth maker. The problem with being a myth maker is you ultimately have to change reality. And by treating reality, you make people who are accustomed to reality uncomfortable. And so that's why he was killed. He was killed by not his enemies, but by his friends. So there were four major conspirators against Julius Caesar. They were decimists, Buddhists, who was basically Caesar's lieutenant in war. You had Trebonius, again, the major lieutenant of Caesar. But you also had Cassius. Cassius was actually fighting for Pompey. But Caesar thought he was such a great general that Caesar pardoned him. And you also had Marcus Buddhist, who Caesar actually saw as a son. So these are the people who are closest to Caesar, and they ultimately killed Caesar. because even though Caesar was making Rome better, he was changing Rome, which caused them to feel uncomfortable and anxious about the future of Rome. Okay, does that make sense? So an analogy is this. Let's just say that one day the Chinese government says, we're gonna outlaw rice, right, right, white rice, because white rice has proven to be scientifically bad for you, okay? It's not nutritious for you. Instead, we're gonna make every Chinese eat steak and potatoes and broccoli so that Chinese can be strong and healthy. Okay? How do Chinese feel about this? They'd be pissed, okay? Do you understand? So, you know, it's unfortunate that seizure did nothing wrong. And what everything that seizure did was for the good of Rome, but change, reform, causes, carnive dissonance. Okay? people anxious and comfortable, it disrupts your identity. That's why there's conspiracy that ultimately killed Caesar. Does that make sense? The question, how did Caesar challenge the identity of being Roman? That's your question. Let's look at his reforms. First of all, he had the Julian calendar. calendar. So he was challenging people's sense of time, time. You understand? So before you had the lunar calendar, now you have the Julian calendar. Second thing that he did was he was doing all the stuff by himself. Okay, he was winning these military victories by himself. He was introducing much reform legislation by himself. He was a great man. But if You're Roman, what you have been taught is these three ideas, piety, piety, liberty and republic car, which is to say no one is above Rome. Everyone is equal in the eyes of Rome. This general who won against Hannibal or Carthage or the Greeks, it wasn't because he was a great man, which because he was fighting for Rome. Okay? So the fact that Julius Caesar was a genius, that he was so brilliant and he was able to accomplish so much, it made them jealous, right? It made people jealous. But at the same time, it made them see him as a threat to the very stability of Rome. Does that make sense? Because people like Julius Caesar aren't supposed to exist. Rome does not need kings. In fact, Rome is anti-Marnarchy. So they were very much afraid that Julius Caesar thought of himself as a god, and he would make himself king. And in fact, Julius Caesar, I mean, had hubris, right? Obviously if you believe that you by yourself can change Rome, you have hubris. But he was not showing enough deference to the Senate. He was creating a code of personality. He was being very arrogant. It seemed very much like he wanted to become king. Does that make sense? So there's a lot of evidence. This is just that Caesar wanted to become king. And that's what made them uncomfortable. What I'm saying is the real issue is the idea of carniviscence, where the very existence of Caesar challenged the perception of what Rome was and what Rome met. Does that make sense? But very good question, okay? Any more questions? Crashes. Oh, okay. So, Pompey and Crashes and Caesar, how did they form their alliance, right? Okay, so first thing to understand is, Pompey and Crashes were both optimists. They were supporters of Sola. Remember, Sola is the one who crushed the populars. So Pompey and Crassus were conservatives. They were optimists. Caesar was a popular. So their alliance was secret and was completely unexpected. And that's why they were able to accomplish so much. Because politically, they were all to each other. The reason why they formed an alliance is this basically expedience. Pompey had issues that he wanted to pass through the Senate. Crasses had issues that he wanted to pass through the Senate and Caesar as well So they decided it would be political expedient to work together That's a genius of Caesar. Okay, he's very charismatic. He's very manipulative. So he's he was able to Form a alliance with people who were technically his enemies Okay, pumpkin crashes were his enemies there. They were politically at odds with him, but Caesar was able to put aside political differences and form an alliance for the sake of interest and expediency. Does that make sense? But obviously this would not last very long. Anymore questions? Okay. Okay, so next class we're gonna look at the world that Caesar created. Because after he dies the Republic falls. So we will look at what happens after he dies and look at the birth of the Roman Empire."}

So we are doing Augustine today. And even though Augustine is not as famous as some other thinkers we've looked at this semester, he's actually very important. Because he's actually the intellectual architect of the Catholic Church. And in this world, the Catholic Church is the largest organization. It has 1.5 billion members. It's been around for almost 2,000 years. So Augustine really is the individual who conceptualized the idea of the Catholic Church. So first I understand what the Catholic Church is and why it's endured for so long. I want to introduce a new idea to you called the end of history. This is a concept that was introduced by an American State Department official named Francis Fukuyama at the end of the Cold War when the Berlin Wall fell. And his argument is that history has been a struggle of ideology. We've had paganism. We've had communism. We've had socialism. We've had democracy. And through this dialectic, through this constant struggle of ideas, we have now reached the end of history where liberal consumer democracy is the best idea. Not only is it the best idea, but it's the perfect idea that will allow us to endure for the rest of history. Therefore, it is the end of history. Now of course, we know this idea is wrong. What's interesting for us is this has been a recurring theme in human history, where every major political leader who's come to power has announced that this is the end of history, that all history has led to this point where I am now ruler. And from now on, we can enjoy paradise on Earth. So let's look at some examples that we looked at this semester. First example is King David, right? Remember that we discussed that when King David came in the power, he sponsored the running of the Bible as an apology to explain why he's king. And we also looked at the story constructed by the Yahwehs, how Yahweh, the God, he builds the world because he's a poet, because he's lonely. And history is a journey of Yahweh trying to find a good friend that could accompany him for eternity. And it turns out, eventually, he finds David. And so when he finds David, he annoys the house of David as the permanent rulers of our world. So that's the Bible. But then you have Augustus, who sponsored the writing of the Iniad. And remember the Indian, it's really the journey of the Trojan hero, Enius, as he leaves Troy and he is destined by the gods to found the city of Rome and the Roman Empire. And why does he do this? Because eventually Rome will become the greatest empire on earth, with Augustus as the first emperor. And so that's the end of history. Once the Roman Empire is constructed, then peace, Eternal peace is now on earth. And then you had Hosentin, who was emperor after he fought a brutal civil war to reunite the Roman Empire. And once he rebuilt the Roman Empire, he converted to Kushiani and he organized in 325 the Council of Nessia where they agreed to introduce the idea of the Godhead. Remember we discussed last class, how the idea of the Godhead marks a major intellectual revolution in human history. It's the beginning of monotheism. It's the idea that God is both everything and nothing, which is also the idea of empire. There's also a major civil war after Cossin dies. Another Roman emperor, Dossassus, comes with throne. And in 380, the issue is something called the edict of Fessa Lonica, which established Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. And when he does that, they begin to root out paganism and other religions. And at this point, you can also think this is the end of history. We've discovered Christianity, which will make paradise on earth. The problem, though, of course, is that in 410, Rome is sacked. And this is a problem. This creates something called a crisis of faith. Why? Because a lot of people believe that Rome was sacked by the barbarians, by the Vistagoths, precisely because Rome converted to Christianity. before Rome was a pagan society. And they believed that by converting to Christianity, two things happened. The first thing that happened was the old gods, Jupiter and the others, became furious at the Romans and were determined to punish the Romans by sending the barbarians, okay? Also they believed that Christianity, it's a religion of slaves. It teaches us to be merciful and kind and compassionate. But that's not the way the world works. So now you have a crisis of faith. And the very authority of the Catholic Church is challenged. And so at this point, Augustine, who is a bishop of the Catholic Church in northern Africa, he comes up with this theory that establishes the Catholic Church as beyond the world. So other individuals have introduced the idea of end of history. But what Augustine does is he takes the Catholic Church out of history, okay? Out of history. What does that mean? It means that history is really about mortals battling for power. But the Catholic Church, it is the representative of God on earth. Therefore, it will remove itself from history. You guys can battle it out. But we will always be the representative of God on earth. And to establish this, He writes a book called City of God. And he talks about two cities. You have Rome, which is the earthly city. It's a city of power and greed and the self. And then you have a city called Jerusalem, which is the spiritual city. It is the city of God, of spirit, of selflessness, of paradise. And the Catholic Church will always be centered in Jerusalem. And if you follow the Catholic Church, if you are obedient to God, then your spirit can also enter Jerusalem. Otherwise, you'll always be trapped in Rome. What he also does, that's very important, is by establishing this theory, he solves a major problem for political leaders. Remember before David, Augustine, and Constantine, whenever they came into power, they faced three major problems. The first is legitimacy. Why you the king? The second is cultural cohesion. How do you let the people behind a common ideology? The third problem was cultural differentiation. Why you different from other people? Okay, and what the Catholic Church under Augustine proposes is, We'll solve all three problems for you. We, the Catholic Church, will give you legitimacy because you are the representative of God on earth. Okay? And that's why even though in the following few centuries, there'll always be power shifts, the Catholic Church will always be at the center of these power shifts because they are the ones who are able to provide authority and legitimacy ever comes into power like for example shulamane so that's what uh... augustine is proposing so today what i would look at uh... are some of augustines writings to see what is the ideology or doctrine that underlies the catholic church this is important for us because it is augustines ideology that would drive european history for the next thousand years In fact, I will make the argument to you today that it is his ideology that will mark the coming of the dark ages in Europe. 500 years when society lacked social innovation and you weren't allowed to criticize authority. Okay, so that's the argument to you today. I'll sit over here and talk. Oh, thank you, okay. All right, yeah, sorry. Yeah, this is why I don't use computers. Okay, yeah, it's fine. All right, so we are gonna look at two major works of Augustine, the first is Confessions. And Confessions is very famous, it's something that most people would've heard of. And it's really the autobiography of Augustine. And in fact, it's considered the first authentic autobiography in the world. And in the story, he talks about his life, where he grows up with a pagan father and a Christian mother, Monica. And in the beginning, he's a very disobedient young man. He refuses to follow the wishes of his mother and refuses Christianity. And he goes on a long journey of youthful sin. He has a mistress who he doesn't marry. He explores heresies like Neoplatonism and Medicism, but then one day he has a what we call a Damascus moment. God speaks to him and says, Augustine, open the Bible. He opens the Bible and this starts his religious journey. And in age 42, Augustine becomes the Bishop of Hippo. And from then he begins to construct the ideology that will underpin the Catholic Church. OK? Now, for whatever reason, historians think this memoir is authentic, or he's telling the truth. And the one thing that you will learn in life is whenever a politician or a powerful individual writes a memoir, it's complete BS. OK? There's something authentic or true about it. So we're going to read a bit of Confessions, and this is really the most famous part of the Confessions. It's really Augustine's rewriting of a story of the Garden of Eden. So this is what he says when he's a young man or a young boy. I wanted to carry out an act of theft and did so, driven by no kind of need other than my inner lack of any sense of or feeling for justice. Okay? So one thing that he points out over and over again is we are born in sin. We are all sin. We are evil people. Okay? And that's why the Catholic Church is important. Because only the Catholic Church can steer us into goodness. If left to our own devices, we can only commit sin. And this starts from the womb. Okay? We are born in sin. We are born of sin. I saw something which I had in plan T of much better quality. My desire was not to enjoy not what I sought by stealing but merely excitement of thieving and the doing of what was wrong. Why do we sin? Because we enjoy sinning. Because that is our nature. When we steal it is not because we're hungry or because we need something. It's because we enjoy stealing. It's peer pleasure. There's a peer tree near our vineyard laden with fruit, though attractive in neither color nor taste. So again, this is the retelling of the Garden of Eden, where there's a tree of knowledge. Well, here, there's a peer tree. To shake the fruit off the tree and carry off the peers, I, in a gang of naughty adolescents, set off late at night after we had continued our game in the streets. We carried off a huge load of peers. So they stole a huge load of peers from someone. He doesn't tell us who, but it's someone. And then they didn't eat any of the peers. They just gave it to pigs. They just did this because they enjoyed sinning. Now, let me make a few comments. First of all, we would think this is boys having fun. They don't mean any harm by this. They're just playing. They're just being curious. They're just exploring, which is part of human nature, right? What all this thing is saying is that's exactly the problem. Curiosity can only lead to evil. Exploration can only lead to sin. That's why we commit sin, because we think curiosity is a good thing when in fact it's an evil thing that can only harm others, okay? And the other thing is this is clearly a retelling of the Garden of Eden story, right? Where Adam and Eve, they eat that fruit. And here, what Augustine is saying is, first of all, Adam and Eve are stealing. That is not stealing is not a word used in the Bible. But Augustine is saying they are stealing. That's the first thing. Second thing is, Augustine is saying that the stealing was intentional. They knew what they were doing was wrong, but they did it because it felt good. So this is a radical reconceptualization of the idea of original sin. Remember, Paul introduced the idea of original sin to us, where why did Jesus have to come to redeem us because we disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden. It was a mistake and Jesus had to pay ransom for that mistake, okay? That was Paul's argument. What Augustine is saying is something radically different. He's saying that first of all, we need to make a mistake. We are the mistake, all right? We are the ones born to sin. Therefore we will always disobey it. And then what else he, what else, but what else he's saying is this, and this is really important. This happens in about 350, right? This is about 300 years after Jesus sacrificed himself for us, and he's still sinning. So he is negating the sacrifice of Jesus. Just because Jesus sacrificed himself does not mean we've stopped sinning. In fact, we continue to sin, okay? So this is a radical, reconceptualization of the Christian faith. We are born sinners and we will always sin unless we are taught to obey God. That was our fundamental mission on earth, to obey God. Okay? Okay, so let's go to the seat of God now. And again, the seat of God becomes the the interstitial blueprint for the building of the Catholic Church. And one thing that he talks a lot about in the state of God is the idea of rape. And so what's happening throughout this time, and what's very common is if a woman were raped out of wedlock or if a woman were raped by her husband, what they will often do is kill themselves. Why? Because the Christian faith taught them that chastity was very important. And if you're the one empire, this is a problem for you, because you can't have women killing themselves because of rape. Rape happens all the time. If women kill themselves, eventually, you're going to have a population implosion. So actually, what Robinson will do is spend a lot of time explaining why rape is not a bad thing. So to do so, he talks about Lucretia. Lucretia. Remember who Lucretia is? Lucretia, we discuss Lucretia when we discuss the history of the Roman Republic. At first Rome was a monarchy, and the king, the king's son, he was a sinful person and he liked to rape other women. He liked to rape women. And Lucretia was famous in Rome for her chastity, for her virtue. So he thought it'd be fun to rape her. After she was raped, she called her husband and her husband's best friend named Lucius Junius Budes to gather. And she made them swear that they will avenge her dishonoring. And they did. And to make sure that they would follow out on this, she took out a knife, and she stabbed herself in the heart, killing herself. And this marks the beginning of the Roman Republic. So in the eyes of Romans, her death, her suicide, is what gave birth to the Roman Republic. So she's honored and considered a hero by the Roman people. And what Augustine will say is, no, she's not a hero because she killed herself not for the good of Rome, but for her own vanity, for her own pride, for the fact that she lost faith. She was embarrassed. She didn't have the glory of being considered the most chaste and virtuous woman in Rome, and that's why she killed herself. And this is pride. This is arrogance. This is ego, which goes against the will of God. So let's look at very quickly what he's saying. Her killing herself or suicide because although not adulterous, she had suffered and adulterous embraces was due to the weakness of shame. The weakness of shame. She died because she felt ashamed. Not to the high value she set on chastity. She was ashamed of another's foul deed committed on her even though not with her as a Roman woman excessively eager for honor. Pride. That's what killed her, her pride. I hate computers. But Christian women do not kill themselves. If you are a true Christian, you would never kill yourself. Why? Because murder is a worse crime than rape. Also rape is something that happens in the mind. It's not real. Christian women do not kill themselves. They have the glory of Chesley within them, the testimony of their conscience. They have this in the sight of God. If you were raped but you didn't consent to it, don't worry because God knows and so God will forgive. But if you kill yourself, that's committing wrong against God. So this argument, I mean it's really gaslighting. And he does this a lot in his logic. He is really gasolineing. He's making certain points about the nature of humans. First of all, each and every one of us is God's property. We are not free of ourselves. We are God's property. Therefore, when we cure ourselves, we are offending God. That's the first thing. Second thing that he's saying is, we can do no good because we are burdened by by our pride and our sin. If we choose to act, we can only do wrong, okay? So what he's saying is this, if you are walking in the forest and you see a young boy drowning in the lake, don't jump in the lake to save him. Because one, you might die, and two, everything is controlled by God, therefore everything has an intention. So if you jump and save the boy, you might be interfering in God's plan. Therefore, the only solution to salvation, how do you make yourself good in the eyes of God? Don't do anything. God knows everything. God has a plan. Just obey the will of God. And the will of God means doing nothing. And in fact, doing nothing is the best thing you can do because if you are born of sin And you're only capable of sin, when you do nothing, you are doing good in the world. OK? So again, this is gaslighting, but this becomes the doctrine of the Catholic Church. And it begins what we call the Dark Ages. Because it forces people, and most people want salvation. Most people want to be good in the eyes of God. It forces people to be passive and obedient and unable to question and explore. OK? So any questions so far? Before I move on. Okay, let's look at another line from the sea of God. Does when man lives by the standard of man and not by the standard of God, he is like the devil. All right? Think about this. When you choose to follow your nature, you are like the devil. It is only by negating yourself. It is only by denying yourself, can you be good? All right? If you trust your instincts, if you trust your intuition, if you use your imagination, you are like the devil. Okay, this is exactly what he's saying with this sentence. The other thing that he does is he's very repetitive, so he'll keep on going like this for a very long time. All right? I mean, this is all just a repetition. Even an angel should not have lived by the angel standard but by God. So it's a stand firm in the truth and speak the truth that comes from God's truth, not the lie that derives from his own falsehood. Okay, even angels must live by God's standard. So only God has the power to choose. We can choose, but we can only do evil. So we should not choose. So the thing about August that's very important for us to understand is he studied rhetoric. And so he's very good at gaslighting. So twisting things in order to force your compliance. So he says, when men live for the standard of truth, He lives not by his own standard but by God. He's just repeating himself. Same sentence, but he's repeating over and over. So why is he doing this? Why is he doing this? And any thoughts? What is the city of God? The city of God, we, hmm? Sorry, I have to hear. Yeah. The city of God. Yeah. Is that the word? That's a great question. That's exactly it. Who is his audience? Exactly. His audience is clearly not for us or ordinary people, because at this time, most people don't read and write. So his audience is actually for the priesthood. His audience are for those individuals who are about to be anointed by the Catholic Church to preach to the laymen. And as a priest, you are forced to encounter a lot of theological issues. And so what Augustine is doing when writing Sedative God and Confessions is creating a rhetorical manual for the priests to basically gaslight their constituencies. Does that make sense? So think of this in many ways as the equivalent of the Confucian classics in China. So when you apply to become a bureaucrat in China, you have to take the Confucian examinations. And how do you pass examinations? by memorizing this crap. And if you think about it rhetorically, if you think of the underlying theories, it's really the same thing. The emperor is always right to steal the emperor once. So this is, in many ways, all it is is a rhetorical manual that priests have to memorize if they are to become anointed by the church. And once you memorize this, then whatever problems that you may encounter, you can just recite from this manual. And the main argument is, hey, we're born of sin, therefore you can do no good. Even by asking questions, you are exposed to the devil in yourself. Even by questioning a church. By asking me this question, you're showing the devil in you. and our responsibility. The only path salvation in this world is by fighting the devil within us. So focus your attention on the devil within you. Ignore the fact that the world is corrupt and evil. You know the fact that the landlord is exploiting you. You know the fact that the Catholic Church is stealing from you. Ignore that. That doesn't matter. What matters is the internal world in you. Life is a constant struggle against sin because the devil is in you. And you must purge the devil if you are to find salvation in God. So that's the logic of the argument. Any questions? Are we clear about this? It's not a sophisticated argument, but it's a clever argument that becomes a basis for the dominance of the Catholic Church during the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages. Now what he's gonna do, And this is very important is he's going to analyze the story of Adam and Eve. Okay? He's going to explore, why did this happen? Why did Adam and Eve in paradise? Why did they disobey God? All right, so let's look at his logic. It was in secret that the first human beings began to be evil. And the result was that they slipped into open disobedience. Okay? What this is saying is, why did they disobey? because Eve and Adam conspired in secret against God. Does that make sense? Okay, that's what he's saying here. It was in secret, okay? They conspired that the first human beings, Adam and Eve, began to be evil. It was because they talked to each other that they conspired to disobey God. For they would not have arrived at the evil act if an evil will had not receded it. Why did they do this evil act? Because they themselves were evil. That's important to understand. They were not tricked by the serpent. They were not curious. They were just evil. For pride is the start of every kind of sin. And what is pride except for longing for a perverse kind of exultation? They want to become God. The serpent told them that if you ate the fruit, you become God. That's what tethered them, the pride. For it is a perverse kind of exultation to abandon the basis on which the mind should be firmly fixed and to become, as it were, based on one self and so remain. What this is saying is pride means we are leaving God and becoming more of ourselves. Okay? There's two ways you can go. You can move towards God, which means to obey God, or you can move towards yourself, okay, which is to sin. This happens when a man is too pleased with himself, and a man is self-complacent when he deserts that changes good in which rather than him in himself he ought to have found dissatisfaction. Pride, okay? Pride makes us happy. It makes us ambitious. But it will blind us from God. This decision is voluntary for the will have been made by shaking its love of the higher changes good which shed on it light to see in Kino and it fire to love. It would not have been diverted from this love to follow its own pleasure. Okay? We abandoned God. And the will would not have been so darkened and chilled in consequence as that the woman believed that the serpent had spoken the truth and the man to put his wife's will above God's commandment. So here's the problem. The man listened to the woman. Adam was tricked by Eve. And it's supposed that this was a venial transgression when he refused to do his life's companion, even though the refuse to entail companionship in sin. So Adam was forced to make a decision. Eve had already eaten our fruit. So either Adam could follow God and disavow Eve, or he could follow her in sin. He followed her in sin, and that's why we are doomed. So what doomed Adam? What doomed Adam? It was love. He loved Eve. And that's why he decided that, yes, Eve is doomed. that I love her so I must do myself as well. That's why Adam ate the fruit, because he could not stand to leave Eve. He was bonded by his love. So what is this telling us? This is telling us that there's only one true love, and that's the love of God, which is obedience to God. Every other love, a love for each other, is a falsehood, okay? It is a lie. It can only lead us to sin and disaster. Now let me ask you a question. Who else said this? Love can only lead you to disaster. It is a disease. You must deny it. You must recognize it for the disease that it is. Who else said this? Virgil, right? Virgil. Virgil in the Indian, remember, talk about diddle. Now diddle fell in love with Ines. And Ines fell in love with diddle. But then the gods tell Ines, obey us, go to Italy so you may found Rome, which is your destiny. And Ineos, because he's a pious man, abandoned his love and did his duty. So he was honored by the gods. But Diddo became consumed by her love for Ineos. And so she committed suicide. She destroyed herself. Love will destroy you. Love will blind you. Love is evil. Okay? Only obedience is good. Let's continue. Does the evil act, the transition of even the forbidden fruit, was committed only when those who did it were already evil? That bad fruit could only come from bad tree. Further, the badness of the tree came about contrary to nature, because about a fault in the will, which is against nature, it certainly could not have happened. But only in nature could have nothing, could have to sort it by fault. Consequently, although the will derives its existence as a nature from its creation by God, it's falling away from its true being, it's due to creation out of nothing. So this raises a very important question for us. If it is true that we are born of sin, it is also true that God created us, then is that a contradiction? God is perfect. Why would God create a flawed, sinful person? And the answer is this, because God created us out of nothing. We are a creation out of nothing. In other words, we are a failed science experiment. We are in a science experiment garden wrong. He created, God created Adam out of dust. And he created Eve out of Adam. The Adam's rib basically, right? So he's creating us out of nothing. And this was an experiment. And because we were created out of nothing, we were born of sin. So the only path, the only way forward is for us to embrace God, to become more like God by obeying him and deny who we are. Because if we were to become more of who we are, if we listened to ourselves, if we loved, if we thought, if we were curious, if we moved into our nothingness, but the more we obey God, the more we move towards enlightenment and salvation. So that's the logic here. So he concludes, that is why humility. Humility just means self-denial, self-negation, complete obedience. Forget who you are, it doesn't matter. Just obey God, which is the Catholic Church. So God really means the Catholic Church. This is why humility is highly praised in the city of God, and especially enjoined on the city of God during the time of its pilgrimage in this world. And it receives particular emphasis in the character of Christ, the king of that city. We're also taught by the sacred scriptures that the thought of exaltation, pride, the contrary of humility, exercised supreme dominion in Christ's adversary, the devil, okay? So he's creating the economy. In the city of Rome, in the city of earth, pride triumphs because that's the seat of the devil. in the city of God, humility triumphs because that's a seat of Jesus. This is surely the great difference that shunders the two cities on which we are speaking. The one is community of the devout man, the other company of the religious and each has its own angels attached to it. And one city, love of God has been given first place in the other, love of self. pride, ego, will. All this is found in the city of Rome. But in the city of God, the only thing that exists is humility and love of God. Okay? Any questions so far? Yeah. Oh, that's a great question. Okay. So Jesus is dead and Jesus didn't really do anything because we're still born of sin. So why did God send Jesus? And the answer is to awaken us, to show us that there's been wrong and we must correct ourselves, to lend us, to show us the light. But it is we who must walk towards the light. Does that make sense? So we'll conclude with this passage. And this is towards the end of the city of God. In the headling city then, there will be freedom of will. So this is really curious because for the entire book, he's been talking about how freedom of will is bad because we're born of sin, right? It will be one and the same freedom in all and indivisible in the separate individuals. It will be freed from all evil and filled with all good and joying unfailingly the light of eternal joy, forgetting all fences, forgetting all punishments, okay? So what's the logic here? The logic is this. We are on earth, we are by ourselves. We are separate from God. But when we, when we, when instead of God, we will have to cheat, we union with God. We will return to God. We will be the same as God. God is in us and we are in God. And therefore we will be incapable of sin. And at that point, we will have complete freedom of will because our will is the same as God's. Okay? So I know that it's hard, life sucks on earth. You're getting exploited by the landlord. You're getting raped by the landlord. You're getting killed by your neighbors. Who knows, okay? Life sucks. But just focus on your internal salvation. Focus on obedience. Because when you do so, you will ascend to Jerusalem. And at that point, you will be one with God. And everything that you suffered on Earth will be forgotten. And it will just be endless paradise. You are making a sacrifice so that you may be saved. You're sacrificing yourself so that you may be saved. And this is a very powerful logic. Because this becomes the logic of many powerful movements throughout human history, including that of communism. Think about the logic here. Communism, what is communism? Communism is we work really hard today to build a socialist paradise. But once we build socialist paradise, we have complete freedom of will. We will be one and the same. We will be indivisible from each other. We will have complete freedom to do what we please. We can, as Mark says, we can fish in the afternoon and read in the evening and discuss politics with our friends whenever. We will have cheap paradise. So it's the power of the city of God. Not only does it provide a framework for the Catholic Church to assert dominion over all of Europe, but it becomes the catalyst for revolution in movements throughout human history, especially communism, but including other movements as well. Alright? So any questions? Okay, you want to know more about the biography of Augustine, okay? Alright, okay, I'll do so, but this is the very ending of the See of God, okay? So let's look at the ending together, and then I'll discuss the biography of Augustine. You will not forget its own liberation, nor be ungrateful to its liberator, okay? So we have escaped this world of evil and of sin, and we are with God, who are great liberator. It will remember even its past evils as far as intellectual knowledge is concerned. But it will utterly forget them as far as a sense experience is concerned. So what this means is, yes, we will remember the pain we suffered on earth, but the pain will mean nothing. We will remember what we experienced, but we will not remember the pain. It will be eternal paradise. No more pain, no more suffering, no more sin. For the highly trained physician is acquainted with almost all diseases as far as they can be known in theory, while it's ignorant of most of them in respect of personal experience, since he has not suffered from them. We will become God-like in our understanding. We will understand why we suffered, and then we will understand suffering means nothing, because we are now united with God. Does that make sense? So that's the logic of the sea of God in Augustine. All right, so now you wanna know who this guy is. All right, so there's a lot of controversy over who he is. In his biography, and again remember, if a biography is written by a politician, it's gonna be BS, all right? Just so you know. He tells us that he comes from a pretty normal family, his father's a pagan, His mother, Monica, is the devout Christian. And then through his own hard work, he started to study rhetoric in university. He became a professor of rhetoric. And then when he was converted, when he saw the light, when God spoke to him, when he had his Damascus moment, he started to send the Bible rigorously. And then he was spotted by his talent, by the church. And at 42, he was appointed to become the Bishop of Hippo, which is in northern Africa. And he was in that position until his death. One thing that Augustine is known for is the fact that he's prolific. Prolific. Which meant that he wrote a lot of books. It's possible he wrote hundreds of thousands of pages. And his two most famous are Confessions in the city of God. So most people, most scholars, take his story for what it is. They believe him. But one thing that you learn in this class is to always be skeptical of power. So at age 42, he's appointed the head of the church in this region. What does it tell us? It tells us that he comes from an extremely powerful family. Because one thing that you learn in this class is the way that Catholic Church grew, the way that Christian A. grew, is by marrying itself to power. Christianity had a very strict hierarchy, and that enabled it to be co-opted by the power elite. So this tells us the fact that he was appointed bishop, that he comes from an extremely powerful family. It's possible his father was a governor, a Roman governor, was possible a general. But this is not a typical normal middle class family. It can't be. Does that make sense? That's the first thing. Second thing is he was prolific, which meant he wrote a lot. Now in our class, there was also another individual who was extremely prolific. And who was that person? Meaning that he wrote a lot, like way too much. This person is Aristotle. The thing that we said about Aristotle is he was a censor, a propagandist for the Macedonian empire. who was trying to justify the supremacy of crystallization. And so when he wrote, he probably didn't write anything by himself, but he had a team of students around him who wrote everything for him. So you can surmise this thing in Augustine. As Bishop, he had hundreds of scribes, hundreds of priests who basically took his theories and turned them into books. And that's how he was able to be so prolific. So think of him as a professor basically. and a university professor, a science professor who's in charge of a lab. He doesn't actually do his own work. He has assistance for that, but he's the one directing the research and the writing. You can also see him as a propagandist. Does that make sense? But he's clearly a genius. There's no denying he is a genius. Any more questions? Even though this is all genius, It's only because they're an empire and they can gaslight their people. Okay? So the logic is basically like this. The logic is I push you down and you turn around and says, hey, why did you push me down? And I say to you, I didn't push you down, you slipped. There's a difference. All right? I can do that because I'm powerful and you're not. So this is really the logic of empire. All right? Augustine is really using the logic of empire. And he's trying to force people to be obedient, right? Because obedient leads to salvation. Hey, you can disobey me. You can fool around. But this means you'll burn in hell for all eternity. Do you really want to take that chance? Most people don't, OK? So most people during most of this time choose to be compassive in order to avoid sin. And this will mark the beginning of the dark ages in Europe. But there are many people who choose to rebel. There are many who believe that exploration, curiosity, intuition, imagination is fundamental to being human. If you refuse to let me be human, then I will go somewhere else. So where do they go? Well, they go east. They go east. The two places. The first is the Sassanian Persian Empire. But another place to go that's very interesting is Arabia. Why do they go into Arabia? Because Arabia is basically like a lawless desert. There's no real authority in the desert. And there are lots of Jewish people and Christians who escaped Arabia in order to practice their faith. One thing that you will learn in this class, or that you have learned in this class, is that people think their faith very seriously. I rather die than not practice my faith. So all these people are going to the desert in order to practice their faith. Why is this important? Because from Arabia will come a new religion called Islam. So these are the people who will give birth to a revolutionary new religion called Islam that will challenge the authority of the Catholic Church in Augustine. And this is what we will discuss next class."}

So today we do Dante. And Dante really is the height of civilization. It does not get better than Dante. I've taught Dante for three years now. This is my third time teaching Dante. And what's amazing about it is that all students love Dante. But also each time I teach Dante, I'm able to discover new insights about Dante that I didn't realize before. My theory is that Dante is someone you can spend your entire life studying, and you will never truly understand his power, his truth, his beauty. So we will spend two classes on Dante today and next Tuesday, and this will end the first semester. Dante is extremely complicated. I can only give you a glimpse into how wonderful he is, these next two classes. All right, so let me give you a quick introduction into Dante. All right, so his book, his approach is called the Commedia, the comedy. It's not called the D'Oran comedy. D'Oran comedy is something that we call it later on. that he first referred to as the Comedia. Why is it called the comedy? Well, because in writing epics, there are two styles. There's the tragic or high, and there's the comic or low. Tragic means, tragic high means that it usually deals with gods and kings, and is written in extremely sophisticated style. Comic lo means that it deals with ordinary people and written in a common vernacular. At this period in European history, this is the year 1308 to 1321, okay? Those are the 13 years that he spends writing the comedy and he will die after he finishes it. At this point in European history, The high language is Latin. And what Donnie does, which is very interesting, is he chooses to write it in Tuscan. And this is, of course, the local language of Florence, where he is from. And because the Commedia is so wonderfully produced, Tuscan will become the official language of the Italian peninsula. So in Chile and Italy, they speak the Tuscan dialect of the language. The divine comedy, it is an epic, divided into three structures. Dante goes on a spiritual journey into the cosmos in order to seek truth, to seek God. He starts off with a midlife crisis. And so he has a guy named Virgil who takes him through inferno, okay? And then they go to purgatory. And then he goes to paradise. Paradise is heaven, inferno is hell, and purgatory is the land, the mountain, in between the inferno and paradise. Today we will look at the very ending of the Divine Comedy, Cantal 33. And I want to set up the poem, okay? give some context and some background. Dante is in paradise, and he's trying to figure out the spiritual truth underlying the universe. And then as he goes on this journey, he concludes his journey by meeting God. But the problem of God is no one knows what it is. It's a mystery. It's the biggest mystery in the universe. What is God? God is there, right there. but no one knows what it is. God is surrounded by a heavenly host. These are angels that have proved themselves worthy to be around God. And these include people like Mary, the mother of Jesus, as well as Rachel and Leah, who we learn about when we did the Hebrew Bible. And they have absolutely no idea who God is either. Okay? They're in a place called the Epirium. And Dante is being guided by a man named Bernard, an angel. Okay, Saint Bernard. And to the left, to the left is God. And he is this pristine ball of light. No one knows what it is. Not even God knows what it is. And over here is the host, okay? And at the very center is Mary. What is amazing about the Viscomony is how Dante restructures Christian theology. Remember in Christian theology, Jesus is the epicenter. But in Dante's rendering of Christian theology, Mary is at the center. And the reason why is, I should start this question, is it a great miracle that a God could come to earth to earth and die for our sins? Or is it a greater miracle that a mortal woman is able to give birth to a god? OK? This is something that, if you think about it, it's kind of shocking and bewodering. And that's what happens during the divine comedy. There are two literary devices that Darnit will use throughout the divine comedy. The first is the idea of paradox. Think of paradox as a puzzle. Okay? What is the sound of one hand clapping? Okay, a paradox. A truth that seems like a contradiction. He will use this all the time. And the other is structure. Okay? The divine comedy, it is mathematically precise. It is brilliant. It is a hundred contos. And there's so much mathematics within the divine comedy. comedy. So to use a metaphor, you can see divine comedy as almost as an intellectual jigsaw puzzle. The human mind does not like contradictions. The human mind does not like paradoxes. So what happens is this, if you are to engage with the divine comedy, you become enthralled in it. You become obsessed with it. And then what happens is your Your mind will slowly over time, all by itself. You actually don't have to do anything, okay? Your mind will start to unravel these paradoxes and create a new truth of the universe. And so we are talking about the creation for the Divine Comedy of a new mind for humanity. If Homer was the father of Western civilization, then Dante is the father of modern European civilization. And the reason why is that the vine comedy, because it is a jigsaw puzzle that will unravel the truths of the universe, it becomes an intellectual blueprint for three major movements in Europe. The first is the Renaissance. Remember the Renaissance starts in Florence, right? Second is the Protestant Reformation, a religious revolution against the Catholic Church. And the third is the Sainte Revolution, okay? I will show you today why that's the case. How implanted or imprinted in the poetry are the seeds of these three major revolutions. Okay, any questions so far? before we look at the Vain Comedy. So, first thing to know about the Vain Comedy is that it is part of a literary genre called apocalyptic literature. Apocalyptic literature just means God reveals the truth to us through a prophet or a poet. So this is Ezekiel, which is one of the earliest books of the Hebrew Bible. And this really starts the tradition. And so what happens is Ezekiel, he is an Israelite prophet, and he goes to heaven, where he meets all these monsters and demons and angels, and he meets God himself. And then God gives him a scroll, puts it in his mouth, says, eat it. And he eats it, and he returns to earth to tell the Israelites the words of God. And so this starts the idea that a prophet is someone who speaks the word of God. Okay? He said to me, this is God, Yahweh. O mortal, eat what is offered to you. Eat the scroll and go. Speak to the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth and he gave me the scroll to eat. In my mouth, it was as sweet as honey. Okay? So this is the idea of the upper-class tradition. What Dante will do is completely overturn this tradition. Okay, okay, okay, yeah, next slide. All right, so before we look at the vine comedy, let's review Augustine, because as we discussed previously, Augustine, the city of God, is what starts the Dark Ages, dark ages, right? Because of the way that the world is presented. Okay? So let's look at a few quotes from the city of God to remind ourselves of what the mentality of the dark ages was. First, when men lives by the standard man and not by the standard of God, he is like the devil. Okay? And the idea here is that the devil is within us. We must constantly fight against our own nature if we are to be with God. Okay? Second is, now could anything but pride have been the start of the evil will? And the idea here is, if left to our own devices, we will strive to be like God. Pride in the city of God is used almost synomously like the word ego, okay? Basically who we are. We humans are born proud and will strive for Godhood if we are allowed to. Third is, His was a venial transgression when he refused to desert his wife's companion. So he talked about the story of Adam and Eve. Eve was clearly the disobedient one, right? But Adam, why did he eat the fruit because he didn't want to abandon Eve. Therefore, love is sin. Okay? If you love, you will commit sin. You cannot trust love. It is because Adam loved Eve that he ate the fruit and condemned humanity. Although the will derives its existence as a nature from its creation by God, it's falling away from its true being, is due to its creation out of nothing. It's creation out of nothing. So the question then is, if God created us, why are we so bad? And the answer is, because God created us out of dust. He created us out of nothing. That's why we are so flawed. Again, we are a failed science experiment. We see then that the two cities were created by two kinds of love. The earthly city was created by self-love, reaching the point of contempt for God, the heavenly city by the love of God. When we love ourselves, we create evil. When we love God, we do good. And the last one. In the heavenly city, then there will be freedom of will. Okay, this is a hard idea to understand. What does it mean to have freedom of will in the city of heaven? It means that in heaven we will discard our bodies and only our souls will remain. The body is flawed because it's created out of dust, out of nothing. But the soul is perfect because it was breathed into by God. Once we are freed of our bodies, we have no more desire. We don't want to have sex. We don't want to eat. We don't want to fight. our emotions will all be dissipated. Therefore, we will be perfect. Okay? And what will be left are to enjoy, unfailingly, the delight of eternal joys. Okay? We will be one with God, and we will know an eternal bliss. That's what we're striving towards. Okay? Salvation. Everything on earth does not matter. Okay? So it is a negation of human will. It is a contempt for human love. It is a distress of all human agency. And these ideas are what will lead to the dark ages. Dante is trying to rebut Augustine and free us from the dark ages. Okay? So let's go to Dante. And remember, Dante will be a rebuttal to all these ideas. All right, let's go. This is the Imperium, the final level in the structure of the Divine Comedy. And Dante has a mission. His mission is to meet God and tell us who God is. Because God doesn't know and neither does all the other angels around him. And the reason why is, if God is omniscient and omnipresent, if he knows everything and he is everywhere, then God by definition lacks an imagination. This is hard, I don't understand, but I'll explain it, okay? God does not know who he is because he lacks an imagination. All right, so what's happening is this. Bernard and Dante are together and they're staring at Mary because Bernard will invoke the love of Mary to empower Dante to see God, okay? So he's trying to channel Mary's energy to empower Dante and not only is Bernard doing this, but everyone. The entire heaven is praying to Mary to empower Dante. Okay, all right. Virgin mother, daughter of your son, more humble and sublime than any creature, fixed gold decree from all eternity. You are the one who gave to human nature so much nobility that its creator did not disdain his being, made its creature. Okay, right away, what you will see in Divine Comedy is paradox after paradox. Virgin Mother is a paradox, right? A mother who gives birth without having sex. Daughter of your son is a paradox. A creature from its creator is also a paradox. And you will see this in Divine Comedy all the time, these paradoxes. Then this is the paradox, okay? You are the one who gave the human nature so much nobility that it's greater than that that's being made its creature. If we agree with Augustine and say and believe that everyone is born in sin and we are incapable of redeem ourselves from our sin and how to explain Mary, right? Mary gave birth to Jesus. If Mary had sin then God had sinned in him. How do you explain that? Well the only explanation is Mary gave birth without sin. Therefore, she clansors of her sin before giving birth to Jesus. And how did she do that? A mother's love for her child. So this is what Donnie said. Love is about sin. Love cannot have sin. No. I mean, you hear this and you're like, no, that doesn't make any sense. Let's just say that I love this woman. She's beautiful. And I say to her, I love you. Will you marry me? And then she says to me, I will. I will, but I want $10 million. So I go and rob a bank, right? That's love, right? What Don is saying is that's not love. That is not love. Ask yourself this question. If your mother and your child says to you, mother, I only love you if you let me eat chocolate every day, is that love? As a mother, you will say back to him, I love you, therefore I will not allow you chocolate every day. I care about your health. I care about your happiness. That's what I care about. I don't want to degrade you. That's what Donny is saying here. Love is the ultimate power. And because she clans herself, she has so much nobility that she was able to give birth to God. That's where nobility is. Nobility is not in being free of sin, but redeeming yourself from sin through sheer will power, through love. Let's continue. All right, this man, this is Dante of course, who from the deepest hollow in the universe, he gave him hell, okay? Up through this height has seen the lives of spirits one by one, now please, okay? He's been on this amazing spiritual journey. He's seen everyone through grace to grant him so much virtue that he may lift his vision higher still, may lift it toward the ultimate salvation. The ultimate salvation is God, right? But look at this phrase, vision higher still. Okay, what does it mean? It means, hey, you cannot see God. You have to imagine God. God is something that you do not see. God is something that you imagine through your will. All right, next one please. Thank you. And I, who never burned for my own vision more than I burned for his. This is radical. This is Bernard. He is the highest of the angels. says, his vision, I burn for his vision. I want to know the truth. And only this man, Dante, can give us the truth, even though we are angels. Only Dante, a mortal man, has access to truth. We angels do not have access to truth. This is radical and revolutionary. Okay? And honestly, if the Catholic Church actually could understand any of this, then Dante would have, his manuscripts would have been burned, okay? This is, this is a idea. Do offer you all my prayers and pray that they may not fall short, that with your prayers you may despair all the clouds of his mortality so that the highest joy be his to see. The clouds of his mortality basis basically means his fear, his doubt. Okay. This to O'queen who can do what you would, I ask of you that after such a vision his sentiments preserve their perseverance. Preserve the perseverance just means he's able to remember what he saw. Okay. So imagination Imagination is one thing. You can imagine God, but then you must turn this imagination into a memory. And what is radical about this is that our most advanced neuroscientists, our most advanced scientists who understand how the brain works, they will tell you exactly how the brain works. You imagine the world and then over time you turn the world into a story and the story becomes your memory. So 800 years before, Donnie knew our neuroscience, how our brain actually works. Next slide please, thank you. And I was now narrowing him, who was the end of desires as I ought, lived my longing towards ardent limit. Now Donnie's turning towards God. Now's the time for him to experience God for the first time. But not with signaling. He smiled to me to turn my eyes on high. But I already was doing what he wanted me to do. because my sight, becoming pure, was able to penetrate the ray of light more deeply, that light, sublime, which in itself is true. From that point on, what I could see was greater and then speech can show. At such a sight, it fails. And memory fails when faced with such excess. He is, he's been blinded, okay? His mind is being blown apart. He does not know what he's seeing. It is so vast. It is so beautiful. It's so powerful. that he's being blinded. Okay, okay, next slide please. In his profound ending I saw in gather and bound my love into one single volume. What in the universe seems separate, scattered, substances, accidents, and dispositions as it can join in such a way that what I tell is only rudimentary? What he's seeing is this. He's seeing God as the universe before the Big Bang. When the universe was this pool of substances that was chaotic, okay? And then the Big Bang released all of it into the universe, creating our universe. Thawney is experiencing God as the universe before the Big Bang. And he's seeing how everything is connected. But he's immortal. He cannot connect all the pieces. He does not know what he's seeing. He just knows what he's seeing is so vast and interconnected, okay? All right, any questions so far? All right, are we clear about what's happening? Okay, keep on going. So is my mind completely wrapped in tent, steadfast and motionless, gazing, and it will get goo evermore in kindle as it watch, okay? So he's meditating. He's trying all his life for this one moment and he's trying his best. Whoever sees that light is soon made such that it would be impossible for him to see that light aside for other sight. He's a good, the object of the will is fully gathered in that light. Outside that light, what there is perfect is defective. God is good. There is very goodness, is in God. So think back to Plato. Goodness, it's encapsulated in body and God. It is what is perfect and good. What little I recall is to be told from this point on, in words, more weak than those of one whose infant tongue still babes at the breast. So this is complicated. What he's saying is this. This is now 10, 20 years after his experience of God. And what he's doing is he's sitting by himself trying to write down what he saw. He spent the past 10, 20 years writing the divine comedy to share with the world the truth of God. And so it's not that experience, okay? That is now gone. It is now his imagination of that experience, all right? And not because more than one simple semblance was in the living light at which I gaze, for it is always what it was before. But through my sight, which as I gaze grew stronger, that so apparent, even as I altered, seemed to be changing in the deep and bright. Okay, can you continue, please? Essence of that exalted light. Three circles appeared to me. They had three different colors, but all of them were of the same dimension. Okay, so he spent 20 years trying to figure out what he saw. And now he's able to slowly put the Tixel puzzle together. And what he sees are three circles. And this, of course, is the Holy Trinity. So he's figured it out. He's figured that the very essence of the universe, the very foundation of the universe is the Holy Trinity. One circle seemed reflected by the second, as rainbow is by rainbow, and a third seem fire breath equally by those two circles. Separate but equal. These are separate, but they're the same, the whole eternity. How incomplete is speech, how weak when set against my thought, and this to what I saw is such, to call it little is too much. He's figured it out. Next one, please. But he keeps on looking. What does he see? Eternal light, you only dwell within yourself and only you know you. knowing, self-known, you love and smile upon yourself. That circle which be gone and so appeared in you as light reflected. When my eyes had watched it with attention for some time within itself and colored like it in itself to me seemed painted with our effigy. Effigy. So that my sight was set on it completely. There's a problem here. Effigy means a mirror image. Okay? What do you think is this? Within the Holy Trinity there is an image of us. We are in God. We are at the very essence of God. We are within God. How is that possible? This should not be happening. This is the deepest, darkest secret of the universe now. How is it that a human is within God itself That should not be possible. We are separate. God is good, we are evil. That's what Augustine told us. Keep on going. As the Geometer intently seeks to square the circle, if you want to know where the phrase square the circle comes from, it comes from this, okay? But he cannot reach through thought on thought, the principle he needs. So it's a paradox. He can't figure it out. This is the ultimate paradox. He cannot figure what's going on. So I search that strange site. I wish to see the way in which our human effigy stood a circle and found place in it. How is it we are in God? What is going on here? And my own wings were far too weak for that. Okay, so he's been for the past 20 years trying to figure out why this is the case. But then my mind was struck by light that flashed and with this light we see what it had been asked. He now has an inspiration. He now can imagine what God is. He now knows the answer. He knows the answer. He's figured out the universe. He's figured it out. Okay, and this is it. Here, force failed my high fantasy, but my design will were moved already. Like a wheel revolving uniformly by the love that moves the sun and the other stars. Uh-oh, this is the ending guys. He doesn't tell us anything. He doesn't tell us what he saw. Okay. We spent, I don't know, years reaching this point and Don has figured it out and he's not gonna tell us. Why won't he tell us? Because it's a jigsaw puzzle, right? Because it's something that you have to figure out for yourself. This thing only works if you spend the time putting the pieces together, okay? And it's a lifetime journey. Don has spent 20 years doing this, okay? So I encourage you all to go on this journey. But you don't want, this journey is way too long. So I'll give you the my version of the Jigsaw puzzle answer today. It may not be the best answer. It may not be even the right answer. But it is an answer to what Donte is saying. Remember, this is a mystery. This is a paradox. This is a puzzle. It's something that you will have to unravel for yourself. But I will tell you my understanding. OK. So let's go back to the beginning of Paradise. And this is when Dante is with Beatrice. Who is Beatrice? Beatrice is someone that Donde has loved all his life. They met when they were 10 years old and their families were friends. But unfortunately Beatrice came from a very wealthy, high status family. And Donde was wealthy, but not as wealthy as Beatrice's family. So Beatrice was betrothed to someone of her social status. And she died when she was 24 giving birth. Okay? Donde never forgot about her. She wrote poetry after poetry, reminiscing about her, celebrating her. He wrote a vine comedy for her. And to basically pay him back. She invited to visit him in heaven, okay? So now they're in heaven. And you would think like, okay, they don't have in, they love each other. They can do whatever they want. Maybe they'll have sex. Maybe they'll just snuggle. Maybe they'll, I don't know, it's chocolate, who knows, okay? But what they do is they start asking themselves questions about the universe. They're in heaven and they want to know about the secrets of the universe. How do the stars work? How does the moon work, okay? So this is what Beatrice says to Dante. Do I care mine to God in gratefulness? She said, Beatrice, he has brought us to the first star, which is the moon, okay? In this cosmology, the first star is the moon. I answered, with the most devotion I can summon, I thank him who has brought me far from the mortal world. But now tell me, okay? The first thing he does is, hey, I wanna ask you a question. What are the dark marks on this planet's body? Okay? Why is, where are the dark marks on the moon? Next slide please. Okay, so they talk and Beatrice says, your mortal mind can't possibly comprehend the truth. But try. Tell me what you think causes the dark spots on the moon. And Donny answers, what seems to us diverse up here is caused, I think, by matter, dense and rare. What does he mean by this? Let me explain. What he's saying is this. The moon has parts that are dense and rare. Dense just means there's lots of rocks. Weir means there's an opening. So light will pass through what is rear, what is hollow. And so it becomes dark. But light will hit dense parts like mountains and it'll be reflected back. And that's why there are dark spots on the moon. And this is the generally accepted theory. But Beatrice says, no, no, no. You're wrong. You're absolutely wrong. There are two possible explanations for this. The first explanation is the moon, there's some parts that are completely hollow. Light just passes completely through. But then ask yourself a solar eclipse. In a solar eclipse, the moon is able to cover the sun completely, right? But in a solar eclipse, there should be some light that if the moon, there are some parts of the moon that is hollow, there should be some holes in the solar eclipse, right? And then she's like, okay, then your theory is, There's some caverns in the moon that go deep. OK? But I'm going to show you that's not the case either. In the spiritual universe, he's not talking about the physical universe. He's talking about the spiritual universe. All light reflects brightly, no matter where it is, because light comes from the essence of God. OK? Move on. All right. So can you skip this, please? OK. You can skip this as well, actually. All right. So then she just says this, okay, you don't believe me. So here's what you're gonna do. We will do an experiment. Guys, they're in heaven and they're in an experiment. Why? Because Donnie doesn't believe her. Donnie thinks she's full of crap, okay? So she says, let's do an experiment, right? This is not a revolution. If you don't believe someone, do an experiment. All right? It's okay to doubt. The doubt is heavenly, it's divine. Yet an experiment were you to try could free you from your cavell. If the cavell is all light reflects just as brightly as anywhere, okay? And the source of your art course brings from experiment. Taking three mirrors, okay? This is experiment. You guys can actually do this at home as well. Place a pair of them at equal distance from you, set the third in midway between those two, but further back. then turning toward them at your back half place, a light that kindles those three mirrors and returns to you, reflected by the maw. Although the image in the father's glass will be of lesser size, there you will see that it must match the brightness of the rest. So here's experiment. There's a candle, there's a candle, and there's three mirrors. The third is the father's. Within, and you're holding the candle, within the three candles, are these images of you holding the candle. Now, in the third mirror, you'll be smaller. What Beatrice is saying is, the candle will just be as bright. Is that true physically? It is true physically, okay? You can actually do this at home. Now, what's really fun about this experiment is, you can keep on going. This is the first layer, right? Let's do another layer. Okay? Let's do another layer. five mirrors all back, okay? Are they still as bright, the candle? The answer is yes. How about a third layer? Okay. Are they just as bright? The answer is yes. Let's go a million layers. Will they just be as bright as the first candle? The answer is yes. That's experiment. It shows, it proves that no matter how far, how far the candle is, if it is reflected by the first candle, it will just be as bright as the other candles. All right? That's experiment. Sorry, hold on. Now, guys, let me ask you this question. What is this? You remember? It's a God head. It's what Donny saw when he experienced God. You remember, he saw three circles, and inside were three humans, an aphage. This is experiment, okay? So he's telling us that God is that candle that burns in you and reflects the ultimate good. It reflects the good and it burns in everyone and it unifies everyone together. The more you love the brother that candle burns and the brother that candle burns the closer you are to God. When you love you experience God. That is why you are without sin when you love. Okay, this is the God hand. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, go back. All right, sorry, can you go back please? Okay, sorry, next slide. All right, next slide. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Forward, yes, okay. This is the end, all of the divine comedy. All right, let's read it again. Now that we have this information, here forespelt my high fantasy, But my desire and will were moved already like a will revolving uniformly by the love that moves the sun and the other stars. He tells us here, God is love, love is God. Love is the universe, it's the force that binds everything together. It is the unifying force of the universe. It is the force that makes things move brightly. The problem is, before we could only see, But now, we can now imagine. OK? God is something you cannot see. God is something that you must imagine. OK? So that's the divine comment. Any questions about this so far? That's a really good question. Who is he writing to? Who is his audience? So he's writing in Tuscan rather than Latin. And he calls it the Commedia. So I think he's trying to avoid the Catholic Church, because at this time, the Catholic Church writes mainly in Latin. So he's trying to avoid the Catholic Church. That doesn't mean any of me. Because if the Catholic Church actually understood what he was doing, they would have basically burned his manuscript. So I know it sounds strange, but he's really writing for the universe. If that makes any sense, he's leaving it here as a secret box. And then someone in the future is going to come, and they're going to read it. And it's going to entice them. It's like they're curious as to what this is. And at first they can't figure it out. But they stick at it. And over time, it begins to transform how they see the world. Does that make sense? He's a prophet. He's a poet. And so he's not really writing it to make money or because he has to. He's writing it because he has a moral mission to speak the truth. When you speak the truth, you're speaking to the universe, not to an individual, all right? Yeah, yeah, no, no, sorry, sorry, yeah, thank you, yeah. Okay, so, okay. At this time, remember before we said that all writing projects have to be sponsored by a patron and before it was Kings. So he does have a patron. It's like a count or something. And clearly, there are parts in the Divine Comedy, which are appealing to his patron. But he's really using this as a pretext in order to speak the truth. Does that make sense? He needs funding. He needs a patron. But what drives him is obviously not the money. What drives him is he believes God has spoken to him and he believes that he knows God. He believes that in the divine comedy are the secrets of the universe. He himself probably doesn't know all the secrets, but he believes that they're all there if someone is willing to look hard enough. Doesn't make sense, okay? But you're right, he did have a picture, yep. Okay, any more questions? Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay, so there have been multiple translations of the Vine comedy. This man is named Alan Menable. And he's the one I prefer the most just because he's the most relatable. He's the most accessible. I mean, there are these translations by Longfellow which is beautiful, but it's really complicated. I think extra pound has also done a translation, and then there are translations which arrive, okay? So there are different translations. Minimum is, I think, just the easiest to teach, okay? And so because of translation issues, this again was written in Tuscan. I tried to avoid a closed reading, okay? because with closed reading, you want to analyze the word specifically, the diction. But I can't do that because it depends on the translation. But the ideas are the same. But thanks. So this is menable. We'll do a lot of closed reading when we get to English literature, which is like Shakespeare and Milton. Because then you could actually do closed reading. But with translation, you can't do closed reading. It's too dependent on the translation. Any more questions? Okay, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, Because we know, okay? Our hearts will know. Your faces will know. People will know. Everyone knows what good is. Pride will be the start of the evil will. No, pride is who we are. We all strive to be better. His was a venial transgression when he refused to desert his life companion. Life, love is sin. Love is wealth sin. Love is the greatest force in the universe because it is God. We're created out of nothing. No, we're created out of God, okay? God is in us. God is with us. The heavenly city was created by self-love. The love of God was created by contempt of self. All right, so this is a really important idea, but the idea is this. Love only exists between humans. It doesn't exist outside of humans. You cannot love money. You cannot love money. You cannot love chocolate. You cannot only love each other because God is within us, okay? If you love God, you don't love God because God is an idea. You have to love each other. You have to love Beatrice. You have to love your mother. at the love of your son. OK? In that, we say there'll be freedom of will, enjoying, unfilling the delight of eternal joys. Sorry, guys. OK? Divine Comedy says this. There is no end to the universe. At no point will we know everything. We exist because we are a continued God's legacy. When we imagine things, we are engaged in the act of creation. That is God. We are like God. and when we imagine, when we love. That is our ultimate mission in life, to love and to imagine. Because then we create new worlds for God to celebrate. OK? All right. All right. So that was the first lecture on Dante. Next Tuesday, we will do the second. OK?"}

Traditionally we've understood journalism and research as this method of just collecting information, organizing it and then expressing it. But then along came a man named Gay to Lease and he transformed journalism. He transformed the way we understood research. Okay, so we created something called literary journalism. Which is the idea that journalism can be by itself be literature. The Gage Lewis method is going to teach us how to be creative, how to be imaginative, and how to engage with reality and engage with people. Because we don't teach you this in school. In fact, we teach you the opposite. Don't explore. Just do what the teacher tells you to do. We didn't learn this. Well, he looked at this at home. The reason why is that his father was a tailor. His father was a tailor and he had a tailoring business in New Jersey and his mother took care of the business while his father made the clothes. So what does Hathu do with exploration and reflection? Well, his mother was responsible for the business aspects. So these very wealthy people would come to the shop and order very nice suits. And her job was to deal with them. But it's actually very hard to deal with rich people. They made me very demanding. So her strategy was to become their friend. And how do you become someone's friend? What do you do in order to become someone's friend? What must you do? Wrong, not talk, the opposite. Listen, okay, you understand? So, in the family living room, the mother would just sit down on her couch talking with these very wealthy people. And she would talk to us by listening. Okay? So her strategy for this is that I am interested in you. So that's how she became friends with all these very wealthy people, even though she or something was not wealthy. Because she had a mindset that whoever came into her living room, whoever was a client, was first and foremost a friend. And she was interested in this person. He was interested in people. So he would spend hours and hours just listening to that person talk and talk and talk. And so you can say that this is exploration, curiosity, exploration. But in the other room, the father would by himself sit and work on the clothes, right? I'm not sure if you've seen Taylor's work, they are very precise, they are very exact, they are very meticulous, They're very disciplined, they're very patient. So we can spend days and days in this room just working on a piece of suit, right? This is the idea of reflection. The pursuit of perfection. So exploration is the pursuit of curiosity and reflection is the pursuit of perfection. This is the Gay Tilees, this is the Gay Tilees research method. This is what I'll be teaching you. This is something that will not just help you become a better writer, but someone who will be much more creative and a much more effective researcher. So even if you are going to a scientist, I guarantee you that the skills you'll be learning in this class will help you wherever you go. I want you to go around Beijing and take pictures and get the idea is contrast. Remember that here he says New York is a city of things I noticed. New York is a city of contrast. I want you to do the same thing for Beijing. Take your camera and take pictures of things that other people would not notice, okay? And take pictures of things that are contrast of each other."}

We are continuing the Hebrew Bible today. Last class we talked about King David of Israel and how he created the Bible, the project of the Bible in order to create legitimacy and authority. Okay, we are continuing along this theme today. So let's go over the chronology of the Bible. Okay? So in the beginning, there was God. In the Bible, his name is Yahweh. And he created the world. And then he created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And people who took the Bible literally believed this was about 4,000 BC. As we know, Adam and Eve, because they disobeyed God, they were banished from the Garden of Eden. And they had two sons, Ken and Abel, and then their family start to populate the earth. But then humans start to misbehave. We went to war, we were greedy, and so God decided to destroy the world instead of calling the great flood. And this is a story of Noah's Ark. Remember, Noah was beloved by God, so God told him to build a great ship and then he'll be able to live. After Noah's Ark came along a man named Abraham. And this was about 2000 BCE. Abraham was born in the city of Ur in Mesopotamia. And he was beloved by God because he was a righteous and decent man. And God made a covenant with him. Covenant. And a covenant is a contract. It's a promise. And the contract is this. If you, Abraham, swear allegiance to me, Yahweh, I will make you and your descendants founders of a great nation called Israel that will stretch from the Nile to the Euphrates. That's a promised land. And return as a mark of this covenant, Abraham and his ancestors will engage in circumcision. Basically the foreskin of their penis will be surgically removed at birth. So that's the covenant. Abraham had a son named Isaac, and Isaac had a son named Jacob. Jacob is the younger son of Isaac, so Asol should have inherited the birthright and the blessing from his father Isaac. But Jacob played a trick on Asol and stole the birthright. Asol was very angry, so Jacob had to run away and live with a relative for a couple decades. And while there he married two sisters named Leah and Rachel. And then together they had 12 sons. And these became, the 12 sons became the 12 founders of the 12 tribes of Israel. Jacob will be renamed by God as Israel. So Jacob really is the founder of the nation of Israel. young son is named Joseph. And he is beloved by Jacob so much that his brothers became jealous of him and sold him into slavery in Egypt. Joseph was also beloved by God and he has a special gift of reading dreams. He became a special advisor to the Pharaoh and he became very wealthy. Meanwhile, back in the land of Israel, Jacob and his sons, their family, are facing this massive famine. So Joseph comes and rescues them and the entire nation of Israel moves down to Egypt, where they become very wealthy and prosperous. And because they have many children, eventually after a couple of decades they become a threat to the establishment. So the new Thero who has no memory of the contributions of Joseph enslaved the Israelites and he wants them to die. So he basically forbids them to have sons and he basically tries to sanction the Israelites as much as possible. Eventually a man named Moses is born into the Israelites in Egypt And because he's a boy, he has to be killed. So his mother puts him in a basket, and then this basket drifts down the Nile and into the hands of the Egyptian princess. So Moses grows up to become an Egyptian prince. But eventually, God informs him of who he really is and he's the prophet who will deliver the Israelites back into the Promised Land. The Pharaoh refuses to let the Israelites go. There's a major contest, duel, between Moses and the Pharaoh. And then God sends down like 10 plagues, okay, 10 plagues, to force the Pharaoh to release the Israelites. Moses is taking the Israelites into the Promised Land. And then Pharaoh has to change their heart and he wants to destroy the Israelites before they can escape. So the Pharaoh chases them. Moses causes the sea to part. They cross the valley, and when Pharaoh and his army are about to enter the sea, the sea closes in on them and drowns them. And then when Moses and the Israelites are in a desert, Moses ascends the mountain to receive the law of God. And this is what we call the Ten Commandments. But while Moses is away, the Israelites create an idol to celebrate Yahweh. And Yahweh hates this because Yahweh does not want to be represented on earth. So Yahweh sent him to a long exile in the desert. And he tells Moses, you will deliver the people from Egypt, and that is your mission, but you will not enter the Promised Land. You can see the Promised Land, but you will not enter the Promised Land. So the mission goes to Joshua, who is Moses' disciple. And Joshua and the Israelites start a massive military campaign into the land of Cannae, which is a Promised Land. And over the span of years, they basically massacre the people, and they create the nation of Israel. And then we enter the period called the Judges. And these are 12 individuals who who become the tribal leaders of Israel. And Israel at this time is at war with all the neighbors, the Moabites, the Edomites, the Philistines, the Kennenites. And this period lasted a long time until the Israelites picked a king named Saul to lead them. King Saul. And then as we know from King Saul will come David who will use up the throne from Saul and be the great king of Israel that we remember today. And David is considered the real founder of the city of Israel as well as the Jewish faith. So that's the chronology of the Bible. Now, because the Bible is written almost like a historical document, for most of human history, people believe this to be literally true. Okay? But in the past 400 years, 300 years, there are many archaeologists who have tried to prove the events in the Bible. For example, Noah's Ark. If there really was a flood, well, there will be a geological record. There will be a ship. Okay? There will be a memory of this. But there was never, but we have never been able to find any concrete evidence to support North's art. Okay? How about the Garden of Eden? Well, if the Garden of Eden really existed, well, we can also find it, and we've never been able to find it. All right? How about Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Again, no evidence that any of these individuals ever existed. How about Moses? Well, we would think if Moses really did exist, there will be some records of him in the Egyptian history. I mean, 10 plagues is a travesty and a disaster on the Egyptian people. No record of that. The parting of the sea, no record of that. The judges, Joshua, nothing. It is only until we get to David when we begin to see historical records and prove that David actually existed. But before that, nothing in the Bible has proven to be historical. And so this is very confusing. So what I will show you today is if you see the Bible as a historical record, you will only get confused. If you see this as chronology, this makes no sense. If you see this as a work of fiction, like a lot of people do, this doesn't make much sense either. because maybe the Bible, these events aren't actually interconnected with each other. David has no memory of Moses, for example. That's weird. Moses has no memory of Abraham. So these stories are not interconnected. So if this is not a historical record, if this is not a work of pure fiction, what is this thing? What I will show you today is this This is not a chronology. This is a cosmology. Cosmology. Okay? Remember, last class we talked about why things are written down in the ancient past. And as I said, King sponsored writing projects for three major reasons. The first reason is to create legitimacy and authority. The second reason is to create a national identity, cohesion among the people. The third reason is the idea of differentiation. To tell people who they are not. We're Israelites, we're not Egyptians. We're not Canaanites. We're not Philistines. Okay, so these are the three major reasons why kings sponsor writing projects. And for the Israelites and David, these three imperatives are particular salesmen. They're really necessary. So let me explain why that's the case. So legitimacy. Remember, David usurped the throne from Saul. Saul came from a noble family and he was elected by the Chieftains to be their king. And then David launched a rebellion and eventually usurped the throne. So David has a major legitimacy problem. legitimacy problem. So how he solves the problem as we discussed last class is the Bible presents him as a poet king. This is a very important concept, poet king. There have been warrior kings, kings who go to war and they win legitimacy by defeating all their enemies. There have been priest kings, kings who are head of a major religion, but David is the first Poet king. Okay, he writes poetry. He sings songs. He's a sense of the soul. That's what explains his affair with Rasheba. And that tells us he could never have possibly been ambitious and wanted to kill Saul. Okay, he's the first poet king. So why is he king of Israel? Because guess what guys? God is the poet God. Okay? Poet God. Yahweh is the poet God. So this is a radical conception of divinity in the ancient world. Gods previously have been priests or warriors, and this is the first time in human history where God Yahweh has been presented as a poet God. When you read the Bible, it's very interesting how he creates the world. He speaks and things are created. He says, let there be light. Let there be heaven and earth. He speaks and when he speaks a new world is created. And then he looked at this world and says, and this is good. Okay? So he's like a writer who speaks words and then who edits his words in order to create something much more beautiful. He's a poet. And as a poet, he's very sensitive. Okay? Which means he creates alimony because he's lonely. He wants friendship. Okay? So, in other words, the Bible is fundamentally a story of friendship, of two poets who are alone in the world who found friendship and comfort in each other. And the way the Bible accomplishes is through the idea of covenant. So, in the Bible, there are four covenants, promises. So the first covenant is between Noah and Yahweh. It's what we call the Noah had covenant, the Noah had covenant. The idea of this is this, after Yahweh destroys the world, he feels tremendous remorse for what he's done. He promises Noah, as long as humans are not too evil, I will not destroy the world. If humans stay good, I will not destroy the world. The second covenant is between Abraham and Yahweh. It's called the Abrahamic covenant. And in this covenant, Yahweh says to Abraham, if you and your ancestors, sorry, if you and your descendants stay true to me, I will create a great nation out of you. I will give you the nation of Israel. Now the third covenant is between Moses and Yahweh. It's called the Mosaic covenant. And the idea is if the actualites follow the tank amendments and worship Yahweh only Yahweh, then Yahweh will protect them as a nation. Yahweh will show them favor. So those are the three covenants. But when we look at the Davidic covenant, something interesting happens. All three priestly are what we call conditional covenants. If you do this, then I will do this. But when we get to David, it's unconditional. Ayahuay will promise that you, David, and your descendants will forever rule Israel. The House of David will forever rule Israel. It's an unconditional covenant that shows his everlasting friendship with David. In other words, the Divinity Covenant marks the end of biblical history. Yahweh, this great god, poet god who's been, who searched the universe for friendship, has now found his great friend in David. And so his search has ended and biblical history has ended. Okay? So this is a radical new idea in human history, how a king and a god can be poets and and how the world, how reality can be constructed through words. Okay? And that's why in the Bible, there's a very famous phrase called, in the beginning, there was the word. And that's why Jewish people are so literary, okay? Because that's part of the tradition. If you look at some of the most famous writers, some of the most famous thinkers in the world, they're mainly Jewish. And again, a lot of it is because the Jewish faith is the first faith to focus on literary creation. So that's the idea of legitimacy, cohesion. So, cohesion, okay? The second purpose is great cohesion. And as we discussed, after the Bronze Age collapsed, the land of Canine was in complete chaos. You had all these different groups within Canine. You had the nomads from the desert, okay? The Bedouins. You had the hill people of Canine. You have refugees from the cities of Canaan, and these cities have been destroyed. You have Egyptian priests. You have foreign mercenaries. And now you have sea peoples, these Greeks and these other peoples who are coming into Canaan because they've lost their lands back at home. So you've got this very different group of people together. They're in competition with other groups, like the Philistines. So now they need to create a national identity out of all this, right? And that's what the Bible is doing, guys. Okay? Remember, there's a concept we learned that's very important in class called secretization, right? Secretization. When you bring different religions together and create a new religion. So for example, let's say my God is Zeus and your God is Hera. And I conquer you, and I make you part of my people. So what we do in this instance is we marry our gods to each other. So now Zeus is married to Hera, and they have children like Aphrodite and Athena. And this is a way to soothe the process of conquest. Because even though I conquered you, I still have to live with you. So we have to blend in our different cultures. This is also true for the idea of genealogy, family history. Every tribe has a patriarch. And the reason we have a patriarch is to tell the people we've been in this land for the longest time. And that's why we have legitimacy and control over this land because we were here first. Now, when tribes get together, they intermarry, they form alliances, what they do that's very common is their ancestors merged together. They become sons and fathers of each other. So as though it's like one family history. You take these different family histories and you merge them into one line, the same process of synchronization. So if you look at this instance, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, it's basically three major tribes of Israel coming together to form one family history. In this instance, the most powerful family is that of Jacob. Because Jacob, Israel, gives his name to the new nation of Israel. The second most important person or tribe is Abraham, because he's the progenitor of this family, okay? And third will be Isaac. And in fact, in the Bible, Isaac receives the least amount of attention, okay? But the signolization process also helps us explain Moses. Because we've been looking for 100 years, and we have not found any evidence that Moses ever existed. Or anyone like Moses existed in Egypt. So what's Moses doing? Well, what Moses is doing is explaining why there are Egyptian priests in the nation of Israel, right? And why are priests important? Because if you're David and you're now king, you want to create legitimacy and you want to create authority. And the best way you create authority is by centralizing your power. Back then, the best and easiest way to centralize power is by centralizing religious ritual. That's not make sense. So what he did was this. He created, he made this new capital, Jerusalem, and he built something called the temple of Jerusalem, which became the house of Yahweh. This is where Yahweh lived. So if you wanted to worship Yahweh, and you had to, because he was your God, you had to come all the way to Jerusalem to offer a sacrifice. And who controlled the sacrifice process? Priests, okay? And why did the priests, why did the priests, Egyptian priests, why are they controlling the secularist process? Because they're the ones, Moses, who led the people of Israel out of Egypt. The ones who delivered the Israelites into freedom. Moses is an Egyptian name. It means son of. So it's a very common Egyptian name. So for example, Ramses means son of Ra. So Ramses is a very famous Egyptian pharaoh. Ramses means son of Ra, the sun god. So both Moses and his brother Aaron, these are Egyptian names for Egyptian priests. So David was heavily reliant on these Egyptian priests in order to centralize authority. Also, the idea of circumcision, it is an ancient Egyptian practice that priests specialized in. So if the new law is to be a member of Israel, to be an Israelite, means you have to get circumcised, you have to circumcise your children, you're going to go to the Egyptian priest to circumcise your children because they're good at that and they know how to do that. Does that make sense? So by making circumcision the major mark of what it means to be an Israelite, it gives authority and power to these Egyptian priests. Does that make sense? Okay? The judges, what we believe is that judges are these local heroes that bring in all the other tribes of Israel together. Okay? So in other words, if you are a member of this new nation of Israel, you have an entirety or an ancestor within the cosmology of the Bible. Okay? And this explains why the history of Israel is so convoluted, contradictory, and complex. Because it's trying to create a national identity where everyone, all tribes, all everyone is able to contribute effectively to the creation of the nation of Israel. Okay? Any questions before I continue? Is this clear to you guys? What's going on? Any other questions? All right, now the last question is differentiation. And this is the most important, because remember, you have Egyptian priests in Israel. How do we know they're loyal to Israel and not to Egypt? Because the Egyptian priests went to war with the Pharaoh. We have Canaanites within the state of Israel. How do we know they're loyal? Because they went to war with the Canaanites. So in the Bible, what's interesting to me with the Bible is, the Israelites in their history went to war with everyone. Okay? The Egyptians, the Philistines, the Canaanites went to war with everyone. Why? Because they had members from every single geography and location in that area. And so they needed to differentiate themselves. The best way to differentiate yourself is by going to war with them. Does that make sense? Also, guys, when you use the word nation, I have to warn you, this is not the modern sense. Nation, it's a loose political affiliation that is fluid. Today, the nation stayed. Your Chinese is stuck being Chinese. But back then, if you're an issue light, guess what? You could walk across the street and become a Moabite. So the idea of identity back then was extremely loose and fluid. So when we use a term, mold, but arcane light, basically we're talking about a geographical location that has some political force. But it's not a fixed identity. The very idea of ethnicity, race, group identity, back then it was extremely fluid. It was basically non-existent. So Israel, the very idea of Israel, it's a literary creation. The idea of Israelite, it is a political creation. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions so far? If I move on. Are you clear? Okay, all right. All right, so this explains why the Bible is structured the way it is. But then the question then is, and this is a very important question, is, okay, you know what, this was standard cultural practice back then. Everyone did this to create identity. So why is it we have the Bible today and not say other texts from Egypt or Mesopotamia? Why is it that the Bible was able to conquer the world basically? Because you have two billion Christians, you have a billion Muslims, the Bible was able to conquer the world and capture the imagination of humanity. And here I want to explain why the Bible is so powerful. It was how it was written that made it so powerful. So last class we talked about the apology of David about the Bersieper story, about the Abner story. And we believe the person who wrote those stories are what we call the court historian. We have absolutely no idea who he is. He's basically the official historian of the court of David, okay? And every court will have an official historian. And those stories are good, but they're not literary, okay? They're just propaganda and spin. But the person who wrote the Bible, especially Genesis, was a unique literary genius of the statue of Homer and Plato and Dante, okay? The person who wrote the Bible, who first wrote the Bible, was an incredible literary genius. And we call her the Yahwehs. Okay, why do we call her the Yahwehs? It's just convention because she uses Yahweh as the name of God, and other writers don't actually use Yahweh as the name of God, okay? So by convention we call her the Yahwehs. Another question then is who is she? And we're fairly certain she's a, it's a she, okay? And as I will show you, we're fairly certain it's a she because she focuses not on war, not on conflict, but on domestic tragedy and affairs. Childbirth, marriage, love. And this is unique in human history. So we're fairly confident it's a she. There are many who believe she is of the court of David. of David. The reason why is, first of all, what she writes is very favorable to the court of David. Also, back then, as you can imagine, only aristocratic women have the privilege of reading and writing. She clearly had access to the mythology of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Atolia. she has access to a great education. So we believe she's a princess. I will further make the argument that she must be either daughter or the granddaughter of King David. Okay? I would make this argument that she has to be the daughter or the granddaughter of King David. And the reason why is what she wrote, and I'll show you what she wrote, what she wrote was so controversial and so unique and so imaginative that the priesthood could not possibly accept what she did. If she was just a priest or if she was just in the aristocratic of Moe Berth, there was no way her writings would become part of the Bible. So she must have been someone of high authority. And there is actually a precedent for this. So for example, we know that in about 2000 BC, this is at least a thousand years before the Yahweh began to write, the Sgt. of Agh-Khad, who is the first great empire builder, the first emperor, basically. And this is someone that back then, during the time of King David, everyone knew and worshipped. King David knew about him, and he knew about his practices. When Sirgum Aghkhad conquered Mesopotamia, he appointed his daughter named Enh-Heh Duana to be like the high priestess of their religion. But what's interesting about her is she's a poet and she is the first name author in human history. Okay, this is 2000 BC. She wrote a lot of poetry. So there is a history, a president, for these kings to point their daughters to be the official poet of their nation. So that's what I think the Yahweh is. But honestly, we'll never know and it's not important. We have to know she was an exceptional literary genius who made the Bible what it is today. So let's go over some of her literary contributions very shortly. And again, because the Bible has been redacted for about 3,000 years, 3,000 years, we've lost a lot of her original writings. So I will analyze a couple of stories that we know for sure she wrote. The first is called Adam and Eve. The second is the story of Jacob and Rachel. All right. So you think you know the story of Adam and Eve, but I guarantee you it's wrong. Okay. I guarantee you even you know the story of Adam and Eve, it's wrong. All right. So let's go over the official or the mainstream understanding of the story of Adam and Eve. God told Adam and Eve, listen, this is a God in Eden. It's paradise. You can do whatever you want. You live, life is easy, apples fall from the sky, okay? You can pick tomatoes and carrots from the ground. Life is easy, it's paradise for you. But there's one rule and only one rule in the God I'm eating. And the rule is, do not eat from the tree of not of good and evil. Because it's poisonous. And of course, Adam and Eve had to disobey God. And God became so angry that he banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. And now see our act of disobedience, the first act of disobedience, our first sin. The original sin that has doomed us forever until the redemption of Jesus, right? That's a story we all know. The story is completed and under the wall. That's not what it says in the Bible. So I'll explain first what the Bible says, and then I'll explain how we can interpret the story. Okay, so God says to Adam and Eve, don't eat that food, okay? And then Adam and Eve are curious, why can't you eat that food? And then Eve meets a serpent on the ground and Eve's in the serpent talk. And Eve basically says, we can't eat that fruit. And the serpent says, why? Eve says, it's poisonous. So the serpent says, no, it's not poisonous. You're being lied to. The reason why Yahweh does not want you to eat from the fruit is once you eat it, you'll become like God. Your eyes will open. You have the notch of good and evil. And then Eve gets angry because she feels manipulated. and she convinces Adam to eat the fruit as well. So they eat the fruit and their eyes are open now. They have not a good and evil. Yahweh visits them in the garden and he discovers they're hiding from him. And Yahweh commands them to come out and he sees right away they're embarrassed about their nakedness. They're embarrassed about being confronted by Yahweh. So Yahweh knows they've eaten the fruit. Adam says to Yahweh, it's Eve's fault. Eve says to Yahweh, it's the serpent's fault. And Yahweh decides to punish all three. He says to the serpent, from now on, you will slither on the ground, and you'll be hunted by men. Eve, from now on, you and all your descendants will suffer the pains of childbirth. Childbirth will be an extremely painful process. And then he says to Adam, From now on, you must sweat to grow food, to feed yourself. From now on, life will be hardship. It will be a, it will be toil and pain and suffering. Okay? And then he does this, okay? This is very interesting. And this is where the Bible demonstrates its genius, okay? And the Lord God made garments of skins for the man and his wife and clothed them. Then the Lord said, see, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. And now he might reach out his hand and take also the tree of life and live forever. Okay? This is where the Bible is genius. Because it's telling us why God is banishing Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. It's telling us. It's because there's another tree God didn't mention to them. It's called the tree of life. and it allows you to live forever. So why is this a problem? Well, there are two things that differentiate God from us humans. The first thing is God has knowledge of good and evil. Second thing is God lives forever. That's it, okay? That's the only difference. So if Adam and Eve now know good and evil, if they eat from the tree of life, they can live forever. So God's afraid will become like God. Therefore, to protect the tree of life, he has to banish us from the garden. OK? Yeah? Excuse me? Yeah, exactly. OK. What is good and evil? OK. So this is what the so this is a really complicated idea. OK? But good and evil does not mean you know God, you know Satan. That's not what it means. It means you know what's good for you, what's bad for you. So for example, before I knew good and evil, I hit this table, okay? I feel pain, right? And I'm like, what pain? What is that? Is that good or is that bad? I don't know. So I do it again, okay? And I do it again. I cannot learn from my mistakes because I cannot differentiate what's good for me and what's bad for me. But now I know good and evil. I'm like, oh, I hit this thing. It's I feel pain. Therefore it's evil. Therefore I shouldn't do it again. Therefore I should avoid this table. So knowing good and evil means you have the capacity to learn and to grow through a process of self-reflection. Once you have judgment, once you're able to differentiate what's good for you and what's bad for you, you can always grow as a person. Does that make sense? And if you can do this forever, that you have life and live forever, it means you become God, because your knowledge is now infinite. Okay? Doesn't make sense. That's what knowledge of good and evil is. The ability to differentiate for yourself what is good for you and what is bad for you. To engage in a process of reflection and self-growth. Okay? So God's afraid that if we continue to grow we will become as powerful as God himself. Any more questions before I continue? The key line is this. And the Lord God made garments of skins for the man's wife and clothed them. This is right after he punishes Adam and Eve. This is right after he scolds them. Right? This is God giving, pitting them and giving them a present. This is very strange. This is paradoxical. What would God do this? OK, there are different ways to interpret this. But I think this is God showing remorse and regret. Okay? This is a radical idea. But this is God saying to Adam and Eve, I'm sorry for this. This is God showing remorse and regret. Why is God showing remorse and regret? You show remorse and regret, and you just think wrong, right? But what did God do wrong? What did God do wrong? Why is God in the wrong here? It's a radical idea. But can you figure it out? Okay, God lied to Adam and Eve. God said to Adam and Eve, do not eat from this tree because it's poisonous. Right? So imagine this. Imagine you're my two daughters, okay? And you're like six or seven years old. And you see me at night drinking whiskey or beer. I'm really happy because I'm drinking whiskey and beer. So you two are curious and you say to me, Dad, what is this? And I say it's poison. And then you're like, why are you drinking poison, dad? Like, well, because I'm older than you are. When you're as old as I am, you can drink this poison. OK? You two are now curious. Right? You're curious. Why is dad drinking poison? So your uncle comes to the house one day and you ask your uncle, hey, is alcohol poisonous? Your uncle's like, of course it's not poisonous. What are you talking about? And so of course what you two do is you break into the alcohol cabinet, right? And you drink whiskey and you're very happy and you throw up. I comb home and I shut up you. You guys are terrible. I told you not to drink that. Go to your room and you're suspended for a month, okay? You go to your room and you cry. And then I come knocking and say, Hey, do you guys want to go out to McDonald's and have a hamburger together? You understand the story? Because I know I'm not wrong. I should not have said to you, alcohol is poisonous. I'm your bad parent. So what we mark about the story is, it's basically a domestic comedy. You understand? This is what happens among families all the time. This is a power of the story of Adam and Eve. It's a domestic comedy. It's something we can all relate to. It's something we can all understand. What's also really powerful about the story is, God is fallible. God has made a terrible mistake. What's important is this. God understands he's made a mistake. That's why he's showing remorse and regret. So again, Yahweh, he's a poet God. He's curious about the world. He wants to have friends. But he's inexperienced. He's naive. He's a new father. So he's going to make mistakes. Making mistakes is the process of growing up. What makes humans exceptional, what makes humans unique from animals is our capacity to make mistakes and to learn from them because we ate from the knowledge of, from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. OK? Do you see how radical all of this is? These are radical new ideas in human history. God is fallible. What's important is to understand and admit your mistakes and grow from them. The story continues because now Adam and Eve are banished from the Garden of Eden. They have two sons named Cain and Abel. Abel is a shepherd. Cain is a farmer. They both love God. They both want the respect and the attention of God. So they present, they give presence to God. Abel is a shepherd, so he offers mutton to God. And then Cain is a farmer, so he offers, I don't know, like wheat or vegetables to God. God tastes both. And then God's like, this mutton, it's tasty, awesome. Thank you, Abel. And then he eats Cain's offering and Cain's very anxious. He's very excited. And then Cain's like, and Abel's like, sorry, sorry. And then God, Yahweh is like, this foot sucks, man. All right? And this is what it says in the Bible. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering, he had no regard. He hated Cain's present. He loved Abel's present. So Cain was very angry and his countenance fell. The Lord said to Cain, why are you angry? If you do well, will you not be accepted? Okay? So again, it's a domestic comedy. You're my girls, you're my daughters. You go to school and you work very hard on presenting a present to me, right? And I say to one of you, oh, this is an awesome present, thank you. And I say to the other, you suck, man. I'm not a bad parent. God is being a terrible parent, okay? If you do well, will you not be accepted? You suck, man. The problem isn't me, the problem is you. You just suck, okay? And of course, what happens next is, Cain kills Abel. But then what happens next is interesting, is Yahweh finds out about this and he banishes Cain. And then Cain says to God, hey, if you banish me, people will know I committed wrong, and therefore I will be killed by other people. Then Yahweh says to Cain, okay, I will put a mark on you, the mark of Cain. And if anyone touches you, then I will punish that person. I will protect you with the mark of Cain. And this again, God showing remorse and regret for what he's done. Because God knows in his heart, he's not wrong here. But what allow God to understand he committed wrong is because Cain argued with him. Cain argued back. So this is a radical conception of faith in the Hebrew Bible. Faith, love of God requires you to argue with God. Because it's only for the process of argument that God who's fallible will learn and grow. So when you argue, when you fight back, you're helping the other person grow. Okay, any questions about this story before I move on? As you can see, it's a powerful story that reveals so much about the idea of faith and justice and divinity. Any more questions before I move on? Okay, so again, the Yahweh is a literary genius. And there are two things that make her stand out, that make her unique in the history of literature. The first is her economy. Economy just means using as few words as possible to express as much as possible. You can see the story of Adam and Eve, the story of King and Abel, it's very economical. She's using very few words, but within these words are a universe of ideas, almost infinite meaning. You can interpret these stories any way you want. Okay? The second idea is irony. Irony just means she's funny. Okay? If you tell your kids, don't eat that apple, don't eat that fruit because it's poisonous, guess what? Your kids are gonna eat that fruit, okay? And then you're gonna look like an idiot because it's not poisonous. So it's ironic. She's making fun of Yahweh. She's making fun of the highest authority in the Ishmaelite faith. And again, that's why if she were not the daughter of David or a granddaughter daughter of David, There's no way this story would have gotten into the Bible, okay? But it's a great story that has infinite literary power. Does that make sense? The last story I will mention is a story of Rachel and Jacob. It's a very short story, okay? So what happens is this? Jacob runs away from his brother, Esau, because Jacob stole Esau's birthright and blessing. And Jacob ends up with a relative named Laban. And Laban has two daughters, Leah and Rachel. Leah is the eldest. Rachel is the younger one. And Jacob falls in love with Rachel right away. And he says to Laban, I will work for you for three, four, seven years, and then I will want your daughter, Rachel's, hand in return for my work. And Laban says, well, you're a relative, And it's better for me to give her to you than to complete stranger. So yeah, okay. Seven years pass and there's a wedding between Rachel and Jacob. That night Jacob has sex with a woman. He wakes up and sees it's not Rachel, it's Leah. He slept with Leah. He is now married to Leah. Then Jacob says to Laban, you tricked me. And then LeBron says, it is the custom of our people to marry the first one first. We have to marry Leah first before we can marry off Rachel. If you continue to work for me for seven years, I will give you Rachel as well, and Jake McGree's. Okay? So it's a very short story. And there's a lot of economy and irony in this story. But again, within the short story, there is a universe of ideas and emotions. If you're able to think very clearly and closely of the story, we will discover that, A, Rachel and Leah hate each other. How do we know that? Because Leah stole Jacob from Rachel. We can imagine that when Laban announced that Rachel would marry Jacob, Leah was very jealous. And for seven years, every night at dinner, Leah would cry and scream at her father. How could you embarrass me like this? I'm your first born. Do I mean nothing to you? We can imagine the family drama and the comedy, right? Laban's like, you know what? After seven years, Jacob, Mary, Rachel, they're going to run off together, right? And for the rest of my life, I'm stuck with Leah screaming at me and hitting me in the head for the rest of my life, right? So he's like, I need to figure out how to get out of this deal, right? So that's why he tricks Jacob. We can also figure out that Rachel and Jacob love each other. love is the greatest love in the world. Because, first of all, Jacob's willing to put up this crap for another seven years in order to be of Rachel, right? Second of all, Rachel's willing to wait for Jacob. She could at any time just run off and be with someone else, but she's willing to endure. She's willing to suffer. So we can imagine the entire family dynamic in history Based on, there's a few sentences in the Bible. That's the power of the Yahwehs. The Yahwehs, she's really writing about what it means to be human. What it means to have a family. And that's why the Bible endures to this day. Because there are these powerful stories in the Bible that tell us, that reveal to us what it means to be human. What it means to love. What it means to forgive. What it means to have family. And that's why the Bible has inspired people for thousands of years. Because in these stories, you are part of the writing process. It's co-creation. Your meaning, co-creation, your meaning, your understanding, interpretation is what gives life to these words. There are not many words, but your understanding of these words is what makes these words powerful to you. And again, these stories are unique in human history. The story of Adam and Eve is everyone knows the story of Adam and Eve, okay? Because it's just a powerful story. You can also argue the power of Adam and Eve is because it makes us nostalgic for the Ice Age, right? Remember the Ice Age, we were in the Gallitarian society where everyone was equal. And the Garden of Eden is a metaphor, a symbol for that time. Okay? So it is provoking or activating our nostalgia for that time. Within each of us must be that a long lost memory of a time when we humans were alone in the world. There weren't that many of us. But life was fairly pleasant. Okay? Food was plentiful. We were all friends with each other. We didn't really struggle against each other. We really didn't struggle against nature We were one with nature and with each other Yeah, any any questions? Yeah, who do the Christians believe to have written in the Bible? Well God, right? This is the exact these are the words of God and so in the Bible there are people called prophets prophets and And how prophets work is they visit heaven, or they visit by an angel. And there's one scene where the angel or God takes a parchment and puts it into the mouth of the prophet. So the prophet is speaking every word. That's a direct word of God. Does that make sense? Like, it's almost like he's just a male man. I'm God. I put a parchment in your mouth. You come back to earth and you basically announce the word of God. So there are people who believe God wrote every word. But this is only my note of Christians. Most Christians believe that whoever wrote the Bible was inspired by God. That these are prophets who were inspired by God to write down the truths of God. But if you actually try to read the Bible by yourself, it's impossible because it's been redacted so many times. As I explained to you last class, there are at least four different sources in the Bible that have been spliced together randomly. And it's been edited constantly over the centuries. But honestly, no one reads the Bible in its entirety. What usually happens is people only read sections of the Bible. Most people get understanding from the Bible from preachers. And preachers will explain to you what these stories mean, but you won't actually have to read them together. Does that make sense? So what I'm offering you today is not a scriptural interpretation of the Bible. I'm offering you what we call a literary interpretation of the Bible. Any more questions? Are you guys clear about this? Okay, so we'll continue this Bible next class. And next class we will look at the religion of Zoroastrianism. Because when the Persian Empire conquests the world, Zoroastrianism, their religion, will start to merge with the Bible, which creates new ideas that will eventually become the basis of Christianity. Okay?"}

So I want to make the UD the argument that a conflict is very likely. And so we'll be discussing why it's likely, how this war will benefits itself and what will happen after this war, okay? So the first thing to know about America is that it is a country that enjoys violence. You can say that Americans are addicted to violence. So for example, America has 434 million guns. That's 1.3 guns for every one person. And the guns they have, a lot of them are like semi machine guns. So it's a very gun obsessed society. Not only that, but they believe that gun ownership is their sacred right as Americans. So the second amendment of the Constitution is that every American has a right to bear arms. Then there's American football. Have you guys seen American football? Where guys just bang at each other, okay? It is extremely violent sport. In fact, America is really the only country that places sport. And Americans love football. The Super Bowl is the most watched TV event every year. And the game of football causes a lot of psychological injuries. Okay, so there are a lot of football players who at age 30, they either commit suicide or they will kill someone because their brains have been destroyed by the game. Okay, it is extremely violent sport and even though it is barbaric, Americans love it. Americans also worship their history of wars. Okay, they believe that fighting war, It's noble and it's sacred. So second thing to know about America is that it has a long history of fighting wars. In fact, you can make the argument that America has been continuously at war since its founding in 1776, even before that. So the first major war that America fought, of course, was the Revolution. 1776, war of independence. And the reality is that Americans believed this war was sacred. And it was a revolution in human affairs. But if you actually look at the history of this war, you'll discover that the Americans didn't really fight this war for a good reason. They fought this war because the British were taxing them. But if you think about it, well, the British were providing defense. They were providing army, right? So the British had a very good reason to attacks the Americans. But the Americans didn't really like this, so they rebelled. And the rebellion was actually the first American Civil War, because there were actually a lot of Americans who wanted to remain in the Union. And so these loyalists, a lot of them were terrorized by extremists who wanted independence. So that is the American Revolution. But after the American Revolution, the Americans embarked on something called manifest destiny. And the idea of manifest destiny is that it is God's will that America controls all of the Americas, North America and South America. So the Americans embarked on a violent colonization of all lands, killing many natives and other peoples to control America, manifest destiny. And then this led to, from 1861 to 1865, the American Civil War, which killed 800,000, a million Americans. but it was the deadliest war that America ever fought, okay? Much more so than World War II and World War I. In fact, more people died in this war than in World War I and World War II combined for America. And we looked at the reason for the Civil War. Again, you're like, they didn't actually have to fight this war, okay? So, at the founding of the nation, America was divided into North and South. And the difference is that the North was very industrial. And the South was agricultural, okay? And because the economies were different, the way they showed their politics and society were different. So the North believed in free labor, meaning that you were free to do any job you want, and employers were free to hire anyone they wanted. And this system is obviously much more efficient, because it's a much better use of manpower. And so this caused the North to prosper and become very wealthy and expanded, okay? So at the start of the Civil War in 1861, the North had a population of 22 million people, okay? very wealthy, very powerful. The self was an agricultural base economy, and therefore it had to rely on slave labor. And even though slave labor made wealthy people very prosperous, it was not good for the economy as a whole, okay? It was an inefficient use of manpower. And at the start of the war, they only had about nine million people. But what's important to remember is that the North was an industrial-based economy. The South was an agricultural-based economy. So in terms of weapons manufacturing, in terms of logistics, in terms of organization, the North had a huge advantage over the South. Now, why did they fight the war? And the center explanation is because the North wanted to get rid of the evil of slavery. And that's not true, that's not what happened. So at the beginning of the founding of the nation, the Constitution permitted slavery. Slavery was legal. And so the South were free to have as many slaves as they want. The North didn't need slaves because it was industrial-based economy. The problem was the nation was expanding Westwoods, okay? The nation was expanding West and they were adding more states into the union and the more states there are they can send senators and representatives to Washington DC, okay? And the fear was that if these Western states were were pro-slavery, then that would tip the balance in favor of the pro-slavery cap. But if the reverse were true, if the western states were anti-slavery, then the south would be marginalized. So for decades, there's this fierce debate as to how to handle these western states, these Western states as they were emitted into the union one by one. Okay? And the solution, what they call the Missouri compromise is that for every one state that came in as pro-slavery, the other state, the next state had to be anti-slavery. Okay? Does that make sense? To maintain a balance. The problem of course is that a lot of these Western states had their own opinions. So the western, so some of these western states for example Kansas would would want to be anti-slavery. Okay. So for decades this was a huge issue politically in America which divided the nation. The turning point was in 1860 when Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States and Lincoln was radically anti-slavery. He believed that slavery was evil and had to be abolished at some point. The rest of the world abolished slavery. Why is it in America there are so many slaves? So that was Lincoln's agenda. But Lincoln was also a lawyer and he believed that the self legally had a right to slavery. slavery. But over time what we can do is limit slavery in the West and therefore over time it may be 100 years time, slavery would naturally cease to exist. Okay? That was Lincoln's plan. Now Assol did not like this plan and they were afraid of what Lincoln might really do as president. So they declared independence from the United States. They basically succeeded from the union. And Lincoln's response invaded the South. So basically, the Civil War was a battle over how much power the federal government had. So from the perspective of the South, they were fighting the war for their right to freely express their political views. Okay? And the North was fighting to maintain the union. Slavery was not the main issue. In fact, Lincoln himself said that if I could end the war without freeing these slaves, I would do so. Slavery is not the main issue. keeping the union intact was the main issue. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay, so, but again, they could have chosen to politically compromise. They could have had discussions, right? They could have even broke apart, but they chose to fight a gruesome civil war, okay? So the third thing you need to know about America is that America resolves conflicts for violence. It doesn't really have a history of diplomacy. It has the history of war-making. That's how America usually resolves issues. So, given this history, now let's look at the conflicts in America today to see how serious the division is. And the reality is that today it's actually very, very serious. Far more so than in 1861 when they fought the first of award. So let's look at the divisions. The first major division is basically between the halves and half-nots, so inequality and debt. So the wealth fee, the top 1%, not only do they control most of the wealth in America, But they also control what we call the means of production, meaning that if new money comes into the system, they will seize it. So basically, the top 1% have a monopoly over wealth production. And the way they make most of their money is actually through collecting debt, like exploiting other people. And this is what we call a rentier economy. Now what exaggerates makes the situation worse are the cultural wars. So America is divided between left and right. And this division actually goes back to the very founding of America in the 1600s. So in America, in its founding, there were two opposing visions or strands. The first strand are people who came to America to build a kingdom of God, a Christian nation that follows the laws of God. These are the pilgrims and the paratens, and we've discussed them before. And they've always been there. And they today comprise the right. And the right are people who believe in conservative Christian values. The left. But there's also another strand of America and these are dissidents or political dissidents and they believe in the enlightenment. They believe that reason should be the God of human affairs. And these were the founding fathers. The founding fathers believed in something called deism, which is that There is a God, but God gave us a power, reason, and logic to determine our own affairs. So the Constitution is a document based on deism, separation of church and state. And they want to create a multicultural secular empire. empire, okay, and today it manifests itself in the left, okay. Now, there's actually a lot of crossover between the left and the wealthier, okay, because if you look at the left, it's usually urban, liberal, and college educated, okay, and And these are the people usually with all the money. So the inequality only makes the culture worse, much worse. And so the right feel left out. Another major division in America that's important is the one between empire and democracy. meaning that there are many people in America who benefit from America being an empire, but the rest suffer from the fact that America is an empire, okay? So for example, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq made Wall Street very rich, right? But it was the poor, the right, who sent their sons to fight in these wars who lost their lives or lost a limb. It was the poor who were taxed in order to fund these wars. And it's the poor who must pay off the debt from these wars. So the right is also very isolationist, meaning they don't want to fight these wars. They think that America should be an island. It should not intervene in the affairs of the world. Okay? So there are a lot of divisions in America. The problem today is that there's no actual solution to any of these divisions. And the reason why, there are three major reasons why a civil war would probably break out. The first major reason is the over-militization of America. And so what this means is that, okay, first of all, we've already said that in America, there are 434 million guns in private hands. So every individual has access to one or two guns. That's the first problem. That's the first problem. Second problem is that if you go to a small town in America and you look at the police there, you think that, OK, it's a small town. It's safe. They should have, I don't know, pistols, right? In fact, they have armored vehicles. Sometimes they have tanks. They have helicopters. They have bulletproof vests. They have machine guns. They got all this from the military. So that's just like a local police force. I'm not even talking about the state militias, the National Guard. These guys are basically an army onto themselves. Then you have federal agencies like the FBI and the CIA and Homeland Security, NSA. There's dozens of these federal agencies. They themselves are their own army, meaning that the FBI and the CIA all have their special forces, tanks, helicopters, jets, bombs, missiles, okay? So these guys can go to war against each other, okay? Then you have the US military. The US military is divided into the army, the air force, the Marines, the Navy, OK? And then have some space force, OK? All right. To show you how powerful the US military is, OK? Let's look at the top five air forces in the world, OK? The top five institutions or countries with the most powerful air force in the world. Who's number one? Who's number one, do you think? US Air Force, right? Who's number two, do you guys know? The top five air forces in the world. Number one will be the US Air Force, right? Who's number two, do you think? Yes, who's number two? Yeah, okay, Russian, actually number three, okay? The Russian Air Force will be number three. Who's number two, though? Hmm? The UK, the British, right? Nope, okay. Number two is actually the US Navy. Number three is Russia. Number four is who? Can you guys guess? The US Army. And who's number five? Can you guys guess? It's the US Marines. Okay? So four of the top five air forces in the world are an arm of the US military. Okay, number one is the US Air Force. Number two is the US Navy. Number three is Russia. the entire country of retro, okay? Number four is the US Army. Number five is the US Marines. That's how powerful America is. But then you have special forces. And again, we've discussed special forces in this class before. And we said that special forces are good for special circumstances, like for example, hijackings, okay? or covert operations. The problem with special forces is they cannot be controlled. So for example, in Mexico, the people who run the drug cartels are former special forces. Do you understand? The people who run the drug cartels in Mexico and who commit the most violence in the world are former members of their special forces. That's why you want to limit your special forces. So in the year 2000, America had 38,000 special forces. Today it has 72,000 or 73,000, I can't remember, okay? That's a lot of special forces. These guys are trained in demolition, destroying buildings. They're an army onto themselves, okay? It would take exactly a thousand of these guys, exactly a thousand of these guys to overthrow the US government, okay? And guess what? Delta Force, which is the most elite special force unit in America, has exactly 1,000 members. So you have this guy who runs the Delta Force, seems like I wanna over for the US government for whatever reason, he can do so because they're so powerful, okay? So I think special forces, it's just a bomb waiting to explode. So the first major issue is this, the overmilitarization of America where anyone who has access to weapons can choose to start a war, okay? That's the first problem. Second problem is the breakdown of narratives. Okay, so a nation is a fiction, a narrative that everyone believes in. And there are certain narratives that have kept America united. So for example, the first narrative is the American dream, the quality of opportunity. So that as long as you work hard and you play by the rules, you will succeed in America. That's the American dream. Guess what guys? No one believes in this anymore, okay? And the reason why is the inequality in America, as well as the cultural wars. So a very young person, you don't believe that if you work hard, you own a house and you will be wealthy. You don't believe that, okay? You think like the game is stacked against you. You believe that Washington is corrupt, it only serves the interests of a rich. You believe that the wealthy have stowed everything. They monopolize wealth. And you believe that whatever money you make will be stolen by the rich and by the government. So there's absolutely no reason to work hard. So this idea that if you work hard, you will succeed. It's dead. Now the new American dream is, how do I stay out of debt? If you are a college graduate, you have tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Consumers have thousands of dollars in credit card debt. You can no longer afford houses. If you buy a house, you can't pay off the markets. Okay. So this idea of the American dream, it's basically dead for most people. Then you have the narrative that America is good. Okay. you believe that America represents democracy. It represents liberty. It defends freedom around the world. Guess what, guys? Most people in America don't believe this anymore. So, for example, on the left, people are taught that America is a nation founded on slavery, violence, and war. America is a force of destruction and evil. Okay? That's what people on the left are taught. People on the right believe that America is an imperilous power that goes around and destroys countries for no reason. Okay? So most people don't actually believe that America is a force for good anymore. All right? And then you look at what's happening in Israel, right? Well, more young people now believe that America is a force of evil in the world. The other narrative that's really important is that it's a narrative of liberalism. And the idea of liberalism is that even though we have differences, there are mechanisms for us to work out our differences. For example, the right to freedom of speech, okay? Freedom of speech. You can say whatever you want, okay? Then you, but what's important is to debate the opponent and come to a compromise based on logic, evidence and the facts, okay? So for the longest time, liberalism was what brought the left and the right together, okay? Liberalism tried to be in the middle, but now liberalism is dead. Okay, and the reason why is in 2016 Donald Trump became president of the United States and the liberals in America went crazy They could not believe that Donald Trump could be Elected so they came to believe that the problem was democracy itself The problem is that people could not be reasoned with. Therefore, liberalism makes no sense. If people are stupid, if people could not be reasoned with, why give them freedom of speech? Why let them debate? Why let them vote? Okay? So liberalism today is dead. So the stories that basically bind the country together no longer work. Okay, does that make sense? Then the third problem is breakdown of authority or institutions. What kept the country together was the fact that people believed that the elites in power knew what they were doing and they were, they cared about the well-being of the nation and of the people, okay? But recent events have shown this isn't true, okay? So for example, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, right? Well, why did America fight these wars? For no reason. Then you had the 2008 financial crisis, where the banks basically stole from the nation, stole from the poor and kept the money. And everyone was screwed, okay? Then you had COVID, right? COVID, where the government, the elite, locked down the entire nation. Kids could not go to school. The poor could not go to work and make a living. And there was absolutely no evidence that COVID was actually dangerous. Okay? Then the government made everyone take a experimental vaccine. And people were like, why are we doing this? So elite actions over the past 20 years have made people cynical of power. So that in today's world, there's actually, in today's America, there's no more trusted institution. Before you had government, you had media, like New York Times, Washington Post, you had science, you had military. Okay. And the government is like, they're just corrupt, right? Screw them. Congress is hated by everyone. Okay. The middle, the media is just speaks for the rich. They're always lying to us, right? New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, they're just liars. Okay. So no one trusts the media anymore. Then you have science and you can't, you can't trust science because of COVID, right? Science made everyone take an experimental vaccine for no reason. So you can't trust science anymore. The military goes fights wars for no reason. Look at Ukraine. Look at Israel. Okay? So in other words, there's no institution in America that can bring people together anymore. They're not trusted. Oh, and also, I forgot about universities. Before people were searching for universities, but not anymore because of the cultural wars, right? So that's the problem in America right now. You have three things going on. You have the militarization of society where anyone can sort of war for no reason, okay? Second is that you have a breakdown of the stories and narratives that bind the country together. So no one knows what it means to be American anymore. And number three is there are no more authority figures, no more institutions that can bring people together. They're going to divide people. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? And this is getting worse. So we've seen the government fall, the media fall, the science fall, military fall, universities. But there's also the justice system, right? The courts. And this is falling as well because of Donald Trump. Remember that last week in New York City, Donald Trump was convicted guilty of 34 felonies. Okay? And so people are now no longer trusting the court system, the justice system. So again, all these sacred institutions in America, they're all falling one by one. So does this make sense? So if you look at all this, America's history of violence, the conflicts ranging in America, the fact that America no longer believes in institutions and in narratives, okay, then the most likely outcome is a civil war. Okay, does that make sense? So any questions so far? Yeah, so, Celine asked a very good question, like how powerful is the American president? The answer is that he's really a figurehead, okay? He's not that powerful, okay? as Celine points out, power is diffuse in America, in institutions. And if these institutions are corrupt, there's very little the president can do about it. And that's why this year, in November 2024, we will see the lowest turnout, one of the lowest turnout of voters in American history because people just give up, okay? Right? Four years ago, they came out to kick Trump out of office because they believe that Trump was a threat to democracy. And we're buying people recognize that, no, it's all corrupt. Just burn the system down. Who cares? So no one cares who's president anymore. And that's gonna help Trump in November. Any more questions before I move on? Okay, so Selina asked a question, what will the Civil War look like? That's a very good question. And the answer is it will look nothing like the first Civil War. Because in the first Civil War, there was clearly a division that the Biden nation, a pro-slavery camp and an anti-slavery camp. OK? But as you can see from this chart, in today's America, conflicts, there are many sorts of conflicts. There are many sorts of factions in America. And therefore, the Civil War will not be one event, but it will be a series of violent episodes over 10, 20, 50 years. Does that make sense? So let's go over these events. The first thing that would probably happen are riots and unrest. And we saw that during the first Trump presidency because of the George Floyd Black Lives Matter protests. So we'll see more of that when Trump becomes president, where people are so angry at this election, they'll start rioting. And there'll be a lot of unrest. Second is basically civil conflict, meaning that neighbors take guns against each other. So America is divided between left and right. But there are actually pockets of America where left and right are very closely, They live very closely with each other. So it's very likely that they take arms against each other. But these would be small, isolated affairs where maybe one or two people get killed. So you have civil conflict. Then you have state or city secession. Secession, sorry, I spoke as well. Secession. Meaning that you have maybe one city, New York City or one state, California, and they're so disgusted by the state of affairs, They declare independence, okay? They succeed. And guess what? They have their own army. Their citizens are armed, okay? But they'll most likely be attacked by other states or different groups, okay? So that would be a more major conflict, okay? Then you have what we'll call insurgencies. So basically a political group who's trying to form a government of some sort, okay? So it's possible that you have Christian extremists or maybe left-wing extremists who try to overflow the government of, I don't know, New York or Virginia. Then you have coup d'etats, where basically an arm of the military, maybe special forces, most probably special forces, tries to overflow the government. Okay? So I think in, because of the way things are structured in the next civil war, all these things will happen at once. Okay? And they'll build on top of each other. But remember that in America, it's a very large country. So there could be a lot of places where it's very peaceful. There's no war, okay? But there could also be some places like New York City in Los Angeles where there's just a lot of violence going on. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay, so whether or not the US government is overgrown, that's a very specific question I don't know. Okay? The only thing I can do is like, look at the structural forces and conclude that a civil war is very likely and that the civil war, it will be very chaotic. But what will actually happen in a civil war, I don't actually know, okay? But what I will say is that given the nature of the Civil War, I think that once the war ends, the outcome will be that America becomes a Christian isolationist theocracy. And the reason is very simple. The reason is very simple. Remember that at the founding of America, there were two opposing visions of the country. The first was to build a multicultural, secular empire to spread democracy and freedom around the world. That was the first vision. And America has achieved this vision. And it's led to all this conflict. The second vision, which is also very strong, is to believe in America as a white, Christian nation dedicated to the rule of God. Okay? And so I think there'll be extremists in America who will want to push this agenda. And why would they win? Why would they win? Why are they most likely to win this war? Okay, the answer is they're most willing to fight and to die for what they believe in. Okay? And guess what guys, a lot of these people happen to work in law enforcement, the military, and especially the special forces, okay? All right, doesn't make sense. So that's what I think will be the most likely outcome of the Civil War when it ends. But I don't know when it will end, okay? And I don't actually know what happens in between. The specifics, okay? All right? So any more questions before I finish? The last thing I want to talk about is the specifics of how the Civil War will start. What will ignite this war? Yeah, Peter? OK, so Peter asked a great question, which is universities in the past few decades have become more political-sized, meaning they're not actually interested in teaching you how to think. They're interested in teaching you how to think a certain way, which is very left-wing. So for example, the belief that America is a society based on violence and the enslavery and the exploitation of minorities, okay? So there's a lot of cool creptness in universities today. And Peter asked the question, okay, so what can we learn in university? And the answer is that even though universities have become more politicized, So your education in university is up to you, okay? Why? Because university is very big. There are a lot of professors, and there are a lot of different classes, okay? And so it's up to you to structure your own learning, and to be clear about what you want to learn, and to understand the limitations of the education you're getting, okay? Does that make sense? All right, any more questions before I move on? Okay, that's a great question, okay? So Jack asked a question like who are the ones who don't trust universities? And the answer of course, are people who are left out of the system, right? So people who don't actually go to the university. And people on the right basically, okay? People on the left are composed mainly of college educated individuals who are wealthy, okay? But at the same time, there are many universities who do not like what's going on. So there's a faction within the university, professors and students, who are dismayed by what's going on. But they're only a small fraction of the total population. Most universities have become extremely, extremely left-wing. Any more questions before I move on? OK, all right. So I'll move on to my next point, which will answer your question. Now let's talk about how the Civil War will actually start, okay? And it will start with the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump. And the reason why is that Trump is a unique figure in American politics. And the reason why is that he embodies the culture wars, okay? Meaning like the people on the left, all that they hate in the right, Manifest themselves in Donald Trump, okay? He's white, he's sexist, he's racist, he's a pig, and he doesn't apologize for any of this. He has no manners, he's not educated, he has no values. All the left hate in the right, manifest themselves in the body of Donald Trump. And that's why the right loves Donald Trump, right? Because their enemies hate them, okay? So, and for many in the right, Donald Trump is the Messiah, okay? He's the Jesus. And everything that's happened in the past eight, nine years for them has confirmed that Donald Trump is Jesus, okay? And the reason why is Donald Trump, ever since he became elected like the president, the left, the elite, has been trying to persecute him, right? Remember that when he became president? They were spreading, the media was spreading stories that Trump was a Russian agent. He was a spy of Putin. That's just nonsense. There's no evidence of that, but people believe that, okay? Then they were trying to say, then they tried to use the justice system against Donald Trump, right? They impeached him twice. They raided his house, okay? They're trying to send him to prison. A judge in Colorado tried to remove Donald Trump from the ballot, meaning you couldn't vote for him. So everything that the elite has done has been to destroy Donald Trump. And therefore, people on the right think this guy is our savior. He's Jesus, he's the Messiah, okay? Does that make sense? Now, let's think of this. If you are on the left, if you're the elite, if you're the rich, and you hate Donald Trump, there's exactly one way, and only one way, you could destroy Donald Trump forever. How? You guys know? What would you do if you really wanted to destroy Donald Trump, and you were like rich, and liberal, and elite? You go to Donald Trump, you have dinner together, and you say three words, and you will destroy him. What are these three words? What you say to Donald Trump, what you do is you say, let's be friends. Right? Why would that destroy Donald Trump? What's the appeal of Donald Trump? Why do people on the right love him? Why does Nagga love him? Because that's right, because he is an outsider. He's the enemy of the elites, because the elites hate him, okay? So all the elites have to do is become Donald Trump's friend, right? Invite Donald Trump to his parties, say all these nice things about him on the media and support Donald Trump. And then people on the right will be like, oh, we were fooled into thinking Donald Trump is outsider when he's actually an insider. Okay, then you've destroyed Donald Trump. Why won't they really do that? No, it's not because they're too proud, it's because what? Why won't they do that? Like, why won't they become friends with Donald Trump? And you know, it's something that Donald Trump probably wants as well, right? Yeah, it's hatred, okay, do you understand? it's peer hatred. I wanna kill this guy. Okay, do you understand? So you can see like the hatred between left and right. Remember that Donald Trump manifests all the right, okay, all the cultural values of the right, okay? And so people, the elite hate this guy so much that they wouldn't do anything to get rid of this guy. But the irony is that because of this angry hatred, They're doing everything to make Donald Trump invincible. Okay? This is what we call TDS or Trump Derangement Syndrome. The inability to recognize who Donald Trump is and the inability to think properly about how to deal with Donald Trump, okay? The not only are the elite trying as hard as they can to destroy Donald Trump, but At the same time, they're destroying the institutions and the narratives that hold America together. Ever since Donald Trump became president, the mainstream media, New York Times, CNN, Washington polls have relentlessly attacked him, therefore destroying their credibility, therefore destroying liberalism. It's the elites themselves who have destroyed the narratives and the institutions that find America together and it's all because of the hatred of Donald Trump. Okay. Does that make sense? So it's really going to be this hatred of Donald Trump that drives the second American civil war. Okay. All right. Does that make sense? All right. So let's see how this will play out. Okay. So what will start this civil war is, is in November Trump becomes president. Okay. So Trump becomes president. And the first thing that Trump has to figure out once he becomes president is, how does he stay in office for the rest of his life? The reason why is, the moment he leaves office, he's gonna be sued, he's gonna be put in jail, he's gonna be attacked by the elites. So the first thing he needs to figure out, the only thing that he actually cares about is, how do I stay in office for the rest of my life? Now, there's a trick he can use to stay in office for the rest of his life, okay? Because the Constitution says that you can only serve two terms as president. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says you can't serve as vice president for as long as you want. You understand? So what Trump can do in 2028 is have his son run for president and he becomes the vice president. But everyone will know that he'll still be the president. You understand? Does that make sense to you guys? That's a trick he can use in 2028, okay? Because I guarantee you the moment he steps into the White House, he's like, okay, how do I stay in here forever? It's either the White House or the jailhouse for me, okay? So he's going to think about how to stay in office. And the easiest thing he can do is half his son, Don Jr., run as president. He's run as vice president. But everyone will know that he's still a president. Does that make sense? So you can imagine that if Trump does this, then this will create a constitutional crisis in the country where the left go insane. We're talking about riots on the streets, civil conflict. Maybe New York City and Boston be like, we're leaving the union if Trump becomes president again. You have these insurgencies all around America to rebel against the Trump regime. So this is something that Trump can do in 2028. Now the question then is, what can he do to ensure that he wins in 2028? And the easiest answer is, in over the next two or three years, start a war with Iran. Start a war with Iran. The reason why this is important is that by starting a war with Iran, he wins over the deep state, right? He wins over the Israel lobby. He wins over the military industrial complex. He wins over a lot of the elite on his side. Okay, does that make sense? Now, we discussed that America cannot possibly win a war against Iran. This war can only drag on, right? Now, let me ask you this question. Why would this be good for Trump? If this, if in 2028, okay, he's running for vice president, his son is president, is running for president, and the war in Iran is dragging on, or it seems that the United States is gonna lose this war, why would this be good for Trump in 2028? The entire society, the entire left, is mobilized to get rid of Trump, right? Because they want this war in Iran to stop. So why would this war be good for Trump in 2028? Okay, I had to say this, okay? But there's gonna be a group of people who are doing anything they can to ensure that this war continues. And who are they? We're in America. There's a group of people who are the most pro-empire of everyone else. And they fight a war. They want to win the war. And they'll do anything they can to ensure that this war is won. And who are they? Which part of the military? Exactly. Do you understand? Special forces. DCI's are the problem, special forces. In 2028, if there's a war in Iran, And Trump is running again to maintain the war. I guarantee you, these guys and other steep state members will come in and commit acts of terrorism, acts of political assassination, to ensure that Trump wins. You'll also have election meddling, election interference. They're going to cheat on behalf of Trump. You understand? But if that's the case, if 2028 is an extremely contested election, then we can imagine at that point, the entire civil war blows up. New York City declares independence, Boston declares independence, California declares independence. You have all these wars breaking out across America. Meanwhile, the United States is still fighting this pointless war in Iran. So I think that's what's gonna happen. All right, any questions? Or is there anything you're not clear about? So the US military, so Jack's question is like, who are the US military support? So the US military is very complicated because it's divided into a lot of different departments. So the military is not one beast. It's like many, many different beasts. Second problem is how the leadership of the military is actually extremely democratic. But the base, the soldiers are extremely Republican. So you have this ideological mismatch between the leadership, the generals, and the soldiers. OK? So it's most likely that given these differences, the military does not intervene in the Civil War. OK? But there is a group in the military who has the leeway, the flexibility, and the will to intervene in this war, in its special forces. Right? Because they're not controlled by bureaucracy. Does that make sense? So the question then is, who will special forces support? And the answer is that different special force units will support different factions. That's why the Civil War can be extremely violent, because Americans will have access to guns. But these guys have access to jets and bombs and tanks. Does that make sense? Plus, again, each one of these guys can be a general in the war. Special forces is extremely powerful. Does that answer your question, Jack? Any more questions? So Celine asks a great question. And this is actually the most fundamental question. It is really impossible for the left to imagine that Donald Trump will attack Iran, because Trump is seen as extremely anti-war. Donald Trump, when he was a first term president, didn't start any wars. And so, the left is not expecting Donald Trump to clear war because he didn't do so and he's declared he won't do so. But here's what we know. First thing we know is that presidents on the campaign trail do things rather different from when they become president, okay? Every president is the same way. What you say in public before he become president, what you do as president are two very different things, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is that Donald Trump has recently said publicly that Joe Biden is not doing enough to protect Israel. Meaning that he will do more to support Israel. What does that mean? It means that he will give Israel more weapons and he will defend Israel against its enemies, which include Hezbollah and Iran. That's the second thing. The third thing is that there are now a group of billionaires who are coalescing around Donald Trump. And these billionaires are Merriam Adelson, who is the most pro-Israel billionaire in all of America. And she plans to give Donald Trump $90 million. That's a lot of money. But then you also have some like Stephen Swartzman and Bill Atman, okay? All these guys are extremely pro-Israel. They're Jewish billionaires who are extremely pro-Israel. Now, why are they giving Donald Trump a lot of money? It's because they want something, right? And what I'm guessing is what they want is for Donald Trump to make Nikki Haley, his vice president, okay? and to staff his cabinet, his government with pro-Israel individuals, who include Mike Pompeo, Mike Pompeo and others. In other words, don't trump presidency. The government is gonna extremely anti-Iran and pro-war with Iran. Niki Haley a couple weeks ago went to Israel. She visited Israel and she took a picture of herself. And what she did was she signed a bomb, okay? A bomb that was being dropped on Gaza and said, finish them. America loves Israel, Nikki Haley, okay? She's calling for mass genocide against the Palestinians. That's Nikki Haley, guys. All right, so, given the way things are turning out, I imagine that Nikki Haley becomes vice president. And that's good for Trump because she's a scapegoat now, right? Trump can say, hey, this war, it's all Nikki Halley's fault. Right? Okay? Also, Trump believed that he won in 2020, okay? He won in 2020. But why did he lose the presidency? Because a deep state rigged the election. And why did the deep state rig the election? Because he refused to fight wars. So if he wants to become president, then he has no choice but to play along with the deep state, okay, which means going on war. So a lot of what he will do as president depends on if he picks Nikki Haley to be VP or not. Well, no one argues if he wants Nikki Haley to be his VP, okay? But if he picks Nikki Haley as VP, that's a sure sign that he's gonna go to war with Iraq, I think, okay? because he'll be pushing for war with Iraq. But then the question is, how will Donald Trump's base react? Because his base is actually extremely anti-Nikki Healy and anti-war. And the answer is, at first what will happen is that the lead, the mainstream media, will support Trump in his war with Iraq. And you have a lot of people who supported Trump who felt betrayed. But then over time what will happen is that Donald Trump will figure out how to manipulate his base so that his base comes back to him. You understand? And so there are different ways he can do that. First of all, what he can do is blame Nikki Haley in the deep sense as, oh, I was fooled I was manipulated. I now want out of this war, okay? After he wins in 2028, he can change directions and say I now want to end this war and make America into a Christian isolationist theocracy, okay? Okay, do you understand? That's something that he can do, all right? Something that he can do is go against Israel, okay? Israel, okay? And just say that it's Israel that plan all this, okay? It's Israel that inspired to trick America into going to war. You can't say that. And there'll be a lot of people who say that, okay? It was the Jews who conspired against us, all right? So there's a lot of things he can say. But whatever he does, all it's gonna do is create more war, okay? We're in America. All he's gonna do is inflame the Civil War. We don't know what he does. There's gonna be people who love him and there are people who hate him and they're gonna go war with each other. And that's why I think Donald Trump, as long as he's in office, the Civil War is gonna break out and it's gonna be very, very violent. I mean, again, I don't know what it is about Donald Trump, but he brings up the worst in people. In 2016, before Donald Trump was president, America was actually a pretty sane place. Now it's insane. Now it's like you can't recognize it anymore. Now I mean, I'll be honest with you, I am very much on the left. I think like a person on the left, my values are extremely liberal left values. And in 2016, when Trump became president, I was traumatized. I believed the world had fallen apart. I believed the world was destroyed. Everything that I believed in was destroyed. And it took me a long time to step out of the trauma. But I still have these liberal friends. And the moment we talk about Trump, if I say anything nice about Trump, which is like, OK, you know what? Trump is an idiot, but he's representing people who feel marginalized. They become so angry with me, okay? I feel insecure or unsafe. I feel as though they're about to punch me, okay? If I say anything nice about Donald Trump, then people will want to punch me, okay? And like under friend. I've known him for like decades. And they know that I hate Donald Trump as much as anyone, okay? But you are now, let's say, I think nice about Donald Trump among liberals and leftist people. So, does that answer your question, Celine? So it's complicated, okay? But I think this is what could happen. Any more questions? Okay, so this goes back to the question of empire, okay? So again, unfortunately, there are a lot of Americans who benefit from empire. That's what they want war to be ran. So these people work on Wall Street, they work for the military industrial complex, and they tend to live in the suburbs. Any more questions? Is there anything you're not clear about? Does this argument make sense to you? Does the logic here make sense to you guys? Is there anything you don't want me to clarify? Okay, alright. So next class, we'll talk about what happens afterwards, okay? So what this is telling us is that America is going to retreat from the world. But when America retreats from the world, we will live in a multipolar world. Okay? So next class, we'll discuss what this multipolar world looks like. Okay?"}

So welcome to the first class of the second semester. This semester we are going to build on what we've learned the first semester to better understand human history and to better understand what's happening in the world today. And also to be able to predict the future. Okay, so if you have been following Kurt events, and I hope you have, There are now three major conflicts in the world. The first and most devastating is the war in Ukraine, where Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict for about three years now. And a lot of people have died. There's controversy over the exact number, But it's possible that over a million soldiers have died in this war so far. And even though President Donald Trump of the United States has shown signs that he wants to end the war, we don't really know when the war will end. So this war in Ukraine, it is still happening. And it's affecting everything and everyone because obviously it brings a lot of instability and uncertainty in the world. But it's also drawing up prices. And it's making things inconvenient. So when you fly to the United States, you'll discover that it takes you long to fly to the United States because you can't fly through Russia. You have to fly around Russia. So that's the first major conflict. The second conflict, which is not as deadly, but which will probably prove to be even more dangerous, is the war in the Middle East, the conflict in the Middle East. As you know, for the past couple of years, Israel has been in conflict with basically most of its neighbors. It's launched an expedition into the Gaza Strip against Hamas, for what Hamas did on October 7th. It's launched a war against Lebanon. It's involved in Syria. And the signs tell us that this conflict will spread. Trump has come in and promised a resolution to the conflict. But as I will show you this semester, There are historical, structural forces that make this conflict possibly the beginning of World War III. This conflict will only increase. The great fear right now is Israel attacks Iran and drives the United States into war with Iran. And this will mark the beginning of World War III, and this could possibly lead to the end of the world as we know it today. If the United States attacks Iran, both Russia and China must intervene in some capacity. Does that make sense to you guys? Iran right now, it's the linchpin of the global economy. The first reason is there's a lot of oil in Iran in the Middle East. And China, South Korea, and Japan get most of its oil from the Middle East, right? So if the oil supply is cut off, then the Chinese economy, the South Korean economy, the Japanese economy, basically all of Asia faces economic collapse and catastrophe. The second is, if you look at a map, Iran is really the center of the world, meaning most of the world's trade goes through that area, especially something called the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has a capacity to cut off all trade in the Strait of Hormuz, and that would be catastrophe for the global economy. And if that would happen, then the Western powers would need to get involved in order to free up the street of Hormuz, and then Russia, India, China, who knows? Okay, but a lot of people would have to get involved in order to protect their economic interests. So I will go into the semester, we'll talk a lot about what's driving the conflict in the Middle East. There are these geopolitical factors, as I discussed, but there are also these religious factors that we looked into a bit last semester, but I will explain more this semester. And then the third and final conflict is basically the United States against the world. What I mean by that is that ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1991, we have been living in something called a unipolar moment, meaning there's only one hegemon, one superpower. And as such, the United States has been able to dictate policy, especially economic policy around the world. United States controls all trade. We have to use the US dollar in order to trade. The United States also uses its military to protect shipping lanes. And this is a criticism called the Pax Americana, the American peace. And this, of course, has brought tremendous prosperity to the world. China would not have grown as fast as China did without the Pax Americana. It is American warships that allow Chinese ships to sail safely around the world to deliver goods around the world. But this unipolar movement has also created a lot of conflict. The main conflict being the United States can invade any country for no reason. 2003 invaded Iraq for no reason. It destroyed Libya for no reason. It almost ensured Syria for no reason. So the number of countries United States has gone and destroyed are just staggering. And that's why Russia under Putin, because it felt bullied, it felt disrespected, that's why Russia is now in conflict with the United States. And strangely enough, this conflict has caused the United States to go into conflict with the rest of the world. Okay, so as you may know, United States right now under Trump has declared or is about to launch trade wars against a lot of countries. Canada, Mexico, quite possibly very quickly, the European Union and the United States is already at economic war with Russia and China. Okay, so we will go into this mess. We will also discuss this semester why this is happening. Again, my argument to you is that if you know enough history, if you study the historical structural forces that drive global conflict, then you'll understand what's going on. And you will also be able to predict what will happen. Does that make sense? OK. So what I want to talk today is about a new model of historical analysis. How can we understand the movement of history? Why do people do what they do? Why do nations go to war? Why do nations have peace? So I'm looking at grand history. I'm looking at the large structural movement of history. And in the past, there have been two main models for understanding historical development. So the first is the idea of a cycle or a circle. And this makes sense, because this mirrors what we experience in life. when we are born, but then we die. And then other people are born and then they die. So it's a cycle. You look at the seasons. There's winter, but that gives rise to spring, which then gives rise to summer, then the fall, then winter again. It's a cycle. So for most of human history, most people have understood the movement of the world as a cycle. There's certainly true in Chinese history. Dynasty's rise because they have the menace of heaven, heaven favors them. And they do justice when they first arise, but over time, for a right of reasons, because of corruption, because there's a bad emperor, they lose menace of heaven, which allows a rebellion, which then creates a new dynasty. So Chinese history is almost a continuous cycle of dynastic rise and decline. Now, in the Western context, there's also a cycle. There are many different cycles, but let me explain one cycle that we've noticed in the Greek and Roman world. The cycle is this. There are three major factions in a society. There is the people, there is nobility, and then there is the king, or a great person. And each of these factions have a particular strength. The people, their strength comes from their numbers. They have mass. The nobility is only my minority of people, but they have authority. They are respected because they know more. They are better at war than ordinary people, but they have authority. People respect them. And the king has the army. So these are the three major forces or factions in the society. And these three factions are always in conflict. And what happens is a changing alliance where the two of the three get together to beat one. And then this forces a new alliance. So what happens is this. You first have something called a olarkarchy, where the nobility is in charge and everyone has to do what they do, what they command. Okay? Over time, this olarkarchy becomes corrupt. And the way they become corrupt is by exploiting people for debt. All right? So in a nobility, the nobles own the land, You got to work the land, but you get a share. And that's fine. But sometimes the weather is bad. So you can't work the land. You can't pay me the rent. So I give you a loan. And over time, this loan becomes a debt. And at a certain point, you can't pay off the debt. So what happens? You become my slave. And your children become my slave as well. So this creates a lot of conflict in society. How does this conflict resolve? Because one of nobility wants to be king. And he sees an opportunity in the civil conflict between the people and nobility. So he tells the people, if you make me king, I will clear your debts. And this creates a monarchy. And the first king is usually a good king, because he had to work hard to obtain his position and people love him for the fact that he cleared away their debts. This is what we call it, jubilee by the way. The word is jubilee. And this happens a lot in human history. But the problem is the king has a son who's not so good. And then the son has a son who's awful, OK? And so the ability to get angry, The people get angry and they rebel and they create a democracy. Okay? But then in the democracy, because what happens in the democracy is it's the best people or the best speakers, the wealthiest people who control the votes. And so they get together, and what do they do? And what do they do? They create an R-larkey. Okay? Do you see how the cycle works? The second loop goes on and on and on. These three factions, always on conflict with each other. And the way they form alliances creates a certain form of government. When the nobility is in charge in an oligarchy, but then a king and the people work together or throw in a creative monarchy. And then the king becomes corrupt and so the nobility and the people work together democracy. Okay? And you can see the cycle happening today in the United States as well. Right? Because who is Trump? Trump is a king. Does that make sense to you guys? What is Trump saying? Trump is saying to the people, the elite are corrupt. The elite are stealing from you. The elite are lying to you. Vote for me and I will destroy the elite and I will give you more economic opportunities. Okay? Do you understand? So this is a really important idea. Trump is not going to be president for four years. His ambition is to be king. And we see the cycle throughout human history. So that's the idea of a cycle. We also have another model of human historical development, which is a line. A line. And the idea of progress towards truth. So that's the other competing model. There are two main models. There's a cycle, and then there's a line. And the idea of a line is, human society does not go on and on in the use of cycle. It is moving towards a truth. It is moving towards a good end. So this idea has been around for a very long time. Remember in the Bible, when King David first sponsored the Bible, the Bible was a line where, yeah, with a God, he was looking for a friend. He was looking for someone who he could trust to rule his kingdom of heaven. And he first tried Adam and Eve and they disobeyed him. Then he tried Noah, then he tried Abraham, and then he tried Moses. And then he found his true friend, who is David. So the truth is David in the Hebrew Bible. Then you have the Romans. Remember, the Romans, Virgil, wrote something called the Inead. And in the Inead, Troy was destroyed so that Rome could be founded. And when Rome was founded, Rome will have to fight this series of wars that will eventually lead to the rise of Augustus Caesar. And this will create something called the Pax Romana. And this is the end of history. This is where all movement ends. Because once you achieve the Pax Romana, there'll be no more war. So they have a line. Obviously, this is not true. But back then, when they came up with this history, they thought it was true. And if you know a little bit about current history, then you'll know about a man named Francis Fukuyama, who is an American, who works for the government. And he wrote something called the End of History, which is an essay arguing that when the Soviet Union fell, It showed the end of history. Before history was about ideas, communism, capitalism, and now with the father-in-chief of the Union, we now know that Western liberal consumer democracy is the best system in the world. We no longer have to argue about this. Everyone should try to be a liberal consumer democracy, including China. And if everyone became a consumer liberal democracy, there will be no more war. We want to fight because we're too busy spending money. And the best way to make money is through trade, not war. We now also know this is not true. But the main proponents of the line theory of history, progress of history, are actually Christians. Christians. Why? because they believe that Jesus marks a turning point in history. And when Jesus came, it marked a progress towards truth. What is truth? Truth is the second coming of Jesus, which will mark the end of the world. When Jesus returns, he will usher in a millennium, a thousand years of peace. When he will be king, we will all have to obey him. What I will show you in the future when we discuss crusades and crusades is that this idea, it sounds like a simple idea, but this idea is what's driving a lot of the Catholic in the Middle East. Believe it or not, but there are millions of Christians. They're called Christian Zionists, by the way, who want war in the Middle East because if there's war in the Middle East and the world is about to end, Jesus has to return from heaven to save us. Okay? You think this is silly, you think this is crazy, but I'm telling you right now, this idea which millions of people around the world believe in, it's one of the main causes of the war in the Middle East. And guys, crazy ideas make crazy events. So there are people who literally believe that we can save the world by ending it. It's only the threat of nuclear holocaust. It's only the threat of the end of Israel that will force Jesus to return issuing a second coming. Now what's important for us to understand is that these are the two basic frameworks of history. But there are variations to these two basic models. So for example, Hegel, we'll discuss Hegel later on in the semester. He's really important. But he has this idea called the dialectic. The dialectic just means a conflict, a conversation. So what he believes is that history is driven by ideas that are in conflict with each other. Wherever there's an idea, for example, let's just say you have capitalism. then what will happen is a new idea will rise to challenge the existing idea, we'll call communism, okay? And then what will happen is these two ideas will merge together and they will draw on the best part of each other and we can call this socialism. All right, so it's a line, okay? But it's like this almost, right? There's an idea, something comes in conflict, and then this leads to a new idea, which then leads to a new idea, okay? But he still believes that we are progressing towards the truth through this conflict, right? So we discuss Hegel and his theory of the dialectic later on in the semester. And this will lead, and the idea of the dialectic will lead to, of course, Marxism, okay? So Marx is drawing a lot on Hegel and another philosopher named Emmanuel Kant for his theory of communism. But we'll do that later on in a semester. All right, so these are the two main models of historical development. You have the cycle, the historical, or you have the line. You either believe that things move in continuous motion or they're moving towards an end. Does that make sense? Any questions about these two models so far? OK, so what you will learn this semester is a new model of historical development. It's a much more complicated model than these two models. But I think it is much more useful in helping us predict the causes of historical development. OK? I want to argue why these two models don't really work. And it has to do with the fact that history as an economic discipline, it is not very good. It is not. What I mean by that is, you look at the world today, there's this Trump presidency, there's this conflict in Ukraine, there's the Middle East conflict, and you would expect historians to come out and say, oh, this has happened before, and we can then predict what will happen and so this is what's gonna happen, okay? But guess what guys, they're not doing that. Also, they're not very good at predicting things. They're just not. His history is notorious for not being able to tell us much about the future. And they sort of say, well, it's because we look at the past. And for me, this is frustrating because if the history is any good, The history is accurate. Then it should help us predict the future, or at least better understand the present. So the idea of truth, what is truth? Well, truth does two things. First, it explains, why did this happen? What did war two start? And the answer we have today is like, Hitler was a bad guy, he was evil. That doesn't explain much for us. And then it also has to predict. it predicts. If it's truthful, then it predicts. And history doesn't do that. So I want to fix this problem by introducing a new model of history, which is a lot more complicated. I'll be honest with you, it's a lot more complicated. But I think for our purposes, it's more useful at explaining why things happen the way they do. And it helps us also predict what will happen. Okay? And this model is what I call the oceanic currents of history. Imagine the world as a huge ocean. And within each ocean, there's an ecosystem which has currents. And then these currents come into conflict with each other, which leads to a new development. So think about hurricanes. And the thing that's really important about this model that I'm proposing is there's no moral judgment in it. Okay? I mean, obviously in the line, the end where we're going is good and where we're at now is bad. But what I'm saying is there's more judgment saying this is good, this is bad. It's not helpful. It doesn't really tell us anything. All right? Okay, I'm much more interested in explaining why this happened, how this happened, and where this is going. Okay, so let's look at the world to understand this theory. What I'll show you is the world is not into cultural ecosystems. Cultural ecosystems. This is a really important idea you need to know for the rest of the semester. What I will argue is that culture is the meta-reality. Meta-reality. So what's meta-reality? Meta-reality is the understanding of the world from which all other understandings derive. So what I'm saying is that culture is the most important part of who you are. Much more important than your gender, much more important than your race, your ethnicity, much more important than your economic demographic, okay, your rich or poor, okay? So to understand this idea why culture's so important, I will do a thought experiment, okay? A thought experiment. And the thought experiment is this. Let's take a random guy from China 2000 years ago, okay? This random guy will take him off the streets and will put him into China today. All right? Now, in 2000 years, China has changed a lot, right? We now have the internet, we have computers, we have cell phones, we have skyscrapers, we have cars, we have roads, okay? So China has changed a lot in these 2000 years. How long would it take him for him to adapt to the new China? And I would say, I would say at most five to 10 years. Because even though on the surface, China changed a lot, deep down inside, China's culture has stayed consistent for the past three to 4,000 years. So he would understand how to make friends. He would understand if he were to get a job, how to associate with his boss and his colleagues. If we would get married, Do we know how to raise these children to have them succeed in China? Okay, does that make sense to you guys? It would take them time to learn how to use a cell phone and how to use a computer and how to drive a car, but he can do so. Does that make sense? Now let's do another experiment. Let's take a random guy from China today and put him in Germany today. Germany, okay? So I will argue is this, he will never ever be able to adapt to the culture. He may get a job as a pizza delivery man, who knows, okay? But he will never ever make friends who are German. He won't find a German wife. Whatever job he does, he won't know how to succeed. He won't know what to say to his boss. He won't know how to associate with his boss. Does that make sense? This is a guy who knows the internet, who knows how to drive a car, who can speak English, but because of the culture, he's always a stranger. Doesn't make sense. This slide experiment, I hope, shows you the persistence of culture. It's the most important part of who you are. It drives everything else. It drives how you see the world. It drives how you interact with others. Okay? So what matters is the culture and nothing else. And what I want to show you is the semester is the world can be divided into cultural ecosystems because of the history, because of the geography, because of the demographics. Okay? Doesn't make sense. So look, Europe is a cultural ecosystem. All right, meaning someone from Germany can go to Italy and still feel at home. They don't speak the same language, the geography is different, but they share the same cultural orientation, the same cultural values. All right, someone who lives in the Middle East, okay? Well, so something called the Levant. Israel and other places, okay? It's basically the Middle East. That's also another cultural ecosystem. Then you have the steps. So remember the steps are this grassland, this ocean of grassland that basically extends from Hungary to Mongolia. And then you have China, India. So there are these different ecosystems, cultural ecosystems that are determined by their geography, their history, and the demographics. and cultures respond to geography, history, and demographics. Does that make sense? Now, what I will show you is that within each ecosystem, they're always interacting with each other. They're always interacting with each other. And when they change, they change their interaction with each other. So let's ask a really important question, which is why do empires? Why do they fall? Why do they decline? Why do they fail? And this is a really important question. How was it possible for the Roman Empire to collapse? How were the Greeks able to defeat the Persian Empire? How were the Mongolians and the Montes able to conquer the Chinese Empire? And what I will show you the semester is, when this happens, when empire is conquered, the pattern is the same. There's a consistent pattern in this, all right? So let me explain the pattern. And then for the semester, we'll go into specific instances of this pattern to explore the specifics, okay? Does that make sense? All right, so what happens is this, why empire is fall is, there's usually an empire, okay? let's just say Rome. And as expand, they encounter something called the borderlands, borderlands. Borderlands are just places that are the intersections of empires. So Mongolia is the borderland of the Chinese empire. Arabia is the borderland of the Byzantine and the Sasanian Persian empires. And the borderlands and the empire become at first symbiotic. Meaning they depend on each other. They work with each other in three ways. The first and the first most simple way that they interact is through trade. They trade with each other. Second way they interact is through military cooperation. So what often happens is the empire needs mercenaries. And it turns out that people who live in the borderlands make very good soldiers, okay? Because they live in a time of war and chaos. In the borderlands, there's no central authority. So they're always fighting each other. So they make very good soldiers. And then the third way they interact with each other is some people in the borderlands will raid and pillage the empire, the outskirts of the empire for resources, okay? So they are interacting with each other. So the pattern is this. The borderlands first start off as maybe an isolated region of the world. So Arabia, the steppes, and the Germanic north, what we call Scandinavia today, the Norsemen. So these are isolated parts. But as the empire expands, they start to interact with these isolated ecosystems. And when they interact, what happens is these borderlands become energized. It's like the empire is adding fuel to the borderlands by giving them more wealth, by giving them more knowledge, by giving them more access to information. It doesn't make sense. And over time, what happens is, because of this new energy, the borderlands become much more populated, much more wealthy, much more knowledgeable. And then it creates internal conflicts within their borderlands. And the only way for them to resolve this conflict is to expand. They have to expand now. And in the process of expansion, what happens is, now and then, they will conquer the empire. That's the pattern. The borderlands are first these isolated regions that no one knows much about. They're like the stuff of legend and myth. When the empire expands, it energizes these borderlands. The energy makes these borderlands more wealthy, more populated, and more militarily sophisticated. That's great conflicts within the borderlands. Too many people, so what are they forced to do? They're forced to expand. And during this course of this expansion, they come into conflict with the empire. And now and then, they will conquer the empire, become the new empire. That's the pattern. And it happens all over human history. OK? This is how the Mongolians conquered China. This is how the Montes conquered China. Before the Mongolians and the Montes conquered China, there was trade. The Chinese empire was using them as mercenaries. There was also a lot of small conflict. Does that make sense? All right. So now that I explain the pattern, The question then is, why would this happen? Why would this happen? How is it possible for the borderlands, which again, is only a fraction of the wealth, the population, and the resource of the empire, how are they able to conquer the empire? And this is a really important lesson you will learn in this class, which is empires are destined to collapse. empires must collapse. All right? So why is that the case? In this class, you will learn there are three boundary conditions of all societies. Eventually all societies must collapse for three reasons. All right, the first reason is elite overproduction. Second reason is ratutopia. And the third reason is financialism. All right, so let me explain the first, financialism. What do I mean by that? All right, when a society first starts, it's important for people to contribute to its growth. I can do that by starting a farm. When I build a farm, I make goods, I'm creating wallets for the society, right? You can also do that by building a factory. But over time what happens is you eventually realize that it's more profitable for you to lend money than to build things. Doesn't make sense. It's as much profitable, much easier for you to be a capitalist than this to be an entrepreneur over time. So there's this very famous French economist. His name is Thomas Piketty. And he wrote a book called Capital in the 21st Century. It's a very good book. It's very easy to read, and it's one of the most discussed books right now. And he makes the argument, he makes the argument why inequality happens. Inequality in society happens because of the nature of capital, right? The nature of money. What money does is it seeks to grow for the sake of growing. And what's the best way for capital to grow? By consolidating and charging rents. Does that make sense? So the example is, OK, there are five restaurants in Beijing. They're trying to compete against each other for customers, right? So they lower prices and try to get better food. But eventually, at some point, they figure out, Hey, we're five restaurants, man. We can just get together and negotiate a cartel, a deal, where we charge all high prices, right? Then we make more money that way. That's something we call rent-sinking behavior, rent-sinking. Native rent-sinking is to create a monopoly which forces people to buy whatever prices you charge them, okay? That's the ultimate goal of industry or society or business, okay, to engage in rent-sickening behavior. And over time, because capital consolidates, it's much more profitable to engage in capitalism than is to engage in entrepreneurship. It meaning you're better off actually investing in the start market than you are in getting a job. In fact, what he shows is the return on financial capitalism is 5% a year. On average, if you put $100 in the stock market, you make $5. With a return on the real economy, it's only 2%. Meaning, if you start a factory and you hire people or start a restaurant which contributes real growth, real wealth economy, you want to make 2%. And that's why if you go to America, and you will go to America eventually, you'll find that young people, your age, they're not working. What are they doing? They're investing in Bitcoin. They're playing the real estate market. They're investing in stocks, do you understand? Because you make more money doing that than you do by doing real work, by creating company. You understand? In other words, your society isn't producing any value. And as a result, your economy can't move on, right? Doesn't make sense? And when you're in this situation, what are you forced to do now? If you're a society and you want to continue you, what are you forced to do? To me? No. What do you do? Historically, what have studies done in order to get out of this situation where financialism has destroyed your society. Make war, guys. You understand? Because you make war, you destroy things. We destroy things, you're forced to rebuild things. It doesn't make sense. That's why we have war. Because war means a game reset. It allows society to rebuild itself. So that's the first idea I want you guys to understand. Over time, the economy matures to a point where everyone becomes a renter, okay? Sorry, a renter. You're trying to be a landlord, you're trying to charge people to use your land. You don't want to work. This is true throughout the world, right? In China, it's the same thing throughout Chinese history. Right now in the West, it's the same thing as well. Okay? And at that point, you have no choice but to start war to reset your society, or your society will continue to decline. Okay? So the first boundary condition, what societies must die. Second boundary condition is the idea of rat utopia. Okay? So we discussed this a bit last semester. I want to refresh your memory. Rat utopia is an experiment that's been done many times, but the idea is this. What happens to rats in a perfect world? Many rats have an extremely ritualized society. So for example, if you want to mate, what male rats do is they go on top of a mound where all the female rats can see them. The male rats start to dance. They dance really in a very strange way. But that attracts attention to female. The male rat sees the attention of the female rat, and the male rat starts to chase the female rat. The female rat runs back into her burrow, her home, and hides. The male rat has to stand outside and wait for the female rat to come out. When she comes out, she will start running again, and he will start chasing her. And then she'll run back into her furrow again. And they do this multiple times until eventually the female rat lets him catch her, and then they will have sex and they'll be married and have children. Okay? So that's right society. It's no different from human society, right? You like a girl or a boy, you guys go out for a coffee date and a lunch date and a dinner date. Then eventually after a couple of years, you might have sex and get married and have children. Okay? No different. It's a very heavily rich lies society. What experimenters did was they asked themselves, what would happen if we made a perfect world where no one had to fight for food? Every day, food would come down from the heavens and all the rats could do whatever they want. They were not complete freedom. This is what we call ratatopia. A turnout, all started to collapse. It was a complete disaster. The male rats start to rape female rats. There's no more like playing around. There's no more ritual. It was all just rape and murder. It was a complete breakdown of society. Why did this happen? Okay, there are many different theories. But one thing that you need to understand about rats and humans is we all like status. Status. Okay, and the idea is this. We humans, we're all standing in line to go onto a mountain top. Okay, the mountain top ever respects you you make a lot of money you feel good about yourself And we're all standing in line and this line takes a long time But eventually you will get to the mountain top This is how this game works is people the mountain top have to fall off and die in order for other people to climb up Okay, does that make sense? But what happens when? The people the mountain top don't die Well, you're just stuck in line When you're stuck in line, I'm not sure if you've been stuck in line for like hours and hours, but you get angry, right? You get frustrated. So what do you do? Well, you hit someone behind you and then that person gets angry and hits back hits you back Okay, eventually that's this line and what's funny each other and build them out on top or enjoy each other are enjoying the view They have status and they're never gonna die. They're never gonna fall off and this is our society today guys Okay, the people of power in in China in the United States are on the world have been there for a long long time and they're not dying. So what are young people doing? Tung Ping, Ba Lan, right? Quite quitting, lying flat. Because you don't see any opportunities. What you want is that money, what you want is status and that requires you to achieve a certain level in society. But those positions are being occupied by people who refuse to die. And as a result, society collapses. Young people refuse to work, they refuse to get married and have children. So your society dies, you understand? So radiotopia is the second boundary condition. Does that make sense, guys? You're seeing this around the world today, all right? Ask yourselves, why is it that you yourself are not motivated? The answer is, you really don't see an opportunity to climb to the top and enjoy status. You just don't. Because you aren't dying. This is not. And why? Because we've achieved a certain level of abundance and wealth that allows people to keep on living. Okay, does that make sense? Any questions before I continue? Are you guys clear about this? And the third boundary condition is the idea of elite overproduction. What is elite overproduction? Well, it's the same as radiotopia, but radiotopia is a conflict between the half and the half-nots. Elite overproduction is a conflict among the halves, they're very wealthy. Because even though there's a limited number of status positions, too many elite people are being produced. So it's not only that the children of poor people are being screwed over in the system, it's the children of the elite are being screwed over in the system. And this creates conflict in the system because the poor can't do anything. They can just fight each other in line, but the elite can do something. They can go war against each other. They can start killing each other. This great civil war. In fact, if you are to look at America today, you can see there's a civil war going on between two different factions of the elite. Does that make sense? And this is what drives a lot of history, where a lot of revolutions happen not because the poor are trying to overflow the rich. It's because the low nobility is fighting for opportunities against the upper nobility. Doesn't make sense, guys. We're seeing this again today in China and also in the United States. So these are the three main boundary conditions. So, now let's apply to these three boundary conditions and ask yourselves why empires collapsed. Well, the first reason is because most people in the empire don't want to live there. They're just stuck living there. Why do most people don't want to live there? Because they are in debt, okay? Debt and lendlessness. Throughout most of human history, Empires that have persisted for the longest have this huge problem where the majority of the population suffers from too much debt and suffers from too much landlessness, no opportunities. Okay? Then what happens is the elite starts fighting amongst themselves. There's corruption. Why is there corruption? Because the elite are struggling to engage in rancid behavior amongst themselves. Okay, they're trying to steal more, there's certainly more and more. So there's corruption. There's civil conflict and there's corruption. So it's only a matter of time before the empire collapses. But during this time, what does the empire do? OK, it's really strange and funny. But what they do is this. They import the people from the borderland in order to try to resolve their civil conflicts. It doesn't make sense. You can't trust the army anymore because the army is made up of people who have too much debt and who are landless. So what do you do? You hire four mercenaries. Right? That's what China does. Or that's what China did in its history. You can't trust your own army so you hire four mercenaries. And eventually what happens is you replace your army with four mercenaries. And then, eventually, what happens? The four mercenaries take over your empire. That's what happened in Rome. That's what happened throughout human history. OK, so now that we've discussed the empire, I want to look at the borderlands. Why is it true that the borderlands are able to conquer the empire? And my argument to you is culture. Sorry, culture. It's cultural. So we have this prejudice or misunderstanding about civilization. Civilization. Civilization is about cities. It's about writing. It's about technology. It's about wealth. And if you looked at it that way, then you don't really understand why is it these borderlands, The Mongolians among Jews, the Vikings, the Arabians, the Greeks, why are they able to conquer these empires? That makes no sense to you. So what I'm trying to tell you is, this is the wrong way of looking at it. A better way of looking at it is culture. In the borderlands, there's a certain culture that develops because it's a borderlands. It's a culture that focuses on freedom, Egotteranism and self-reliance, independence. This is true for the borderlands. If we were to go back to the Mongolia during the time of Genghis Khan, if we were to go back to the European north of the time of Vikings, these are cultures that emphasize freedom, egotteranism, and self-reliance. And as such, these were amazing warriors. So let's look at an example. Let's look at the Vikings, okay? The Vikings didn't know how to read or write. They didn't have any mathematics. They didn't have cities. But from age two or three, their kids were learning how to swim, how to roll bolts, how to cook, how to hunt, how to fight, how to ride horses. Doesn't make sense. And what are civilized kids doing? They're learning how to do test questions. In a war, who's gonna win? Well, obviously these guys. Doesn't make sense. So these are the, this is the idea of the oceanic currents. You have these isolated areas that are ecosystems amongst themselves. As the empire expands, just think of it as a current. The imperial current, it's just expanding, that's what empires do. it energizes these areas. And these areas actually have much more energetic potential than the empire, which is dying, okay? And this energy forces so much energy in this borderland that they are now become like a hurricane and they have to ride through history. Sometimes they're defeated, but sometimes like the Greeks, like the Vikings, like the Mongolians, Like the Arabians, they win. And when they win, they create a lot of destruction, okay? And that's the idea I want you to implant in your head. These are currents. These are natural forces that are unstoppable. Once they start, you cannot stop them, okay? This war in Ukraine, it is a hurricane that will engulf all of Europe. This war in the Middle East, it's a hurricane that will engulf the entire world. Once it starts, you can't have a conference and decide to end it. If these things cannot end until they reach their natural course, okay? The hurricane stopped when it runs out of energy. Doesn't make sense. The hurricane does not negotiate with you and said, oh, well, you make a very good case for why I shouldn't destroy you, so I'll just stop. Hurricanes don't do that. Okay, these are natural forces, right? And this is what I will show you this semester. And I will also show you how this connects to current events. And then once we do that, we should be able to predict current events. And just to let you know, spoiler alert, things will not end well. We are looking at the complete under-destruction of the world we live in today. Nothing will be the same because these are oceanic currents. They destroy everything in its path. Once you unleash them, they must destroy. It's only a question of how much. All right. Was this clear to you guys? Any questions? Anything you want me to clarify or elaborate? Again, I know this is a big theory, but we will be doing a lot of examples throughout the course of the semester. And this will give you a unified theory of history. And you'll see how everything connects together. Any questions? Oh, that's a good question. What starts these hurricanes, or what starts this process? So if you look at an ocean, you will discover that these currents are happening all the time. There's no start. They're always in motion. So once you start an empire, you're starting already to unleash a hurricane in the borderlands. Once the hurricane matures in the borderlands, it will overwhelm an empire, which will then start to energize a new borderland. Does that make sense? So that's a really good question. And unfortunately, the answer is there will always be hurricanes. Hurricanes are always forming. You just have to figure out where they're forming in order to predict where they're coming from. But obviously, the two big hurricanes right now are what's happening in Ukraine and what's happening in Israel, in the Middle East. but other hurricanes are coming. For example, there will eventually be a conflict in East Asia. Now, a lot of people are saying the conflict will be between China and the United States. I do not think that's the case. I do not think the conflict will be between the United States and China. I think it will involve Japan and South Korea. It will not be over the Taiwan Strait. It would involve South Korea and Japan. How so I don't really know, okay? Another conflict is what's happened in America. America is itself a hurricane. Eventually America will have to fight a civil war. And when you go to America, you will see how divided the country is, all right? And people are already predicting a civil war. It's the only question of when. I think things will speed up in 2028. The reason why is the election in 2028 will be heavily contested. People are going to argue over who won. And it'll be very unclear who won in 2028. And there's a very good chance Trump will run again in 2028. But I think these are two big currents that are coming along the way. Not now, but they're coming along the way. The big scary hurricane, of course, is Iran. Eventually, the United States and Iran will come to conflict with each other. And this will drag in the entire world. Does that make sense to you, Eva? Thanks for the question. Any more questions? Until an overwhelmed Samper. That's a great question. So we have to figure out what is driving the hurricane. And the answer is the internal conflicts within the borderlands. It doesn't make sense. So there's just too many people. And there's just not enough status positions. So they go off and they conquer their own territory. So if you look at the Vikings, the Vikings, So Vikings are interesting. The Vikings, which we'll discuss a lot, they're in Northern Europe. And for most of human history, we had actually no idea they were there, okay? They were in the North, in Denmark, in Norway, in Sweden, and they basically kept it in itself. They still traded the world, but we didn't really know much about them, okay? And then they started to come out of nowhere. And they did three things. They went over to colonize Greenland and Iceland. All right? went to actually North America. So they were actually the first Europeans to reach North America. So one side that they had was to expand and explore and colonize. But then you also had a group of Vikings, Northmen, who went to attack France. And they were such a huge problem that the French decided to give them their own land called Normandy. Normandy, the land of the North people, Normandy. And then they went over here to Ukraine along the Denver River because they were trading with the Islamic Empire. And they founded colonies or new settlements. And this was a peaceful process because they were trying to establish trading posts. And this became the basis of which country, do you guys know? Russia. You see people will call the roost. I actually don't know what roost means, but it just means roost. And that's where Russia comes from. So this is the beginning of a new country called Russia. And Normandy is interesting because they eventually went off to conquer a new country called, you guys know, who they conquered? Who did the Normans conquer? 1066, guys. England, Britain. You understand? So the Hercan stops when the people just run up energy because they've reached a point where they can't go on. The Hercan is created because they have wealth, power, but they don't have enough status, positions, so that they expand to fill these status positions. This is actually what drives empire building. Does that make sense? It's not because you lack resources, it's because you have too many people who want status. You can't leave them in society because then they will overflow you. So you send them somewhere else. All right? Good. Is that clear, Eiko? Great. Any more questions? Great. So I hope this was clear. We will continue discussing this throughout the semester because this becomes a framework for which you understand all of European history for the past 3,000 years. So next class we will do the Roman Empire, the fall on the climate of the Roman Empire, which will lead us into the rise of something called the Holy Roman Empire, which is not the Roman Empire, okay? It's basically the French Empire, or the Frankreich Empire. And the Frankreich Empire will lead to the rise of the Vikings. All right? All right, so those are the next three classes. All right, great."}

And she makes the argument that for the longest time, for most of its history, Europe was egalitarian, peaceful, and artistic. But today we are a patriarchy. There's a lot of inequality, And we're always at war with each other. So what changed? And last time we discussed that old Europe was conquered by a war-like people who we call today the Yemnaya. So three questions I wanna answer in today's class is, first of all, who are the Yemnaya? The second question is where they come from. The third question is how they conquer Europe, okay? All right, so let's go back in time and look at the world about 10,000 years ago, okay? So we believe that about 11,000 years ago, in the Near East, we develop agriculture. We develop the technology of farming. And as we discussed in our very first class, it was because humans are religious people. And farming allows us to celebrate our religion. And the reason why farming was founded in the Near East is for the longest time, there's an Ice Age. So you couldn't farm. You had to move around from place to place to hunt and find food. So after the Ice Age, which ended about 12,000 years ago, the climate became warmer and the Near East became the area where you could grow crops, the Aesias. So the Near East is what we call the Middle East today, which includes Turkey, Jordan, Syria, and Israel. That's where farming was invented. About 7,000, 8,000 years ago, the weather became a lot cooler. There was another ice age for a very short amount of time. And this forced people to start to immigrate or migrate to look for new land. So people in the Near East, they went off to Europe. And these people were very lucky because the geography Europe was not that different from the geography of the Near East. So they could take their religion, they could take their technology, move over to Europe and still be about the same. Okay, there are some minor changes but they were more or less the same. Okay, so these people were very lucky and these people as Maria Kumbutus said, these people have the same religion as the people of the in their east, they worship the mother goddess who gives life to everything, okay? They believe in the ideas of unity. Unity just means that we are the same, okay? Every one of us are the same. We have a responsibility to love each other and to love each other's children. We're the same as animals. We're the same as plants, okay? So we must do our best to protect nature. The farms allows us to eat food, but we should not destroy nature. We should protect nature because it's all the mother goddess, okay? We're all the children of the mother goddess. So we also believe in balance and harmony. And this is the religion, as we discussed before, of many indigenous peoples around the world. If you go to Africa, Australia, the Amazon, and you meet these indigenous peoples, They have the same religion, which is we come from a mother goddess and we have a responsibility to protect the nature, the earth, because that's the gift from the mother goddess. And everyone has a soul. So after we die, our soul still lives on. Does that make sense, guys? So this is the religion of old Europe. And because of this religion, it got a terrier, meaning there was no real difference between men and women. In fact, because women had the power to give birth, to give life, they were considered in many ways superior to men, and the political class was mainly governed by women. They were peaceful. They really didn't have to fight each other because they felt their resources was enough for them. And they were artistic. So they focused their intellectual energies on creating art to celebrate the mother goddess and their religion. So the people in the Near East and the people of Europe were very similar. The problem starts when these people went off to what we call the steppes. The steppes is a huge ocean of grassland that at least extends from Europe into Mongolia. And you know the Chinese word for this is tau yuan. Now the problem with the grassland is people can't eat grass. And you cannot grow crops on grassland that easily, okay? So the people and the steps, they struggle to survive. And the people and the steps engage in a process we call social evolution. OK? So you may have heard the term evolution. I want to explain what the term evolution means for our class, because we will refer to it a lot as we progress through human history. OK? So for us, evolution means open, cooperative, competition. OK? So this is what evolution means. And evolution has historically been the greatest source of human innovation and creativity. Okay? So let me explain why. Open means there's no central authority. There's no great power. Okay? There's no hegemon. Everyone's competing against each other. Competition just means these people, these many different people, They're trying to compete to survive. There are very scarce resources in the steps. It's not as wealthy as in Near East and as Europe. They're all trying to survive. They all adopt different strategies in order to survive. At the same time, cooperative means they're still communicating with each other. They're still trading. They're still friends. Maybe they'll exchange wives, exchange presents. So this is a process of social evolution that has created the most innovation in human history. So in Chinese history, this most resembles what appeared in Chinese history. In Chinese history, which part of Chinese history does this process where you have many different people in open competition with each other but still learning from each other. this period in Chinese history is called? Exactly, right? And that's where most of Chinese innovation and creativity came from, from that period. Confucius came from that period. Laozi, okay, a lot of major intellectual breakthroughs came from that period, okay? But not only the Tuntuo of China, as we move on, we will also look at two other major periods where there was a major helpers of innovation and then a very similar social structure as like this. So we will also be studying the Greek city-states. In fact, we'll spend a lot of time on the Greek city-states like Athens and Sparta and Thebes. Because before, we actually thought the origin of Western civilization were the Greek city-states. We no longer believe that, but for the longest time, we believe Western civilization came from the Greek city-states. And when you look at the Greek city-states, you'll discover the system they had back then is very similar to this system. We also look at the Sumerian city-states, which is very similar to the Greek city-states. Yes. So we'll be studying these different periods. But I want you to remember the first important principle is whenever there's an open, cooperative competition, tremendous innovation happens. That's the first principle I want you to remember. The second principle I want you to remember is eventually someone triumphs in this competition. And the people that triumphs are the people who are most open to adopting innovation in order to destroy others. Does that make sense? They are the most ruthless in adopting all innovations for the sole purpose of destroying others and becoming the sole hegemon. So we saw this with the Greek city states where for 100 years, they were in competition with each other. And then there was a people called the Macedonians, who weren't actually Greek, okay? They were marginal to the Greek city-states. And the Greek state really considered the Macedonians part of their civilization. But they were on the outskirts, and they observed all the innovations that the Greek city-states were creating, especially in terms of military innovation, adopted all innovations for their purposes and then conquered the city-states before they moved on and conquered Persia and Egypt. And the leader of the Macedonians was called, do you guys know? Who was the leader of the Macedonians who conquered the Greek city-states? I'm sure you know who he is, but you may not know he was a Macedonian. Who was the most famous Greek you've heard of? Yeah, he was actually a Macedonian. Max and Anna are great. And what's amazing is we see the same pattern play out with the Sumerian city-states, where for 100 years, the city-states were in competition with each other. They were all trying to conquer each other without success. And then an outside people, a neighbor called the Akkadians, the Akkadians, they adopted all the innovation and technology of the Sumerian city states, and then they conquer the Sumerian city states and establish the first great world empire called the Akkadian Empire. And the founder of the empire we will learn is called Sargon the Great. Okay? Sargon the Great. And Sargon the Great is considered the world's very first empire building. So even though we know almost nothing about what was happening here, from our knowledge of the Greek city-states and the Samaritan city-states and what happened to them, we can guess or hypothesize the same process played out here where these different tribes, these different groups were creating all sorts of different innovations. Then one outside group came in, adopted all the innovations and then conquered everyone, okay? So, and these people are what we call the Anaya who originate, we believe in Ukraine. So let's now discuss the innovations that these people created. And the innovations were pretty incredible because they forever transformed human history. So the first innovation they adopted was a pastoral economy, a pastoral economy, Basically, raising cattle, raising or herding cattle, or cows. All right. So we cannot eat grass, okay? But cows and sheep and goats can eat grass, and then we can eat the cows, the goats, and the sheep. Okay, does that make sense? So what we realize, what these people realize is they can take the cows, the goats and the sheep, from the farmers, okay, because there's a lot of trading back then, and then raise them in the steps, and because there's so much grass, they'll grow very fast, and then you can use that as the source of your food, okay? So they create a new economy. What the second innovation is, what then they realize is, you know what, we can also drink their milk, okay? Dairy. This is important because for most of human history, we cannot drink milk because we're lactose intolerant. In fact, most people in the world today are still lactose intolerant. But they develop the enzymes, the peptides, in order to drink milk. They became lactose tolerant. So that's their second big innovation, the ability to drink milk. And now, if you're able to eat protein and you drink milk a lot, what happens to your body? What happens to your body? Exactly, okay? You become very tall, very strong, okay? So because of these two innovations, the people in the steps were on average, okay? Just average 20 centimeters taller than the farmers in the Near East and in Europe. 20 centimeters is a lot, guys, okay? The reason why is the farmers did not eat meat mostly, and they could not drink milk. They ate vegetables. So the third big innovation is the domestication of the horse. The reason why is the grassland is huge and they needed to travel huge distances to trade, to communicate. So they started to domesticate the horse. And it's very hard to domesticate the horse because horses are trained, or horses are programmed, hard wire, to run away from humans, right? If they see a threat, they run away. So this process, we believe, took at least 3,000 years. Okay, but they kept on trying because the ability to ride horses was very important for their society and their economy. And so now they have the ability to ride horses. That's the third big innovation. Then they invent the wheel. And what this is important is if you have the horse and the wheel, you can create the wagon. If you have the wagon, it means you are no longer stuck in one place. You can move from place to place. And so this is what we call the nomadic pastoral economy. Doesn't make sense. They're able to move from place to place. Because basically what happens is you have a lot of cows, they're going to eat all the grass. Now you have to move somewhere else for them to eat the grass. Doesn't make sense. Now, the problem with this is what? If you move from place to place and the cows are eating all the grass, what happens? Usually. Conflict, right? Because you are now a competition for what we call grazing rights, grazing rights. If your cows go into a grassland and they eat all that grass, well, that's preventing other people from going in and having their cows eat that grass, okay? So now they're fighting over land and grazing rights, okay? What else are they now gonna fight over? How about cows, right? Because in this economy, one way to survive is to feed your cows. What's another way to survive? What else can you do in this economy, in this world? steal other people's cows, right? Does it make sense? Okay, so the protection of the cows meant there was a greater emphasis on men, okay? So remember in this society, in the Near East, in Europe, these are agricultural societies and for them what mattered was life giving, giving birth and maintaining a harmonious society. So women were more important. But in this society where there's a lot of violence, there's a lot of conflict, men became more important. So with these innovations, they start to change their economy, their society, and their religion. Economy, society, and religion. So in terms of the economy, the first major change from this society is the idea of private property. Private property, OK? Because cows are private wealth, and you have to protect that wealth, OK? So that's the first major innovation, the idea of private property where this belongs to you and only you and not to society or to the mother goddess, OK? And that's very different from the farmers in Europe who had no concept of private property. From the idea of private property, the society changes becomes a patriarchy, where men are in control. And then in a patriarchy of private property, the problem now is one of inheritance. So let's just say I have 10 sons and I have 100 cattle. And I die. Who gets my cattle? Who gets my wealth? It has to be the older son, why? The eldest son, why? Exactly, okay? So we need 100 cattle to survive as a family. If I start splitting the wealth up between the 10 sons, we become a lot poorer, right? The 10 sons have 10 sons, then by the third generation, everyone has one cattle. So everyone's now poor, okay? So the only way to solve this problem is if I, the patriarch, the father, give everything to the eldest son. And this is what we call primogeniture. So this is a new innovation, primogeniture, where the eldest inherits everything. Now the problem is what happens to the other nine sons. Exactly, OK? So the eldest son gets everything, and the nine other sons, too bad. You have to go build your own wealth. And that means basically stealing cows from other people. So this creates a war culture, a war culture. So does that make sense? That's your society. This is a society which honors men above women, which has private property and celebrates private property, which encourages young men to go out and expand the civilization and fight wars. So if you're making these changes, you now have to change the religion, the religion. So their religion makes major changes to the mother goddess religion. So the first major change is who's now God? Who do they now worship? A man, right? Because men fight wars. So they worship someone called the Sky Father. And he's the source of who the Greeks call Zeus, the Thunder God, okay? And who the Romans call Jupiter, also the Thunder God. So the first God is called the Sky Father, okay? That's the first change. The second change is, whereas the Mother God is, gave us everything, right? Nature. The sky father gave us cows, cattle, money and wealth. So the third change is, whereas the mother goddess asked us to love everything and protect everything, the sky father asked us to fight each other for the right to have wealth. Does it make sense? That's now their new religion. And so they adopt this new religion. Okay, so these are all major innovations, okay? And again, the one group who comes in adopts all these innovations are called the Yarnaya. And so if you're a group and you adopt most of these innovations, but not all these innovations, then you're gonna lose to the group called the Yarnaya who adopt all the innovations, okay? Does that make sense to you guys? This is what we call social evolution, okay? And when they adopt all these innovations, then what happens is their religion becomes aligned with the society, which becomes aligned with the economy. Okay? And so this is a people who are obsessed with collecting wealth and fighting wars and expanding into new territories. And so what happens is over a process of a few thousand years, they conquer the steps, okay? Their culture spreads throughout the steps. Doesn't mean they're one people. It means they're one culture. Practicing the same beliefs, okay? Doesn't make sense. Any questions so far? So these are the Yenai people. This is what they believe, this is where they came from, this is how they behave. Next thing I'm gonna look at is, fine. How do these people conquer Europe, okay? Now I already said, the Yenai are stronger and bigger and more militaristic than the farmers of old Europe. Right? What advantage do the people of Europe have over the Yama'a? What's the major advantage of Europe has? If you have farming, what happens to your population? It goes very fast, right? So in other words, Europe has more population than the steps. Does that make sense? Okay, so in theory, okay, well, yeah, the Yama'a, They have this war-like religion. They're extremely militaristic. They're very strong. But in theory, Europe could have stood the assault of the Amniya because Europe has more people. So the question now is, how did the Amniya conquer Europe? So what's a problem with people who live on farms? What's their ultimate problem? Thank you, the plague, okay, do you understand? Because you're living next to pigs and rats, and there's a lot of garbage around, okay? So it's very easy for diseases to spread, okay? So we believe two things happen to reduce the population of Europe significantly. The first thing that happened was the plague, okay? And this wiped out entire communities. Now the thing is though, the plague spread around the world. Because remember, what's important to remember is these people in the steppes, in the Near East, in Europe, were all in contact with each other. These are trading with each other. So the plague we know from DNA research was in Europe, the Near East, and the steppes. Why did it wipe out the population of Europe but not the population of the steps, even though the plague was everywhere. Why? The answer is, because the people in Europe were living in one place, right? Whereas the people of the steps were moving from place to place. Doesn't make sense. So even though the plague did impact the people in the steps, the impact was far greater in Europe. In fact, we believe that most of the people were wiped out by the plague in Europe, okay? So that reduces the population significantly. So that's the first thing that happened in Europe. Second thing that happened in Europe is what we call climate change. So about 4, sorry, yeah, about, let me do the math. About 5,000, 6,000 years ago, there was a mini ice age in Europe. And if you're a farmer, that's really bad for you, OK? Because you can't grow crops. And it's bad for you if you live in the steppes because a lot of your crops will die, but not as bad. And the other thing is that now the ice age, because of climate change, people in the steppes are now forced to expand further into Europe. So this is what we think happened. Three things that destroyed Europe. The first thing is the plague. That's actually the most important thing, because it wiped out most of the people. So think of when Europe conquered North and South America. What killed most people in North and South America was actually the plague, right? Europeans had these diseases, they brought over and that killed most of the local population. Okay, so the plague was the main culprit that destroyed all Europe. Then climate change, and then finally the United people who came into Europe and started to colonize Europe and destroy the local population. So let me now explain why the United decided to kill the farmers of Europe. So let's just say that in Europe, you have a village. Maybe 100 men, 100 women. You have 100 men, young men, who have no wealth and no wives, okay? So what do they want to do? If you're a young man, you have no wife, you have no wealth, what do you want to do? Yeah, you want to steal other people's wife and property, right? So they came in, okay? So, and what do they do? You have 100 men and 100 women in this village. So what do you do? No, yeah, but yeah, they kill the men, okay guys? And then they married all the women and that's what happened, okay? Now there are some circumstances when the MI came in. Because again, this is a culture. This is not one people. It's a culture of people. And they adopted different strategies. Some of them just had to come in and said, listen, we'll take all the women and we'll let the men go. And what do these men do? And return? And respond? What would you do? Yeah, so they went to get their neighbors, got a thousand of them, came back and killed everyone. OK? So this was actually a violent process with violence on both sides. But eventually what happened was the Amaya conquered all of Europe. And they even got to England. They conquered England. And then not only did they conquer Europe, then they went to conquer India and Iran. So this spread everywhere. And even Mongolia, OK? But not to China. Why did it impact China? What are the reasons why the United could not conquer China? What's between India and China? They conquered India, right? Why could they conquer China? You have horses, OK? You can't cross the Himalayas, OK? So that's what saved China, the geography. Also, China had a huge population, right? So even if the Yan-Nai came, the population could have repulsed the attack, okay? But China did not, was not conquered by the Yan-Nai. So China, for most of its history, was isolated from the rest of the world. Does that make sense? So, but this conquest meant, now there's a common language among all these people in India, in Iran, in the steppes, basically Russia, in the Near East, and in Europe. This language is what we call proto-Indo-European. That's the language they spoke. Now they have a common religion. So from this point on, this world, stretching from Europe all the way to India, was in constant communication with each other, with each other, trading ideas, people, and gods. And this is what we call today the West. And it's distinct from China, which was isolated from this world. Does that make sense? Any questions? The Mongolian people are descended from the Yemai, yes. And if you think about it, the Mongolian people are very similar to the Yemai, right? The Mongolians are also nomadic, pastoral people, who are also very much warlike, okay? And in fact, what we'll learn later on is that Genghis Khan adopted very similar policies as the Amnaya, okay? So we'll see a lot of similarities between Genghis Khan and his conquest and the Amnaya conquest of the world at this time, about 4,000 or 5,000 years ago. Yes? The plague, yes. It killed most Europeans, yes. Because Europeans were living on farms, right? So they were living together. Yeah, because it reduced the population of Europe, so they were less able to resist the invasion. Okay, all right. So the plague was all around the world, okay? And this is actually the bubonic plague, okay? The bubonic plague. It's spread by rats. And we have DNA of this plague, okay? So we know the Pneumatic plague has been with us for the longest time, okay? So the plague kills people who live closely together. You understand? Because then it's easier to transmit the disease. Okay? So if you live closely together, you're much more likely to catch the disease and die. Doesn't make sense. But if you live far apart, then you're less likely to catch the disease. So in Europe, people were living on farms. And there's like 10,000 people who might live on a farm. That's a lot of people who live very closely together. They're also living with animals, so it's very clean. But if you're living on steps, first of all, you're living far apart. That's the first thing. Second thing is your life is much more hygienic. because you're not living with pigs and rats. And the third thing is your body is a lot stronger, you're drinking milk, okay? You're getting a lot of physical exercise. Does that make sense? So these people are less likely to die from a plague. Any more questions? Exactly, yes. Okay. So basically, everyone in Europe, except for a few, few people, are the descendants of the Amnaya. The Indian people, the Iranian people also consider descendants of the Amaya. Now when the Amayyar came, these farmers in Europe, there were maybe three major responses. The first response is let's fight them and then they got killed. The second response is let's sort of cooperate with them. The third major response is let's move somewhere else. So the people who moved to islands, so for example there's an island called Sardinia, in Italy, it's an island, they survived against the Yamaya, and they have less Yamaya DNA than other people. But if you can't run off to an island, you're gonna get wiped out. But basically all of Europe was conquered by the Yamaya. And when you look at the data, later on I will show you the DNA evidence. When you look at that evidence, it's pretty stark, okay? All right? That's a great question, okay? Thank you. All right. So this process took a long time, 100 years, okay? And during this time, this is a spread of a culture. So it's not one people, it's not one nation. So what's happening was as they conquer different territories, They had to adapt themselves to that territory because the geography is different. So in the steps, you're leading a nomadic pastoral lifestyle. And at first, they tried that. So for example, we have evidence that in Norway, which is in North Europe, they burned down all the forests because they were trying to replicate their homeland. But then eventually they discovered, this is not going to work. It's too hard. So then they started to mix their lifestyle with the local lifestyle, and they became more focused on agriculture. Does that make sense? All right. And as the Ketan spreading, they also stole the technology of the local people. So even though the Yemtai people had no shipbuilding technology, they couldn't sell the seas, They were able to conquer people here off the coast who did have access to the sea and who did have boats. And then they stole the technology. They killed the people and they learned the technology. Once they had the technology, then they sailed off to England and killed everyone in England. Does that make sense? So it's a very slow process. And these are different groups of Yemnaya. But that's a very good question. Any more questions? Are you guys clear about this? Okay? All right. Absolutely clear? Okay, good. So when we come back from the break, okay, we will discuss the new world that this creates. Okay, because when you think of globalization, the Greeks, the Romans, well they all come from this world, okay? So basically what the Amniotic do is they create a new history for humanity. Before the Amnaya, humans were egalitarian, peaceful, and artistic. And now with the Amnaya, you have patriarchy. You have war. You have money. But before, we didn't have these concepts. So this marks a new history for humanity. When we come back from the brick, we'll start exploring this history. OK?"}

So let us do an overview of the history of the ancient Israelites Okay From about 1010 the year 1010 BCE until 586 This is what is referred to as the first temple period So remember the nation of Israel is created by King David and it's a coalition of different tribes, different cultures, different religions. And what makes this nation possible are two things. The first thing is the charisma of David. The second is the tremendous literary power and genius of the Yahweh. The individual who wrote the first stories of the Bible, Adam and Eve, the patriarchs, Moses. Okay? And what centers or unifies this nation is the first temple in Jerusalem. Remember to create centralized authority, David and Solomon, his son Solomon, they build a temple where everyone has to come in order to make sacrifices to Yahweh. So the first temple is the house of Yahweh. And at this point, there are certain characteristics about this new religion or this new nation. And again, I will have to oversimplify for the sake of clarity. So the first thing I would say about this new religion is it's polytheistic. It aspires to a monotheism. But it's only aspirational because the reality is it's a multi-cultural coalition. And people are going to believe what their fathers and their grandfathers believe. Okay? They may, and so people at this point have multiple faiths. And so the religion that we refer today as Judaism is only shared by the elite people. King David, his family and the priests and maybe other people in the elite. Okay? Second thing is, it is a monarchy. Okay? And the third thing is, this religion is an open, tolerant and optimistic religion. Because remember, the Bible, it's really the story of two people, Yahweh and David, an everlasting friendship that becomes the basis for the nation of Israel. I'll also remember that in the Yahweh's understanding of Yahweh, Yahweh is a poet God. He's fallible, he's sensitive, but he means good. He's willing to grow and help the Israelites grow as well. And in this religion to show faith to to Yahweh to show your devotion to Yahweh, you must argue with Him. You must learn and grow with Him as well. So this is a very open, confident, generous, and optimistic religion. By the time we reach the second temple period, from 539 to 70 CE, CE, okay? 539 BC to some CE. This is called the second temple period. Why? Because in 586, their temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, okay? By the time we reach this period, the Israelites are no longer referred to as Israelites, they're referred to as Jews. And the Jewish Jewish people, and the issue lies, they share the Bible, but in terms of culture and values, they're very different. So at this point, the Jewish people have become what we call Hino-theistic. The idea of Hino-theism is you believe there are gods, but your god is the best. God Yahweh is superior to all gods. And all the gods are false idols. They are deceivers. The second thing about the Second Temple period is it's very anti-monarchy, okay? And so it focused on the priesthood and the idea of ritual, religious ritual. So by the Second Temple period, the focus of power has shifted from the monarchy to the priesthood. And in a minute I'll explain why there was this change. Okay? The last thing for our purposes to understand about the culture is it's become extremely focused on purity. Okay? You can also say it is focused on fanaticism. It's a very close and conservative culture now. They believe their culture is the best and they believe it's important not to intermix with other cultures. So for example, Jewish women are explicitly forbidden to marry foreign men. And then from about 100 CE onwards, there's another transition to the religion. The reason And why is, remember, in the Second Temple period, religious worship is centered around the Second Temple. But in 70 CE, the Romans destroyed the temple and banished the Jews from Jerusalem. And so this makes massive changes to the religion after about 100 CE that carries it to the present day. The first thing is, it becomes fully monotheistic. They only believe there's only one God and that's it. Second is because there's no more temple and you can no longer make any sacrifices to Yahweh, the center of authority in this religion called Judaism are the rabbis. And rabbis means teachers. So the word for this period is called rabbinical Judaism. In other words, the Bible becomes the center of religious worship in Judaism before it was a temple. Now it's the Bible. It's the rabbis who interpret for you what the Bible means. The last thing about this is the idea of diaspora. Diaspora just means they are now spread out all around the world. They are no longer in Judaism. They're spread out all around the world. And as such, you'll have multiple strands of Judaism because their religion now has to interface with local culture and local customs. So this is a very broad overview of a thousand years of the history of the development of Judaism. As you can see, there are these massive cultural changes about every 500 years. And the reason why is the historical circumstance of the Israelites and the Jewish people change over time. Remember, the nation of Israel was founded as a historical accident. It was because of the Bronze Age collapse. Historically, the Levant was controlled by a superpower either in Anatolia or in Egypt or in Mesopotamia. But because of the Bronze Age collapse, the Hittites and the Egyptians have to retreat in the Levant, which gives space for a localized empire to emerge. And that's Israel. But over time, because the Levant was so strategically important, empires started to take over the Levant as a staging post for an invasion of Egypt. So what would happen over time is the Assyrians and the Babylonians would come and conquer Israel. Also, because the nation of Israel was multicultural and multilingual, it was only held together by the personal charisma of David. So when he died, it was very hard to hold the nation together. And when his son, some of them died in 9 to 31 BCE, the nation of Israel was about into two kingdoms, something called the Northern Kingdom of Israel and then Judah. The problem with this is the nation of Israel is centered around the religion. And the religion is centered around religious rituals in the temple. So in the temple was found in Jerusalem and Judah. So the people in Northern Kingdom had to make changes to religion, basically change the sites of religious worship. In 586, the Babylonians came and destroyed Judah and they burned the first temple. And the policy of the Babylonians was to capture the elite and hold them hostage in Babylonia and then send in a foreign delegation to control the territory. This is what it's called the Babylonian captivity. And while the issue rates are there, they're trying to hold on to the memory of who they are. Okay? There are two memories that sustain them in this period. The first is the memory of the greatness of King David, how they were once a united monarch under the leadership of David. So they're very proud of that. That's what sustains them. The other thing that sustains them is the Bible, the stories of the Yahweh's, Adam and Eve, the patriarchs. And because they are so focused on these memories, and because these memories are written down, they specialize, the Israelites specialize in intellectual activities. So in Babylon and elsewhere, they become very successful. They become administrators, they become teachers, they become intellectuals. And they, over this time, will also produce their own literature as a diaspora people to sustain them and to unify them. Also at this time, what's important to understand is the identity as Ishmaelite people becomes much more concrete and much more locked in. Before when they were back in Judea, in the Levant, their identity was very fluid. It was very open. It was very dynamic. But now that they are part of the diaspora, they have left Jerusalem, their identity becomes much more concrete. And the analogy would be, here in China, we use simplified Chinese. But guess what? When you go to overseas Chinese communities, like diaspora, right, in Southeast Asia, they all use traditional Chinese characters. they hold on to Chinese culture much more fanatically than in China. Does that make sense? So a very concrete identity emerges during the Babylon captivity. Also, what's important is they need to, if they are to survive as a people, they need to explain why this is happening to them. During the Davidic kingdom, they were at the height of their power. And the Bible was written at that time, and they believe that from now on, this kingdom of David will last forever. And that's what God promised. So why is it that the northern kingdom endured a split, and why were they conquered by the Assyrians and then the Babylonians? And why have they lost their land that God promised them? And the answer is because they broke their covenant with Yahweh. There's something called a covenant, a contract. If you, the Israelite people are loyal to me, meaning you only worship me, then Yahweh will protect you as my chosen people. So if Yahweh has abandoned us, it's because of three reasons. The first reason is because we start to worship foreign gods. That's the first reason. Second reason is because we start to have kings. And our religion does not allow kings because the authority of kings contradicts the authority of Yahweh. And the third reason is because we broke the Ten Commandments. because we continue to sin as a people. And the people who argue this are called the prophets. Okay? So after the first time of period, even the second time of period, the Jewish people adopt a prophetic tradition. They believe that Jewish people must remain peer to their love of God if they are to survive as a people. Okay? Okay, so, They are in Babylonian captivity for almost 70 years and then the Persians conquered the Babylonians. The Persians empire is really the first multinational empire in human history and their ruler, Sarsodgrade, he is known for being an extremely open, tolerant and generous ruler. So he releases the Jews from Babylon and have them return to Judaism where they will rebuild their temple called the Second Temple. And this starts the beginning of the Second Temple period. And the Jews are so grateful that such a great is called the Messiah in their Bible. Messiah means they anointed one, the one chosen by God to save the Jewish people. And Sarsigret is the only foreigner who is called Maesiah in the Bible. Sarsigret sponsors both the building of the Second Temple as well as in court to Jews to start the project that we now refer to as the Bible. And this was led by a priest named Eshra, who was part, who was in Babylon, but he returned to Jerusalem to rejuvenate their religion and to start the Bible. Okay, so that's the very brief overview of the history of the first thousand years of Judaism. Any questions so far? Are you guys clear about this? Okay, so what I will do now is I'm going to focus specifically on this period, okay? When Cyrus conquered Babylon and released the Jews to return to Jerusalem. Because this marks the fundamental shift in the religion. At this point, what will happen is the merger of the Persian religion with the Ashrite religion, which creates a new religion, okay? Now the religion of the persons is called Zoroastrianism. And the merge of these religions will become the basis of a new religion that will come to dominate the world called Christianity. OK, so to understand this history, I will have to first talk about the history of Mesopotamia. So as we discussed in class, the history of Mesopotamia is one of violent struggle. Because there are many violent people in this area. And this area is the center of the world, basically. It's where all the trade goes through. It's very wealthy. It's very multi-ethnic and multinational. So conflict and violence arises all the time. So you have over here a place called Arabia. And Arabia are nomadic people. And over here you have something called the Zagros Mountains. Up here is Anatolia, which is also very wealthy. And over here are the two rivers, okay? The Euphrates and the Tigris. And the city states are built along the two rivers. The people, the Domenic people in the desert of Arabia and the mountains of Zagros are opportunistic, okay? They will trade with you, but they also rage you and steal from you. Okay? They'll constantly be raiding and trading with the city-states. What keeps them in check is these city-states have walls. As well, these city-states will fight each other for dominance. Okay, because in Mesopotamia, the religion is people must fight for the honor and glory of their patron god. What keeps the city-states from destroying each other is they believe that each city-state, in each city-state, in a temple, lives a great god. So you can destroy the enemy's army in a battlefield, but you can't go and ransack the city in a temple because that would incur the wrath of the god. So there are these religious taboos that keep the system in check. And so for centuries, they've been funding each other and struggling against each other. And in this process of struggle, they will create many tremendous innovations that will forever change human history. For example, they create writing. They create many forms of knowledge, like mathematics and astronomy. So this is considered the cradle of civilization. This system broke down when a king named Luga Zaghezi of a city state called Uma. And Uma is always in conflict with a city state called Lagash. And Luga Zaghezi, he is so ambitious that he's willing to defy the gods. He decides, this is stupid. I keep on attacking my enemy, but I have to retreat after I win because I'm afraid of offending their god. Well, I'm going to test their god. I'm going to go into Lagash, destroy the temple, steal all their wealth, so I can fund other military adventures, and see if their god will seek revenge. So he's bringing the taboo. He's basically like the equivalent of using a nuclear weapon today. So he goes to Lagash and destroys Lagash, Burns on the temple, steals all their wealth, and nothing happens. In fact, he becomes even more successful, and he goes around and starts slowly and slowly conquering the city-states of Mesopotamia of Sumer, and he's about to unite all the entire region. And now the city-states are unified in their hatred of this person. He has defiled their temples. he has mocked their gods. This gives an opportunity for another warlord named Sargon of Akhir. And Sargon of Akhir is to determine to destroy Lugat Zagazi and restore the honor and glory of the gods of Mesopotamia. Why is he doing this? Because he himself has a legitimacy problem. He was a mercenary and he was part of the city-state of Kish. Okay? So he was supposed to be loyal to the king of Kish, but he was an extremely ambitious and charismatic soldier. So he did what David did and he usurped the throne. And so now this creates a legitimacy problem because remember in this religion, kings are descended from the gods. So now you, by using the throne, have offended the gods. So Sargon, his name means legitimate king by the way. Okay, legitimate king. Which tells us no one thought he was a legitimate, okay? He decides that he will create legitimacy by destroying Luka the Gacy. And he does that, okay? He destroys, like Luka the Gacy, He captures him, parades him around, and then kills him to show that he is favored by the gods. And by doing this, Saurgrin of Akkad unifies all of Mesopotamia, and he creates the first world empire called the Akkadian Empire. But also by doing this, by creating the first empire, Saurgrin of Akkad will now unleash a cycle of violence. Okay, and so over time, everyone will be forced to become more violent in order to maintain balance. It becomes an arms race of fear, terror, and violence. And empires rise and fall all the time. Okay, again, the problem with this area is you have extremely aggressive nations, and there are no natural boundaries to protect you. So even though it's very easy for you to pull an empire, it's also very easy for you to lose the empire. By 600 BCE, there are three major powers in this region. Over here in Anatolia, people call them the Lydians. Over here in Mesopotamia, are people called the Babylonians. And over here are the Medians. And these are three superpowers that check and balance each other out. They're powerful, but they're not powerful enough to destroy each other. Around this time will emerge a new power center called the Persians. They were led by a great king named Cyrus the Great. He is considered to be the greatest ruler in human history. Axon the Great saw him as a role model. When Axon the Great invaded Persia, and he saw that the tomb of the Great had been desecrated or abandoned, he was furious, and he stopped his campaign to make sure the tomb was renovated and returned towards former glory. If you go to Iran today, you can still visit the tomb of Sardis the Great, because throughout history, everyone had a higher opinion of him, okay? Even the Greeks thought he was fabulous. His own people, of course, loved him. So for the longest time before Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, he was considered the greatest ruler in human history, okay? So, but the problem is because we don't have access to writing, the writing, we have absolutely, we know very little about him, okay? Here's what we do know about him. He was in charge, he was king of a local people called the Persians, who of course are descended from the Yamaia, okay? So they use horse archers in their warfare. Over time, he's able to conquer the Medians. King Kroosius of the Lydians saw this as an opportunity to conquer the Medians as well. So he attacks, but Scythes the Great defeats him. So now Scythes the Great is in charge of two empires. What he does next is revolutionary in Mesopotamia. Instead of parading them around, like the Capric Kings around, and executing them like Sarkon of Icad, Scythe of the Great decides to make them advisors to his court. He shows mercy. He shows clemency. He shows forgiveness. And this shocks and auls the people of Mesopotamia. It shows Scythe of the Great is confident, is powerful, and is favored by the gods, because he is willing to show mercy to his enemies. But knowing that, what happens next is really interesting. The Babylonian Empire is the last empire in Mesopotamia. OK? If such a great wants to unify Mesopotamia, he has to conquer the Babylonians. At this time, the Babylonians have an internal conflict. The king and the nobility are getting along. The king wants to change the official god of Babylon from Marduk to sin, because the king wants to establish his own religious authority. So this creates tremendous conflict eternally in Babylon. And normally, they would go to civil war. And normally, when they hear that Sylas the Great has conquered the Medians and the Lydians, then they have to unify in order to defeat Sylas the Great. But they hear that Sylas the Great, he's merciful, and he's generous, and he's wise. So what they do is the nobility strikes a deal with Sylas the Great. And, science to great, Congress Babylonia without doing anything. And in the official history of science to great, he claims that the Congress of Babylonia was the greatest conquest, was his greatest conquest, because he did it through his generosity and his mercy, as opposed to killing lots and lots of people. And at this time, what science to great, And the person who's realized is, if you really want to control people, you have to use a policy called divide and rule. And the idea is this. Before these empires, the Acadians, the Syrians, the Babylonians, they believed that they used violence and fear to control people. When you do that, all you do is you anger people, unite them, and force them to rebel against you. But if you recognize that in each society, there are these natural factions who are in conflict with each other, and you're able to balance these factions, then they're relying on you for stability. Does that make sense? That's what we call divide and rule. So the Persians credit not an empire, but what we call a federation. In other words, a federation is the idea Like people choose to be part of this federation because it benefits them. Okay. Why does it benefit them? Because first of all, it brings peace. If there's a conflict, you don't fight each other. You go to the Persians for a conflict resolution. Okay. So it brings peace. Second of all, it brings prosperity through trade. Okay. So the persons create all these roads that enable trade within the empire. And so you're better off actually trading than you are fighting. And third of all, you're able to access new knowledge and culture through this process. So the persons will first create a national imperial postal system. It was very, very clever. So all they did was they set up checkpoints throughout the empire. And these checkpoints, they were like hotels for postmen. They had food, they had new clothing, they had a place to sleep. These postmen would, on their horses, carry mail throughout the empire and stop at these checkpoints to rest. Okay? So the Persians showed that by participating in this empire, you could benefit a lot more than if you didn't participate and therefore you should participate. And so it's an amazing achievement because remember, these nations were at war with each other throughout their history. And these are very aggressive people with lots of religious differences. And Saraswati Great and his descendants were able to create a system that allowed them to work together and prosper together. And that's why he is remembered today. today, that's a great, is remembered today as the greatest rule of all time, okay? In human history, no one comes second. And also, while the Jews refer to him as Messiah, the God, God's chosen, God's anointed, a man picked by God to come to save the human people, the human race. So with this federation, with this empire, what's important is the idea of administration, okay? Administration. You need administrators who will be conscientious and loyal and good people, okay? Because remember, they are working with local governors. So each region is allowed local autonomy and each governor is called a satrap. So they are working with the satraps to govern the local area. And remember, these satraps are allowed maximum autonomy and freedom to do what they believe. is allowed to practice their own religion. So what the administrations are doing is ensuring divided rule, right? That there's enough internal conflict within this region so that they're all dependent on the empire for guidance and authority. These administrations have to be, have to be, they can't get into bed with the Satyaps. They can't be cropped together, because the system will break down. So there had to be a system to keep the administrators loyal to the empire. And this system is a religion called Zoroastrianism. Okay, Zoroastrianism. And this is the religion of the Persian people. And this is the religion of the Imperial administration. If you want to be a bureaucrat within this system, you have to believe in Zoroastrianism. You have to participate in the rituals and the rites of Zoroastrianism. And what made the system work is Zoroastrianism was at this time, 600 BCE, 500 BCE, the best religion in the world. So this is a new concept for us, the best religion in the world. We've discussed the best military in the world, right? The best military in the world has three characteristics. Discipline, they fight a lot. They have a lot of experience. They like each other, they get along, and devotion. They have a common purpose, they have a great leader that they love. Okay? It turns out religions can also be measured. And there are certain religions that are better than other religions based on three criteria. Okay? These three criteria are grandness, completeness, and unity. Okay? Grandness, completeness, and unity. And this is not a hard concept. So think of religion as a story and ask yourself, what makes a good story? What makes a story so wonderful you want to hear it? And it's these three things. Grandness, it's a big topic. Kings and gods and wars and love, okay? Completeness, there's a beginning and there's an end. And unity, there's a plot. Things are united, okay? So if I were to tell you a story about Gilgamesh, who's a king who fought these gods in a search for immortality, and in the end he discovers immortality's impossible, well that's a complete unified and grand story. And you wouldn't want to hear that story. But if I would tell you a story about a guy named Robert who wants to get AIDS in school, and so he studies all the time, you don't want to hear the story, okay? It's not grand, it's very boring, it's not complete, there's no ending, it's not really unified because something really happens. Does that make sense? It's the same with religions. The problem with most religions is the structure. So the typical religion is a three-tier structure. So at the center are gods. And gods are the ones who participate in human affairs. They're the ones manipulating us. But there's also a higher tier that governs the gods as well. These are cosmic forces like fate and fortune. And then the highest here are these invisible laws of the universe that give it structure. What is referred to as the immutable and unwritten laws of the cosmos. And this is what the Greeks believed. This is what the Romans believed. And as you can see, this system, it's not complete. It's not unified. It may be grand, but it's not complete or unified. It's a very loose system. Zoroastronism is the first really grand, complete, unified religion. So let's talk about Zoroastronism. So in the religion, they believe there is a creator, God, called the Ahura Masta. And he is the God of creation. He's the God of light. He's the God of order. And he creates a perfect world, perfection. And within this world, we humans are created. But then there is an evil presence, an evil God, which comes and corrupts the perfection. And this evil, our darkness, is a match for the Creator God. So the world is a perfect balance of dark and light. What tips and balance is the human race. We have free will. Therefore we can choose to fight for goodness or to fight for darkness. To fight for the truth or to fight for the lie. So the two main, the economy is truth and lie. You fight for the truth, you're making the world a better place. But if I for the lie, you are corrupting the world. So that's our choice. Eventually, a savior, a hero, will arise to prepare for the final battle between dark and light. In this final battle, light will triumph. Once light triumphs, a river will emerge. River will emerge. And everyone must cross this river. Everyone will arise from the dead and everyone has to cross the river. If you have been good, if you have fought for the truth, you will cross this river and it will cleanse you. You will feel purified. You will become an eternal soul who will live in paradise forever. We'll return to perfection, okay? But if in your life you have lived a lie, if you have committed evil, If you have done wrong against other people, then you will burn in the river, and you will be condemned to hell for the rest of your life. Okay? And this is the idea of what we call eschatology. Eschatology. Yeah, okay, so this is a hard word, eschatology, but I need you guys to remember it, because it's a very important word. Eschatology means an understanding of how the world ends. And zoroastronism is the first eschatological religion. It has an ending, a final battle, good versus evil, where everyone will be judged, okay? And so now we understand why the Persian system works. Because if you are to be an administrator, if you are to work for the empire, and you believe in Jurassicism, then you have a duty to fight for the truth, okay? We're here at most for 60, 80 years. And what we do in these 60, 80 years, will decide how we live our lives for all of eternity. We either live in paradise or we'll burn in hell, depending on how we perform these 60 to 80 years. So the persons are under tremendous pressure to be a good person. This is radical in the history of humanity. So remember, mesopotamians believe you are good if you achieve, right? How do you know you're good? because you've achieved a lot. And by achieving a lot, you show that God's favor you. And he just is believed in status. And others believed in just good luck. But the persons believe you have to be a good person. You have to show generosity, compassion, and mercy to others as exemplify by the life and works and words of Cyrus the Great. So that's your racism. And this is so powerful that it will be adopted into Judaism and eventually become the basis for Christianity. But this is where it started, Zoroastrianism. Any questions so far before I continue? Are you guys clear about what's happening? OK, that's a good question. If this is the best religion, what are the worst ones? You're right. There's really no bad religion. But the most common religion is folklore religions. So you live in a village and you believe in a local God. Does that make sense? And so when I say it's best, what I mean is intellectually, it's the best. It's a religion that can attract the best and the brightest. Do you understand? It's a religion where if you are a very intelligent person, you are attracted to this religion. Does that make sense? But if you are just a normal person, you're just going to believe what your father and your grandfather believed. So think of this religion almost as the equivalent of the Confucian classics in China. How do you show cultivation in China by reading the Confucian classics? And if you want to become a scholar official, you have to memorize the Confucian classics, right? The same concept here, where Zoroastrianism, you have to believe in this religion if you want to become an administrator. And the problem with this religion that makes it hard for people to understand is it's very abstract. That's the main failing of this religion. It's very abstract. It's very intellectual. And that's why a lot of people don't really see this as a religion and more as a philosophy. And what's also important for us to understand is the abstraction is what makes this religion appealing. Because the Persians are trying to attract the best and brightest for their administration. So they don't want a popular religion. They're not trying to promote their religion. They're trying to use their religion to filter out the best and the brightest. Does that make sense? So you're right. I can't say this is the best religion, but it's the religion that is the most intellectual and which will attract the best administrators in the Persian Empire. And that's why it's effective. Great question. Any more questions? Yes? OK. So the completeness is eschatology, OK? And ending. Because most really just don't actually have an ending. They don't have, they're not like, OK, this is when the world ends. OK? So for example, King David, the Bible, right? It's telling us that King David is really the end of history. And from now on, we will live forever in this Davidic kingdom. This is the best we can do. But it's not saying, OK, King David, we will eventually reach a point when the world ends, and when God returns to the earth. No religion is doing that before Zoroastrianism. Does that make sense? So think of completeness as a circle. Because if you look at Zoroastrianism, they say this is a perfection. But now there's corruption. So the story ends when corruption ends and we return to perfection. So the circle closes. Does that make sense? The same with the Bible where we start out in the Garden of Eden and then we are forced out of the Garden of Eden, right? But no one doesn't say we'll return to the Garden of Eden. But when we reach Christianity, that's what will happen. Jesus will promise of the return to the Garden of Eden. So now the circle closes. Does that make sense? Any more questions? All right, let's continue. So we have this religion, Zoroastrianism. And eventually, the Jews will adopt it into their own religion. And we have Sassar Great, who is this wise, generous, and merciful leader. But he is this way because he is strategic. strategic. So when he allows the Jews to return to Jerusalem, he's doing so for strategic purposes. Okay? He's not doing it because he feels sorry for the Jews. He's doing it because there's a certain strategic purpose in allowing them to return to Jerusalem. And the reason why is Jerusalem, as we discussed, is very important geographically, it marks access into Egypt, which is what starts the Great Eventually Once I Conquer, because Egypt is the wealthiest nation in the world at this time. So he needs to bring stability to the Levant. And in the Persian worldview, what creates stability is the balancing of forces within the local area. Okay? So he needs to create conflict in the Levant. At this point in and the Levant, there are still Isrealites living there. And they are now called the Samaritans. And then you have the Jews. The Jews is a Persian word. It means people who live in the problems of Judea, which is a Persian province. So they're called Jews now, and not Isrealites. Isrealites are now called Samaritans. These come from the same people. But the difference is this. These Israelites who stay have adapted to new circumstances. And so what this means is they still practice their religion, but they've also intermarried with women of different faiths. So now it's coming for a household to practice many different faiths. Whereas the Jews in Babylon, they're more fanatical. They believe it's important to practice only one faith. So when Psyrus the Great sends the Jews back to the Levant, this immediately creates conflict between the Samaritans, who believe they are the true descendants of the Israelites, and the Jews, who believe they are the true descendants of the Israelites. So this creates religious conflict in the Levant, which means the Persians are able to become the Arbiter. And this creates the Valiant Rule. Now, what's important for us to understand is the Jews who return to the Samaritans are only the most fanatical Jews. There's only minority people. The rest of the Jews are perfectly happy in Mesopotamia. They have very successful careers as administrators, as intellectuals, as teachers. They're happy where they are. So it's only the most religious extremists who return. And they are in the minority. So the Samaritans are in the majority. So the purists support the Jews who have returned in trying to create purity, okay? So the Jews argue for purity, the Samaritans argue for tolerance. And so this is a power struggle, a religious power struggle. In 443 BCE around then, a priest, a Jewish priest named Ezra, he returns to Jerusalem needs to determine to win this war. So there are certain things he does. The first thing he does that is extremely controversial is he announces, if you are a Jewish man, you must divorce a foreign woman. If you're married to a foreign woman, meaning a woman who doesn't share our faith, then you must divorce her in order to maintain the purity of our people. He also announces that from now on, It is mandatory for Jewish men to observe religious rituals, to go to the temple and make your sacrifice. Okay, so he's trying to stop his purity. But his main contribution, which is the most important, is he wants to unify the Jewish people into one faction, okay? So let me explain why this is important. So as we discussed, there are multiple Bibles out there. And so there's at least four different schools or four different strands. There is the House of David School called the Yahweh's, right? The Yahweh's, or J. Remember, this is the idea of the Yahweh's that the Yahweh, he is a fallible, good meaning, well-meaning poet. But the main point of the Yahweh is God has chosen David to be the legitimate ruler of Israel. God has also ordained David to build the temple where God will reside. Okay, so this is to legitimize the thought of David and to make you understand the central authority of this religion is the temple in Jerusalem. But as we discussed, Eventually, the northern kingdom will break away from Judah. But once you break away, you can't access Jerusalem anymore. So now you have to have other sites where you can practice your religious rituals. But you do that, you have to change the Yahweh manuscript. And so they do that and create new mythologies. And this is what's called the E manuscript for Elohim. Elohim is just a different word for God. Does that make sense? So you actually have two competing Bibles. At the same time, you have the priestly manuals. So remember, today is about this point. It is a religion focused on ritual, like most religions. So you need manuals in order to tell you why you're doing this ritual and how you should do these rituals. They have to be very precise. They have to be effective. At the same time, as the Novi kingdom fell, as Judah was conquered by the Babylonians, as the Jews are forced into captivity, you have to explain why this is happening. And while this is happening, most people choose to not follow religion anymore. They adopt a new religion or they move somewhere else. But the religious fanatics have to explain why this is happening. And the explanation is because the Israelites continue to disobey God. And this faction, which is basically looking at Jewish history and explaining what is happening, is called the Deuteronomus, the D-Score, the Deuteronomus. So these are four major factions. Do you understand? And these are four different Bibles. Now what it actually wants to do is put all these four Bibles together to create the impression of a unified religion and a unified people. And the way he does that, which is very interesting, is he basically just takes different parts from each of these books and puts them together. And now this is the Bible. And that's why if you actually read the Bible, you'll find it completely unreadable. But he also makes changes to the Bible, which is very important. Before, the most important person was David, okay? Because he's really the founder of the nation of Israel. He's the founder of religion. Now, the most important person is Moses. Because Moses is a priest. He's the one who was given the laws by Yahweh. Okay, so there are other changes as well, but this is the most important, okay? There are other changes that will come over time as Zoroastrianism merges into Judaism. So there are three major changes. The first is the idea of eschatology, meaning there will be an endpoint to history. And the endpoint of history is when the entire world, when all the empires of the world, because they defy God, converge against the nation of Israel in one final battle. And in this battle, of course, Israel will win, and this will create eternal peace in the world. Because God has chosen Israel as his people. Second big idea is good versus evil. Before the religion of Judaism was very personal. Good and evil was in you. But now there is actually good and evil. Israel stands for good. These other nations, these other empires, like the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, they represent evil. And the third change, which is the most important is there'll be a hero who will come to lead the nation of Israel against all its enemies, and he is called the Messiah, the son of man, the son of man. And he will come from the house of David as written in the Bible. And why is this important? because the Christians believe the Messiah is Jesus. So the Christians basically take all this, this merger of Zoroastrianism with Judaism, and their claim is the Messiah is Jesus. And this creates Christianity, which we will discuss next class. Any questions so far? Are you guys clear about all this? Excuse me? Okay. Yeah, okay, thanks. Thank you, okay, okay, all right. So let me explain what's happening, okay? So remember the Babylonians in 586, they take over Jerusalem. They burn a temple. They destroy the religion of the Jews. They take the elite of a few thousand people. They move them to Babylonia, okay? And but what's, who's left behind are the majority of Israelites. But now they have to adapt to a new elite. And so they preserve their religion. They also adopt the religion of the elite, who are the Babylonians. You also have Israelites who go off to Egypt. So now you create something called a diaspora. They're either in Babylon or they're in Egypt. But the majority are still at home in Judea. And in this time, because these are just ordinary people, they will adopt many faiths. It's very common back then for a person to have multiple faiths. The faiths of your father, the faiths of your mother, the faith of your wife, the faith of your neighbor. Because this is how people got along. If you said that my God is better than your God, you will piss off your neighbor. You will piss off your colleague. Why would you do that? So it's very common back then for people to have multiple faiths, a faith you might practice at home, a faith you might share with your friends, a faith you might have to share with your king. Does that make sense? So these are extremely multi-religious people. And as we discussed, when the Israelites are forced to go to Babylon, they are forced to have a more fanatical religion in order to maintain their identity. It's like how do you separate yourself from these other people? Because if you don't do that, What happens is you become assimilated, right? You lose what it means to be Israelite. And quite honestly, most people chose to be assimilated because that was the easiest thing to do. But there's a fanatical minority, mainly priests, who are determined to keep alive their religion. Because only by keeping alive their religion could they keep alive Yahweh. Could they keep alive Israel? OK? So when these Jews were allowed to return to Judea, they were horrified by the corruption and purity they saw. They were like, we're in Babylon. And for 70 years, we fought hard to save our religion, to maintain the purity of our religion. They go back, and they see their people in Samaritans now adopt foreign gods. And they were like, this is why we fail as a people. This is why Yahweh punished us, because we refuse to be loyal. So what they're thinking is like, I would rather all these people go away than to have them stay around. You understand? We don't want to get a law. We want to maintain the purity of a religion, because that's the only way to save our people. And that's why they say, hey, if you're going to stay, You have to divorce your wife, who is a foreigner. If you don't want to do so, go away, man. The Persian Empire is huge. Go somewhere else. But Jerusalem is only the land of the peer. Does that make sense? So I know this is a controversial idea, but it's really only the extremists who keep the religion alive. This is true for all religions. Does that make sense? It's only people who are most willing to die for the religion that keeps the religion alive. If everyone's willing to compromise, the religion dies very quickly. And the Jewish religion, Judaism, is able to stay alive for 3,000 years because there are lots of people in the religion, a minority, but still a lot of people who are willing to die for the religion. There's something we'll discuss later on this semester. So thanks for the question. Any more questions? Okay, so next class, we will discuss the rise of Christianity. Jesus, basically."}
{"video_id": "Jjqf9T59uY0", "title": "Civilization #1:  Explaining Humanity's Transition to Agriculture", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjqf9T59uY0", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 3149.5963125, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 6531, "text": "Okay, so in this first lecture, I want to ask a question. The question is, why did humanity transition from hunter-gathered society to agriculture? Okay, and in the traditional paradigm, a paradigm. Paradigm is a very sophisticated English word English word and all it means is story or model or understanding okay. So in a traditional story paradigm we transitioned because we're first hunter gatherers and we lived in groups of about 20 to 50 people and we roam the land looking for food. It was uncertain, it was unstable and then suddenly there's revolution. We discover farming and farming provided a stable source of food that we could control. Okay? The word we use is domestication. Domestication just means that we bring it under our control. And because of farming we can now create more food than we need. The word we use for this is surplus. And because First there was a surplus, people now could do things besides farming. So for example, we could have leaders, which creates the idea of politics, right? We could also have priests, which introduces the idea of religion. And then we could have creative people, which then gives us arts. And slowly over time, these villages grew into cities. And because there was a lot of people in our surplus, we could now have literature, reading and writing. So we can now store knowledge and then pass it from generation to generation and across cultures. We can now have science and technology. And slowly over the course of this process, we create modernity, which is the world that we live in today. So the pivotal step towards modernity what's this transition into our culture. And this is traditionally what we believed about the world. Unfortunately, there's no evidence for this, okay? And in fact, the more evidence we collect, the more we realize this is not true. In fact, what we now know is it was actually pretty stupid to transition from hunter-gatherer into farming, okay? For a variety of reasons. The first reason is that when you're a hunter-gatherer, it's actually a pretty easy life because there's food everywhere, okay? When you're a farmer, it's a hard life because you have to grow that food. So maybe as a hunter-gatherer, you're working maybe an hour a day, but as a farmer, you're working six, seven hours a day. It was very hard to grow that food. So in the book, Sapiens, the Israeli historian named Yuel Harari, he's very famous. Sapiens also very famous book. There's a very famous sentence. The sentence is like this. We did not domesticate wheat. Wheat domesticated us. So we thought that we made wheat. the food wheat into our slave. But in reality, wheat made us its slave. And the reasoning for this is this. Out in nature, if you're wheat and you want to survive, you have to make yourself attractive to other people and to animals. So you have to be tasty. And you have to be easy to find. You have to do a lot of work. But when you're on a farm in your wheat, You can just lay back, do nothing, and make humans do all the work. Okay? So it was a bad deal for humans and a very good deal for wheat. Okay? So that's the first problem. You actually do more work on the farm than you do as a hunter-gatherer. Which means that now you have to have more children, right? You need to have labor to do all that work, which creates a problem of overpopulation. Which means that you are using too much land, And then eventually, the land becomes dead, okay? Or not airborne anymore. So it's the first problem. Second problem is that we're able to take up the skeletons of hunter-gatherers and farmers. And what we see is that hunter-gatherers are a lot taller than farmers. Why? Protein, right? Food. As a hunter-gatherer, you have access to meat. You have access to fruits and nuts and vegetables. Your diet is very and very nutritious. But as a farmer, you're eating only what you grow, which is mainly wheat and some vegetables. So you're not getting that much nutrition. Then the third problem is that as a farmer, you were much more likely to die early than if you're a hunter gatherer. Why? Have you guys been to a farm? What's the problem on a farm? Exactly. Thank you. Pigs, right? Animals. They're everywhere. Plus, where do you put the garbage? Where do you go to the restroom? Right? So because people are together in a very unclean place, it's much more likely to contract disease and and die. So for these three reasons, the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming makes no sense. And even today, we are not able to explain to you why this transition happened. We don't know why we did this. So the only thing we can do is construct theories as to why this might have happened. So even though we can't go in the past and look at why we did this, we can do some research and collect evidence and then create theories as to why this might have happened. So there are four different disciplines from which we can collect evidence. The first discipline is called archaeology. Archaeology is just the study of the past. So basically you go and you take stuff off and you see what you can find. Maybe you can think of someone's house, or you can think of someone's skeleton, or someone's clothing. And from that, you're able to figure out what happened in the past. And so three pieces of evidence from archaeology we will look at today are Gobiakitepae, Jericho, and Kataya Hoek. And these are places that we've actually dug up, we know what life is like in these three places. So that's archaeology. Second discipline we can look at is anthropology. And anthropology is the study of other cultures. So in other words, there are places still on this planet where people live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Maybe in the Amazon, maybe in Australia, maybe in Africa, okay? And so we're able to go and study these people to understand why, how originally we thought and why we might have transitioned into farming. Okay. So anthropology. The third field that we can look at is psychology or neuroscience. Basically how the brain works. How do we feel? What motivates us? Why do we behave the way we behave? Okay. So that's a third field we can look at. The last field we can look at is primatology, a study of primates, okay, or monkeys. Because guess what guys, we're monkeys, we're primates. 99% of our DNA are monkey DNA. So we can look at certain groups of monkeys to understand how they behave. And there are three types of primates that we look at very closely, okay. The first is gorillas. We also look at chimpanzees. And we look at Bono voles, okay? Chemperties and Bono voles are very close to us. Genetically, they're the closest to us of all the primates. So by looking at these four different fields, we're able to collect evidence to construct theories as to why we transitioned from hunter-gatherer into farming, okay? So now I will share some of these theories with you. And again, what's really important to understand is we don't know what happened. We can only guess about what happened. So the first theory is the idea of coercion. And what this basically means is that there's an elite group of people who didn't want to work. So they made everyone else work. So that's coercion. And the evidence for this is that, well, guess what? Gorillas do this, right? If you study gorillas, you will see that they always have an alpha male, the male who's bigger than everyone else and who makes everyone do all the work. He just sits and naps every day, but he gets all the girls and he gets all the food. So gorillas, that's the first theory. The second theory is war. And the idea here is that if you are on a farm, it's easier to protect yourself in the time of war than if you're out in the forest. You can build walls around your farm. You can defend yourself a lot easier. You can see the enemy coming. So war. The evidence for this is that chimpanzees, again, who are like us, they go to war a lot. They're very violent. They're always fighting each other. So the argument here is that we human beings are just a violent people who are always at war and we must be afraid of each other. And therefore, when we have the chance, we'll settle down, build fortifications, build walls and fight each other, okay? That's the second theory. And again, the evidence for this are chimpanzees. The third theory is respect for elders, meaning that as a hunter-gatherer, it's very hard on old people, right? So at a certain point, you're going to have to leave the old people to just stay there and die. And maybe we as human beings, we are biologically programmed to take care of elders for whatever reason, okay? And again, the evidence for this is anthropology, where every culture respects its elders, right? So that's a third theory. The last theory is religion, okay? Meaning that we settle down in order to celebrate a religion, to practice a religion. And just to be clear, there's evidence and arguments for all four theories, and there are scholars who argued for different theories. But the consensus, what most people agree on today, most scholars, not every scholar, but most scholars is religion. So let me explain why we think the answer has to be religion slowly. OK. So portion. While it is true that with gorillas, There's an alpha male who controls everything. The problem is that if you look at gorillas, the alpha male is huge, okay? And males are a lot bigger than females. So it's possible for one gorilla to exert force and pressure on the others, okay? With human beings, that's harder, right? Because let's just say a nine foot giant human being comes into this room and it's like, I'm now your boss. You have to go food for me. You have to give me all your woman. What can we do as a class? Beat the crap out of him, okay? You understand? Because we have big brains and these big brains allow us to cooperate together, okay? So this guy's around and at first we're afraid of him so we let him do whatever he wants But then he goes to bed and then we have to class discuss, hey, what can we do? Well, we can make weapons, right? Or we can trap him or we can trick him. We can give him poison food, okay? So, coercion among humans is very, very hard to do. The worst case scenario, we can't feed him up. What we'll do is just run away, okay? Does that make sense? So we don't think coercion is an explanation because there's so many ways for us to fight back and to rebel against bigger people. Okay. So, coercion doesn't really work. War. Okay. So we don't think war is a good explanation either. So it is true that chimpanzees are naturally violent, okay? They're always being a crap at each other. But guess what? Bonobos who are actually closer to us genetically than chimpanzees, they're actually very peaceful. They don't fight each other, okay? So there's no evidence that we human beings are naturally violent. Also, if it is war, then we should be able to find weapons. And we don't really find weapons. In archaeology, we don't really find weapons of early humans. Now, there is a lot of violence in early human history. There's human sacrifice. There's group burials where a group of people are killed. But that's basically violence within a group. We don't find evidence of large violence among different groups, okay? We don't find that. So war, we don't really think it's a possibility. Now, it's possible that in the future, we'll find evidence. But I'm just saying that right now, in archeology and anthropology, we do not have any evidence, okay? The last, then we look at respect for elders. And even though this is a valid theory, there's an argument that back then they didn't really care about dying that much. The reason why is that for most of human history, we human beings have seen life history as a circle. So for example, right now it's summer. going to turn into fall, then winter, then spring, then summer again. Okay? So the world history moves in a cycle. Well, human life also moves in a cycle. You're born, you die, then you're reborn, then you die again, then you're reborn again. Okay? So back then they really didn't care if you died. In fact, if you're an old person, you're probably like, you know what? I'd rather be dead. And then, so if I die, I'll either be reborn or go into the spirit world, okay? So they didn't really fear death or they really didn't see death like the way we saw death, yeah? Okay, that's a great question, okay? So the evidence for this is what we understand about their religion, which we will discuss later on and in next class, okay? All right, the last, so that leaves religion as the most likely possibility. And again, this is what most scholars believe happened. And so we're gonna look at three different archeological sites. The first is Gopalaya Tepe. The second is Jericho. And the third is Katahoyak, okay? All right. So I'm gonna draw up a, I will first see a picture of Gopalaya Tepe. And guys, these places were only discovered in the past few decades, okay? So these are new places. We're only starting to understand these places. And so this place is in Turkey, in Central Turkey, and this dates back about 9,500 BC. So this is about over 11,000 years old. And we don't even think this is the oldest place, okay? So if you did your research, you will know that this is basically a place of religious worship. You can see that they constructed this place so that there are these T-shaped pillars. And these things are huge, right? This is a human being and this is a T-shaped pillar. We think, again, this is all theory. This is all what we know. We don't know that much because this is all recent. But we think that these T-shapes represent human beings. human beings. And within these t-shapes are animals. And you can see that they align or they build this t-shape in a way that they can practice a ritual or a worship. So the people who are leading this were probably who we call shamans or religious leaders that help us bridge our world with the animal world and the spirit world. So these are shamans. And so, Gobertepe is a place of religious worship. Now what's interesting about Gobertepe is that the religious site is the oldest, but we also find houses that are built later on. So what we think might have happened here is that hunter-gatherers will come to a place now and then to practice religion. Because ultimately, as human beings, and we discussed this last class, we have a yearning, or we have a need to understand why. And religion solves this problem for us. Also, as hunter-gatherer, you need to associate with other hunter-gatherers in order to find mates, to find husbands and wives to reproduce. And so this sort of religious center, it's a great time to come and practice religion, but it's also a great time to feast and to meet someone you can marry and have children with. So that was the original function of the temple. Now these places are often led by shamans. And what makes them special is that they are charismatic leaders. Charismatic leaders. Charismatic leaders are people like Mao Zedong, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton. They're people who for their reason, people just love them and want to follow them. And so maybe what happened was that these charismatic leaders, they built this place and they became like celebrities. And people came from all over to meet them, to hear the religion, and to meet other people. And over time, some people even chose to stay with them and build houses to celebrate them, okay? And then when they died, what happened was they still worshiped them in their death. And so this place became a temple. Does that make sense? So that's one theory about Goblet-Tetple. There are other theories. There are some people who will tell you that space aliens came down and built this place because it's so sophisticated. So there are different theories, but the one that scholars most agree with today is that it was a religious center. Any questions before I move on? Okay, so that's a great question, okay? Where does religion come from? And this is something that we will look at very closely in the next class. And the answer is this, okay? Even though we all have the need for religion, we don't all have the ability to produce religion, okay? So who these charismatic leaders are, are people who have visions or dreams of God God or the spirit world, okay? And then they present their visions to other people. And we have people like this throughout human history, right? So think of Jesus, think of Muhammad, think of Buddha, think of Confucius, right? These are people who have these visions of God or of spirituality or of a new world and present to people. And because they're charismatic, they're able to track followers and spread their religion. And that's what probably happened here as well. Because as you can see from this picture, it was very hard work to build this temple. This is 11,000 years ago. They didn't have bulldozers. They didn't have shovels. This is all by hand. So for them to want to dedicate their lives to building this temple, because they It took a long, long time, right? It took years and years and hundreds of people. Well, you needed something called religious devotion, right? Faith. Does that make sense? Okay, and again, throughout human history, we've seen this, right? So think of Christians, think of Buddhists, think of Muslims, religious faith. So that's what built this. Okay, so does that answer your question? Okay, any more questions before I continue? Yeah? Okay, so that's a good question. Why is a temple structured like this? Okay, and the answer is that there's cosmological significance to the structure, meaning that on a certain time of the year what will happen is that the sun will hit this place in a certain way. So it's almost like a clock. Does that make sense to you guys? They designed this in a way so they can tell time. But their intention was not to tell time. Their intention was to connect with the outer world. Does that make sense to you guys? So they were extremely sophisticated. They knew a lot about the way the stars worked. So basically for them, this is science. Today we say this is a religion. But there's science back then is no different from our science today. Does that answer your question? Okay, and you had a question? Okay, so if you talk to any religious people, they saw it, okay? They were there, they talked to God, right? So we're like, well, that doesn't make any sense, but they really believe it, and that's why they're able to convince their followers. Okay, so you go back, so in the future, we will look at someone like Mohammed, who had religious visions in a cave. And you're like, did he really see an angel? Well, he thought he really did. Okay? And in fact, if we, in our research, what we discovered is that people who use, who use something called psychedelics, okay? Do you know what psychedelics are? Psychedelics are drugs. What drugs, and what these drugs do is they shift your neural system so that you see the world in a different way. When you do that, you're able to have different visions, okay? But we also know that if you go hungry for a long time or you meditate for a long time, you're able to see different things. So from their perspective, they actually saw this thing. Even though we don't think it actually happened. Does that make sense? For them, it's true. But maybe for us, it's not so true. Any more questions before I go on? All right. So these are great questions. And keep on asking them. And these are hard questions that we will go over the next few classes on. So let me show you another picture. Okay. This is what is in the pillars at Goblete Tepe. Now, what's really interesting about these pictures, okay, is that these are animals in the motion of hunting. So the fox, right? The way the fox hunts is the fox jumps up in the ear and then goes down and attacks the prey. So this is in the motion of attack. Why would they do that? What's the point of having animals on these pillars? Why would they do that? Good, okay, yes, okay. So what's really important to understand is that back then, and again, I'll explain to you over the next couple of weeks, back then we human beings did not see us, see us as separate from the other world. Okay? Does that make sense? Animals, trees, humans, all equal. So first of all, if you're gonna kill these animals, you need to ask for their forgiveness. Otherwise, their spirit, their soul will haunt you. Okay? They'll take revenge on you. So if you kill them, you must ask for their forgiveness. Okay? And the one way to do that is by paying tribute to them. That's number one. Number two is that we can learn from these animals. They're the best hunters in the world. So before we go on a hunting trip, we might have a ceremony to channel their energy and power and wisdom. Does that make sense? Okay. And the third thing is basically to appease them or to become their friends. Because we don't want to hunt foxes. We want to hunt gazelle. There's more meat than gazelle. They're easier to capture. But we want to be friends with the gazelle. We want to be friends with the lion. We don't want to be enemies. So it's a sign of respect to the animals. So that was basically their religion. And coming together, the religious festival was about celebrating their relationship with these animals, as well as channeling their power, their energy and the wisdom so that they could go hunt as well. Does that make sense? So this is probably one of the earlier religions that we have. Is this clear to you guys so far? All right. All right. Let's move on. OK. So now this is Jericho. And Jericho is part of something called the Nahtuffian culture. And the Tafean culture appeared about 13,000 years ago, or even more actually, maybe 15,000 years ago, in a place we call the Levant. The Levant is basically the Middle East, Israel and Syria. What was special about the Natafian culture are three things. First of all, they were sedentary. Sedentary basically means that they basically stayed in one place. Remember, hunter-gatherers, they roamed around. They moved from place to place. But they were hunter-gatherers who were sanitary, OK? They were not farmers. They were hunter-gatherers. But they stayed in one place. And the reason why we know, there's a lot of evidence. But one reason why we know is that they basically hunted gazelles. Gazelles are like deer, right? And the thing about gazelles is their tea color is different according to the season. So in the summer and in the winter, it's because they eat different foods, OK? So the tea color is different. So we're able to dig up these gazelle bones, look at their teeth and recognize that, oh, they were hunting gazelle in this area, both in the summer and the winter, which meant they did not move. So they were sanitary. That's the first thing. Second thing is that they had domesticated crops. The reason why we know is we're able to dig up seeds of crops, vegetables and wheat and barley, which meant that they had the capacity, the technology, to farm, but they chose not to farm. Does that make sense? So basically, the way they developed this technology is through gardening. They were hunting, gathering most of the time, but some of them, for fun, for pleasure, had their own garden. And that's how they developed the technology. And the third thing that was very important It's that's what they call the cult of the skull. So they probably worshiped animals, but they also worshiped ancestors. And the reason why we think so is we're able to find a skull in these places. So they basically took someone's head, skull, and put clay on it to protect it. And they put in their houses to worship it. So this is the beginning of ancestor worship. Does that make sense to you guys? So I want to show you this. And it's called the Tower of Jericho. When we first discovered this, we thought, oh, this must be a evidence that Jericho went to war. Because it had walls and then the tower. The walls are to protect you from your enemies. the tower is to see your enemies coming. But then they did more research and realized that, oh no, no, no, this tower is a religious monument. It is the same as Gobletetepe where it is cosmological, meaning that at the longest day of the year, the mountain over here will cast a shadow over the tower. the tower, the tower will cast a shadow over the entire village, covering it all up in darkness. Okay? Does that make sense, you guys? Why would they want to do that? What does that do for you? To have the entire village cover up in darkness. Any guesses? What would they do that? Excuse me? What do you mean by that? I know, but if that were the case, you just move, right? So, okay, so what's really important is that This is like right after the last Ice Age, okay? So it's actually pretty cold, okay? They did this for religious reasons, right? Because when you cover your village in darkness, you feel as though you are in connection with the sky. Does that make sense? So they must have a religious belief in which part of the worship is to cover the village in darkness. That's a good question, okay? So space is dark, right? Do you understand? So when you're dark, you think that I'm bringing space to our village. So I'm collapsing the distance between space and my village. I understand that, but your village is bright anyway. And if you're able to make your village dark, that's magic, right? Do you understand? OK? So they designed a tower in a certain way so that it would cover the village in darkness. And they could see that as magic, and that's evidence that your religion is correct. Does that make sense? Because otherwise, how do you know your religion is correct? Only by performing magic can you show that this charismatic leader who came up with this idea speaks to God. Does that make sense? So let's look at pictures of skulls, because this was actually very common back then. So basically, this is a skull that covered up with clay, and they carried around with them all over the place. And this is true throughout the world at that time. Ancestors worship. So this is another picture of the skull. Let me ask you why they would do that. Their ancestors are dead. Why would they do that? Why would they have to skull around? Where's the ancestors now? Where's the dead person? The spirit world, right? Some place in the world. And therefore having a skull around allows you to communicate with that world and learn its secrets. You understand? And some of the secrets may be like how to construct the tower in a way that you're able to cast a shadow over the village. So that's their method of scientific discovery. Does that make sense? To communicate with the spirit world through your ancestors. Does that make sense? The point I'm trying to tell you is that their level of intelligence or their understanding of the world, It's just as sophisticated as our understanding of the world. We think that when we go to science class, we're learning facts and knowledge. But guess what? Maybe 1,000 years from now, people will look at our science, like the physics, and be like, oh, that was a religion too. Does that make sense? So in terms of intelligence, they were just as creative and as sophisticated as we are today. But they just had a different set of beliefs. So the last place I want to look at is Kata Hoiak. So Kanae Holyak is a huge place in Turkey as well, pretty far from Goblettepe, but about the same place. And this dates back about 7,500 BCE. And as you can see, it's a huge village. And we think that at its height, maybe this was around for about 2,000 years, but at its height of development of civilization, It had about 8,000 people. That's a lot of people, guys. And the thing about Kharahoyak that stands out is, first of all, it's huge. Second of all, they didn't have a place of worship or government, meaning that all the houses were the same. It was a very egalitarian society. Everyone was the same. And what's even more interesting is that if you go to every house, there's a site, the living room, is basically a temple unto itself. It was a place of worship and religion, okay? Meaning that the first, like kind of Hoya, is a place where religion permeated or was in every place they were. So we think that Kata Hoiak is one of the first religious communities. Remember that before religious sites or places you went to, maybe once in your lifetime or maybe once a year, it wasn't part of your everyday life. Whereas in Kata Hoiak, religion was in your life from birth to death. Does that make sense? And the thing about kind of Hoyaq that's very interesting is at this point, their religion is extremely sophisticated, meaning that they can explain everything using their religion. So their everyday life and their religion was completely aligned together. So let me show you some evidence of this. So this is a painting that you will see in every house, for most houses in kind of Hoya. Okay. All right. So you're like, what is going on here? So again, there are different theories, but let me explain to you what most scholars believe to be the accurate theories. Okay. So this is just a theory. We have no evidence for this, but this is what we believe. We believe that the people at kind of Hoya, they worship a mother goddess. Because a mother goddess is what gives life to everything, right? Think of mother nature. Think of a woman giving birth to a child, okay? So they worship a mother goddess. And the mother goddess is represented by the bird. Because the bird flies all around the sky, right? So the sky belongs to the bird. Now the bird can take different forms. This is a vulture, right? So the mother goddess can also take the form of a vulture. So What's going on here? Why is the vulture with headless people? Because the way that they combine ancestral worship with their belief in the mother goddess is they believe that when a person dies, what they'll do is they'll put that person's dead body out in the open, it's a sky burial, right? You're in Tibet, they have sky burials. the vultures will come and eat all the flesh. And that is the tribute or the sacrifice made to the mother goddess. So the mother goddess basically cleans the body. And then you take the bones and you bury it back in your house. And you take the skull. And you keep the skull in your living room to worship your ancestors. Does that make sense? So in other words, it is an extremely comprehensive our complete religion, understanding the world. Is that clear to you guys? What the religion is? Any questions so far? Again, by the way guys, a theory. But right now, the most useful theory that we have about this place. Any questions before I move on? OK. So what's going on here? Now, this again also is in Catahoyak, Mimei houses. So what's going on here? Okay, so different scholars have different interpretations of this, okay? Clearly, this is a hunt, right? This is a hunt. And some people believe that these human beings who are part of the Catahoyak people, they are mocking or taunting or laughing at the animals as a way to subdue them, to tame them, okay? To domesticate them. That's one theory. But another theory is that what they're really doing is dancing because they are worshiping or paying tribute to these animals they are about to kill. Or they are trying, so let's go back to go play a teté, right? Where they're trying to respect the animals, right? Dance with you, we're friends, I'm sorry I have to kill you, but hey, we're only taking your meat, your soul, right? It's still going to be reborn. or it's gonna go to the spirit world. So this is a way of paying tribute or respecting the animals they're about to kill or about to hunt, to maintain the harmony of nature and their relationship with nature. Does that make sense guys? Okay, again, what's really important is that this is a pretty complete religion, right? That explains everything to these people. And that's why it's so attractive to people, right? If you're a human being, you want to know why, well, kind of Hoya, the religion there, explains why. Does that make sense so far? Any questions? So this is a picture of the mother goddess. Again, we have debate about what this is. Some people believe that it's just a fertility goddess. But others believe this is the mother goddess. And you think about it, if you are a place like Kadahoiak, you're most concerned about giving birth, right? Because giving birth is what rejuvenates your society. So it makes sense that your god, the person you worship the most, would be a mother goddess, okay? This is clearly a bull. And if you see pictures of Kadahoiak, you will see that they have many, many depictions or pictures of bull in their house. And what we believe, again, this is a fear. What we believe is that if the mother goddess represents life, giving life, the bull represents vitality energy. And so it's the bull that gives the mother goddess the energy to give birth. Right, does that make sense? So the bull represents the male, The monogamous represents the female. But only the male and the female can join. They come together where you have life. So this is another picture. Clearly, they're not hunting. Clearly, they are worshiping the bull. Does that make sense? They're paying tribute to the bull. So are we clear about this? How religion was a fundamental part of people's existence when they chose to become sanitary, or they chose to settle in one place. So let's go back to the original question and I'll take questions. The original question is, why did people transition into agriculture? And the theory that most scholars believe is because of religion. It was because people had a religious need that they came together to have these religious festivals. There were some charismatic leaders who were so brilliant that people chose to settle down with them. Okay? And so they became sanitary, they developed a religion around the sanitary lifestyle, which included ancestral worship. But over time, because you're in one place, you're gonna deplete the resources of the people, of the area around you, right, of the forest. Which means that you must go to farming. Okay? Does that make sense? So, but then eventually, because you have so much population and you farm too much, you're forced to move somewhere else. And when you move somewhere else, you actually bring your religion with you, okay? And that's how we can explain the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture. And there was no one spark or one moment when this happened. We think it took thousands of years over time because ultimately the hunter-gatherer lifestyle is what's so much more attractive to people, so much easier and attractive to people than the farming lifestyle. The benefit of the farming lifestyle is that you had a religion and that's why people chose ultimately to farm. So that's it. And next class, we'll continue this discussion about early religion and how people develop these religious visions. Next class, we'll look at ice cave paintings that goes back 40,000 years, meaning that they practice this sort of religion or something like this religion 40 to 50,000 years ago. And we know through ice cave paintings. OK, so questions before we finish class. Is this clear to you guys? Anything you're confused about? Any questions before we conclude? Do you see it more clearly? And again, this is all on the internet, by the way. If you're interested, you can go online and just read up more on Kata Hoiak. Okay? These, these places are very famous. We'll be discussing these places throughout the semester. Okay? Gabila Tepe, Jericho, and Kata Hoiak. Excuse me? We discuss all three. Okay? But I'm introducing you to these three places. In future classes, we'll go more in depth into these places. Okay? Because Gabila Tepe is a very interesting place. Okay? And we're only slowly discovering all that's there. Basically, we basically uncovered about 5% of Coppatepe. So over the next two decades, we'll know more. Any more questions? Any more questions? OK. All right. So next class, we will do IHK paintings."}

So last week, we discussed the possibility that Trump will become president. And we discussed that if he does become president in a second term, there will be a very strong likelihood that the United States will go to war with Iran. Now, the question today is, Okay, Trump wants to go to war, but will the US military agree? Ultimately, it is the Pentagon that must implement this war. And if there is enough opposition from the military, then it is very hard for Trump to push a war. I want to make the argument today that the military will go along with the war. And it has to do with what happened in 2003, okay? So let's go back to the last time that America fought a major war. It was the 2003 invasion of Iraq called Operation Iraqi Freedom, okay? So at that time, President George W. Bush and his people, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfritz, they want this war. And they go to the Pentagon and say, listen, we want this war, give us a plan. And the Pentagon, the generals, they're very experienced and conservative people. And in general, when you fight a war, there are three things you must focus on. The first idea is mass forces. When you fight a war, you want to overwhelm your enemy. So when we say mass forces, we basically mean infantry and armor. Most wars are fought using tanks and soldiers. And the Iraq army at that time had about 370,000 soldiers. And in general, the general rule of thumb when you invade a country is you want to have a three to one advantage. The reason why is that when you invade a country, you need to hold territory and resupply your soldiers. So you need to advance. You also need to hold territory, as well as resupply your troops and have reserves. So the general rule of thumb is that if your enemy has 200,000 soldiers, you need about a million. So that's the first principle. Second principle is the idea of, you wanna avoid encirclement. The worst thing that can happen to your soldiers is if they become encircled by the enemy, okay? Because then it becomes impossible to defend yourself. All right? And the third idea is protect supply lines. Most of war is actually just logistics. How do you get oil and fuel and weapons from here to there, okay? Supply lines. So these are the three major principles that you must focus on when you fight a war. So when the Bush government asked the Pentagon for a plan, the Pentagon went to the drawing board and said, to invade Iraq properly, we need about a million soldiers. Okay? And Donald Ronsfeld, who was Secretary of Defense, and his deputy, Wilfred said, no, we're gonna do it with less than a million soldiers. Give us a plan that requires less infantry. And the Pentagon said, okay, well, we shouldn't do this but the most we can do is about 900,000. And Wilfred said, nope, go lower. And eventually, Rones Field and Wolffitt said, I want, we want you to fight this war with 100,000 troops, 130,000 troops, okay? And Pentagon said to Rones Field and Wolffitt, this is insane. We will be outnumbered three to one when we fight this war. How are we going to avoid encirclement? How are we going to mass forces? How will we protect supply lines? And Rones Field and Wolffitt, who are not, by the way, professional soldiers. They've never really fought a war before. They're like, well, we have this theory, a new theory of war called Chakunal. And the idea of Chakunal is that all militaries are hierarchies, okay? You have command and control. So you have the head, and then you have the body, and then you have the arms, and the legs. Well, if we can go and cut off the head, then the entire army falls apart. And we can do that because the nature of war has changed. What the US military specializes in, what gives us the advantage is three things, or three things, okay? First is air supremacy. We control the skies because we have the greatest air force in the world, okay? But second, what's most important is technological omniscience. Omniscience means to know everything. We're God. The reason why is, listen, we have satellites that can see everything on the Earth. We have technology that allows us to e-straw up on all electronic communications. When you talk on the phone, we can hear exactly what you're saying. We know everything on the ground. that allows us to have the power of God. Okay, that's the second thing. The third thing is we have special forces. So special forces are soldiers who go into enemy territory and are able to target and direct air power against the enemy. Okay, and we Americans have the best special forces of forces in the world. And so with these three things, we have a new doctrine of war. We can fight war in a new way that's never been fought before, but which will guarantee that war will be quick, will do it very quickly, cheap, it won't cost that much money, and third decisive, we will completely destroy our enemy. And the Pentagon was like, you guys are insane. This is not going to work. This is a theory, guys. Whereas this idea of mass forces of what it's going to protect supply lines, we've been doing this for like thousands of years. This is just experience. This is just history. This is reality, guys. This is just a fantasy, all right? But Rumsfeld and Wolfritz insisted. And they said, you must fight this war this way. And they insisted. And it turned out that this plan, that the Pentagon, most military planners thought is absurd, insane, unrealistic, worked 100% the way it was supposed to work. Okay? The second Gulf War in 2003 lasted exactly three weeks. three weeks, very quick. The US military with only 130,000 troops was able to destroy an army of during the 70,000 in three weeks, that's one. Second is that America lost at most 200 soldiers and most of it was due to friendly fire, it was accidental. This is insane, this has never happened before. Only 200 American soldiers died at most, whereas tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died. And the third thing that was most impressive is some called fundarons. This is just America flexing or showing off. So what was happening was that America was so dominant that you had these American soldiers in their armored vehicles, drive into Baghdad, the capital city, and they would just drive around, circle it, and no one could stop them. And this is what they call thunder runs, okay? And they did three of these. It was purely an act of intimidation, but it's also just showing off, okay? It's like you're in a fight, and you decide, you know what, I'm so much stronger than this guy, I'm gonna do a backflip, okay? I'm so bored by this guy, I'm gonna do a backflip. Thunder runs. So these three things show the incredible superiority of the structure of shock and awe. So how is America able to achieve all this? Well, I mean, the first thing is the idea of air supremacy. So one bomb called cluster bomb can you wipe out an entire tank division. The reason why is that a cluster bomb inside has about 40 bombs. And these 40 bombs are equipped with GPS. So what they can do is each of these bombs can go and find a tank. It will latch onto a tank and blow the tank up. So this one cluster bomb, which doesn't really cost that much money, can destroy an entire tank division by itself. The other thing is special forces. So the theory is that special forces, if we make them the central core of our military, that will have a devastating impact. And it was true. So what was happening was that special forces could drive around and look for military installations by themselves, which I'm like a few people. And then they could order in a airstrike. and then the planes were blowing up. So shock and awe was extremely effective. But the problem is that people don't really ask what did someone who said do wrong? Why was it so effective against someone who said? And there are actually three reasons, okay? to think that what happened in 2003 was not a revolution in military doctrine, not a revolution in warfare, but just a unique incident in war that doesn't really tell us that much, okay? In other words, what was happening in Iraq could not be replicated, okay? And there were three reasons why. The first is that Saddam Hussein had no ear defense. He had no air defense. He didn't have weapons to counter America's air supremacy. The reason why is that in 1991, Saddam Hussein fought a war against America called the First Person Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm. And his army got destroyed by American air power. And at this point, America could have chosen, could have chose to go invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein. And America didn't. So, Samu's saying learn two lessons from the Persian Gulf War, which is number one, I can never beat America. There's no point in trying. If America wants to beat the crap out of me, I can't stop it, okay? That's the first thing he learned. Second thing he learned is that America probably does not want to overthrow me because if he overthrows me, it would destabilize the country, it would destabilize the region, You would allow terrorists into the country. You would turn my people into terrorists. You would empower Iran. So there's no way that America could overthrow me. Would want to overthrow me. So let me just focus my resources on suppressing internal dissent, okay? So he completely forgot about America. So even when it was clear that America was about to invade, he still did not put up any air defenses because he didn't have any air defenses. So that's the first thing that was unique about the 2003 war. Second thing is that Iraq is a desert. That makes it ideal for shock and awe. Air power can go anywhere. You have satellites that can see everything. Special forces can just drive around. So a desert makes it ideal situation for shock and awe. And the third thing is just surprise. No one in human history has tried to fight a war like this. And so no one knew what was going to happen. So an example is that special forces were in Western Iraq blowing up missile bases because the concern was that Salim Hussein would direct all his missiles, his scuds against Israel, okay? So much damage was being inflicted in Western Iraq that Salim Hussein believed he was so confident that the main American military was actually in Western Iraq when in fact they were in Eastern Iraq. So he divided all his forces to Western Iraq and left Baghdad completely open to attack from the East. So no one had fought a war like this before and no one knew what to expect. But obviously, you can only do this once. So there are three special conditions to make us think that Shakhnaw in the 2003 Iraq war, which is a one-off, it was unique. Unfortunately, the Americans don't know this. The Americans are like, well, all this does is prove our theory to be correct. So after 2003, America focused its military on the military doctrine, it's military on shock and awe. So the example is special forces. So before 2001, America had about 38,000 special forces. Today it has 73,000, that's a lot. Because America has a total army of 1.3 million. The budget for special forces, black ops, was about 2 billion in 2000, 2000 and today it's about 13.7 billion so it's almost an increase of seven times which is a lot but this is just the public official number because special forces are black ops they can operate outside supervision of the military okay So in other words, their actual budget is probably 10 times, possibly 100 times more than the official budget. Now, special forces, I wanna talk very briefly about why special forces is a problem. Now, traditionally, militaries have been very strict hierarchies. And there are good reasons for this. You have to enforce order and discipline. But you're also concerned about the military overflowing the government, right? That's always been a problem throughout history. So you must maintain complete control. But when you do that, you create a lot of problems in the military. It is unable to react very quickly to hostile situations, okay? If terrorists come and attack you, your military can't actually go in to defeat them. It's too slow, okay? Sometimes there are hostiles crisis, okay? So throughout the 70s, a lot of airplanes were getting hijacked by terrorists. For these circumstances, you need special forces, okay? Soldiers who are outside your immediate control who can respond immediately to crises. That's why you have special forces, okay? But in general, you don't want that many special forces because, again, They're outside the control of your military. They're independent sometimes of your military. They have a lot of space to maneuver and to be independent. Now, why are special forces a problem? It's because the people who volunteer for special forces are different from you and me, OK? To put it very lightly. So for example, let's look at one of the top two special forces in the world called SAS, okay? This is British special air services. One of the most elite, certainly the oldest, special forces in the world. The other is Delta. And so you volunteer for special air services, you're applying, okay? And the first test is this. The first test, okay, there are many tests, But the first test is you have to run six marathons in five days. Okay. Oh, that's just beginning. You also have to carry a backpack of bricks while you are running six marathons in five days. Okay. And you're like, okay, that's hard. Oh, one more thing. You're running the marathon on a mountain. Okay. You understand? You have to run six marathons in five days with a backpack of bricks and you have to do it on a mountain somewhere. So even at that first test, there have been some individuals who have gone crazy. You have to put them in a hospital because they've gone crazy. But that just would be the first test. The last test is always torture. They would be tortured to see how much they can resist torture. Because obviously when you're captured, the enemy's gonna torture you to get information out of you. What are you doing here? Who is your commander? Are there other comrades with you? You'll always be tortured. So they also have to withstand torture. There's some other tests. So for example, in the French special services, One test is that you will have to wear a bulletproof vest, okay? And you will have to hold a clay disc, right? And then your comrade will shoot a gun at you. Most people are like, I'm not gonna do this, okay? So in other words, the people who are special forces, they're different from us physically, but they're really different from us psychologically. They have a different mentality. So one Special Forces was interviewed by a reporter, and the reporter asked him, why did you choose to become Special Forces? And his answer is, well, it's either I do Special Forces or I go Robbex. One of the two. In other words, Special Forces are individuals who are addicted to risk and violence. And guys, in America, there's 73,000 of them running around the world trying to protect the American Empire. So special forces have increased, and it's really changed the nature of the American military. So it's good for America because now what Schrockenal allows America to do is be be everywhere at once, and you'll never see them. So for example, the example is when Gaddafi was overthrown in the 2011 Libya war. That was Special Forces. But we don't know this because the Special Forces were hiding the background, directing air power against Gaddafi. So in other words, what Shaw and all really is, is it's more than a theory of war, it's ultimately a theory of empire. America is an empire, but unfortunately, most Americans don't want to omit that because being an empire means doing bad things to innocent people. And what Schachanall allows is for America to be an empire without the guilt of being an empire. You have special forces doing all the work necessary in order to maintain this empire about people actually knowing, all right? So shock and awe is really a theory of empire as opposed to a theory of war, okay? So does this make sense to you guys so far? Okay, any questions so far? Yeah? Okay, so Cillian asked a great question. Are there, there's more special forces. Is it because there's more people who want to be special forces Or is it because America needs more special forces? The answer is both. So again, America, after the fall of the Soviet Union, no longer had a peer competitor. So the understanding of America is that from now on, they would have to fight rogue regimes. So small nations that don't really listen to America, and these nations have to be toppled very quickly. So the examples would be Iraq, Iran, North Korea, the axis of evil. So America started to shift its doctrine to shadow wars, wars that you don't really see, but which would be effective in toppling the regimes you don't like. And so a lot of the resources were shifted into these special forces, not allow more people to enter special forces. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, all right, I have a question before I move on. All right, now the question then is, all right, shock and awe, where does this come from? It comes from one of the greatest disasters for America called the Vietnam War, okay? So from 1965 until 1973, There was a civil war in Vietnam between North Vietnam, which was common in, and South Vietnam, which is basically a US controlled puppet state. And America sent soldiers from 1965 to 1973 to protect South Vietnam from insurgents and rebels. And at the height of this war, 3 million US soldiers had to be deployed. And at the height, in 1969, 500,000 US soldiers were in country to fight against the rebels and the insurgents. 58,000 US soldiers died in this war. 3 million, at least 3 million Vietnamese died in this war. died in this war, two million of them were civilians, innocent civilians, okay? Over 300,000 US soldiers were wounded, okay? They went home without legs, without arms, and they were traumatized. And this was an extremely controversial war in America because they were trying to fight the war using standard military doctrine, mass forces, right? So they instituted something called a draft. So if you were a young American, you had to go fight in this war in Vietnam. But you didn't know why you had to go fight this war. And chances are that you would either die or you would lose a body part in this war. So it became extremely unpopular in America. The other thing is that there were a lot of journalists in Vietnam during this time. They were reporting on how America was killing Vietnamese for no reason. So the most famous story is something called a My Life Massacre where American soldiers went into a Vietnamese village and killed everyone there, 300 people, 400 people. And this was happening actually quite a lot. So there was widespread anger and protest in America at this time, which ultimately forced America to withdraw in 1973. And The US military was very angry about this war because the thing about generals is they don't like to lose wars. When they fight wars, they want to win at all costs. And they felt that they were betrayed by the country. They were fighting hard to maintain the American Empire, to fight against communism. And this was bringing wealth, power, and prestige to America. But the American people, the American politicians, the American democracy, the republic refused to make the necessary sacrifices in order to maintain this empire. And so many American generals felt betrayed by what happened in Vietnam. Now there's a very famous incident during this war called the Pentagon Papers. 1971. In 1971, a group of American analysts, okay, they were, these are military analysts working in the military. They secretly got together and they, and they tried to compose a secret history of the Vietnam War. And this was called the Pentagon Papers. This was meant to be classified. This was not meant to be read by the public. But one of them, Daniel Ellsberg, leaked it to the newspapers, Washington Post and New York Times, and they published it. And people were angry by the Pentagon Papers because what the Pentagon Papers said is, one, America has been secretly fighting this war for a long time. Okay? So many presidents, including Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson were expending this war without public approval, without congressional approval. So there's a lot of deception. That's the first thing. Second thing is that the politicians, the presidents, knew this war was not winnable. You couldn't win this war. And the reason why is that these Vietnamese peasants, they were unbeatable. Because what they were doing was They were digging tunnels underground. And then when American soldiers were coming, they would just pop up these tunnels, shred them, and then disappear back into the tunnels. It was like as though they could swim underground. They were not feedable. Second thing is that they had an unlimited supply of weapons. And you're like, wait a minute. These peasants don't have weapons. And the answer is they got these weapons from their enemies. Okay, so the first thing is that these soldiers, these American soldiers were in the jungle and they were carrying backpacks of ammunition, right? And sometimes they would lose a fight or they would run away in the jungle because it's very hard to carry these backpacks of ammunition, right? They would drop these ammunition and guess what? You're now arming the enemy, right? Because these peasants would pick up these ammo and use it themselves. Because that's the first thing. Second thing is that the US military dropped more bombs on Vietnam than in World War II combined. More bombs were dropped in Vietnam than in World War II combined. Does that make sense? And about 20% of these bombs didn't explode. And if they didn't explode, the enemy could pick them up and transform them into landmines. And it was these landmines that were killing more Americans than anything else. And that's the second thing. And the third thing was that the South Vietnamese army was extremely corrupt. So they were taking these American weapons and selling it to the rebels. So then the question then is, if you can't really see this enemy, they're everywhere. They can swim underground. And if you're supplying them yourself, no matter how much weapons you can bring into this country, how are you going to win this war? The other thing is that these peasants were getting angry at you because obviously in this war you're killing a lot of innocent people, right? Who happens to be their brothers, their sisters, their children, their parents. Okay? So as this war was dragging on, the Vietnamese were becoming more embittered and more angry. So there's no way you were going to win this war. Okay? That's a Pentagon paper, second thing. The third thing is, okay, the question then is, if these American presidents, these American leaders, know for a fact that this war cannot be won, why were they fighting this war? Why were they continuing to fight this war? And the answer is, unfortunately, the answer is credibility, okay? We don't wanna lose face, guys. We don't wanna lose face. If we withdraw from Vietnam, if we admit that peasants in pajamas can beat us, Soviet Union would laugh at us. China would laugh at us. The entire world would laugh at us. We don't be laughed at. So that's why we're staying in this war. So to summarize what the Pentagon Papers said, three things. One is that the American government lied to the people and turn this into a major war. That's first thing. Second thing is that America cannot possibly win this war. And the third thing is that America is only in this war so to avoid losing face. That's it. There was no strategic purpose. There was no strategic objectives from fighting this war. It was just like we don't wanna lose face. We don't be laughed at. That's it. So obviously when the Pentagon Papers were released to the public, everyone was angry. And the anger was so tremendous that America had no choice but ultimately withdraw from the war. And so the Pentagon felt betrayed by democracy. The politicians were more concerned about winning elections than about winning wars. could protest and defy the military. They refused to make sacrifices necessary to win this war. The media could insult the military. So there are many in the military who fought that. Listen, if we are to maintain the empire, we need to divorce the empire from democracy. Okay? Empire and democracy do not get along. If we want to win a war, our greatest enemy is not the enemy, but democracy in America. And that's why you have shock and awe, right? Because the entire point of shock and awe is to minimize casualties. And if there are casualties, you can't see them because they're all blown up, right? And it's quick, so it's impossible for people to start to get angry, OK? Shackle-Naw means that America no longer has to make any sacrifices. You no longer need to consent of the people to fight the war. You don't even need congressional approval to fight the war. You can now escape the shackles of democracy in order to do what you must to protect the American empire. Okay? Does that make sense? So Chaconneau was really a response to Vietnam War. And what Chaconneau means is that the empire is no longer burdened by democracy. Special forces can go and do what they must about any oversight and consent from the people. Okay? Does that make sense, guys? Okay, so this is, Shakhonal is really a fear of empire. What America must do in order to maintain its empire around the world. Any questions before I move on about this? Okay, so Sunni asked a great question which is, okay, I make the argument that Shakhonal only works in Iraq, right? And what would happen in other words? Okay, so the thing about America for the past 20 years, it's been mainly fighting wars in the Middle East. And it turns out the entire Middle East is a desert. So the shock on all policy has had tremendous success in Iraq and then in Libya. Because America overfills us, Gaddafi and Libya. And it's also had some success in Syria as well. So from the perspective of America, we're really only fighting wars in a desert. Shock on all is fine. Okay, but our next class will discuss Iraq. And Iran is not a desert, it's mountains. And I'll show you that Sharkhanah is not gonna work in Iran. Okay, but that's next class. Okay, does that make sense? All right, any more questions? Yeah, okay, so Jack makes a great point, which is, okay, yeah, but most people would say that America lost the Iraq war because of the insurgency, right? Okay, so, okay, that's a great point. Okay, you can make the point that America for the past 20 years have lost all wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because they have not been able to control the insurgency, okay? But the problem with this is that Shakhnaw, it's not designed to stabilize countries. Shakhnaw is meant to topple and destroy countries. Do you understand? And so the argument can be made that the real intention of shock and awe is to make sure that no power in the Middle East can arise to challenge America's supremacy. So yeah, in Iraq, the insurgents ultimately won, but is Iraq a functional state? And the answer is no. Is Libya a functional state? No. There's still civil war going on in Syria. So that's a great point. And it comes down to what is the ultimate design and intention of the empire? Is it to replace regimes or to destroy countries? And you make the argument that Shakhnaw is really designed to destroy countries and not to replace regimes. Does that make sense? Now, what's important to understand is that one of the theories of the invasion of Iraq is to bring democracy to the country. Okay? But the problem with that is from the start, they did everything wrong, okay? So first thing is, they really didn't have enough soldiers to maintain peace, right, in the country, so there's a lot of looting. So the entire country broke down. Second thing is that during the air campaign, America destroyed all the infrastructure necessary for society, okay? So including water supply, including electricity grid. What would you do that if your intention was to bring democracy to the country, right? The third thing is that the very first thing the American government did when they took control over Iraq is something called de-buffercation, okay? Which is to say that if you used to work for the old government, you're now out of other job. Hey, the Iraqi military, you're now suspended. And then the question then is, huh, if your ultimate objective is to bring democracy to the country, why will you destroy all political infrastructure in the country? Why would you destroy the ability for the country to govern itself as well as to maintain order as well as to feed the population? Why would you do that? So an argument can be made that the real intention was not to bring democracy to Iraq, it was just to destroy Iraq, to maintain American supremacy as well as to to teach others a lesson. Don't mess with us, we'll come and destroy you, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, but this is something we will discuss later on, okay, in another class, okay? All right, all right, let's now move to the last topic, which is the theory of empire. So this is not the first theory of empire America had. It's actually the second theory of empire. The first theory of empire was in 1991. Remember that in 1991, America launched an attack against Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, right? So at that time, 1991, the Soviet Union had collapsed. America was the only hegemon, was the only power, and it presented a new theory of empire, how America will rule the world, okay? So the first idea is limited strategic government, goals or objectives. So for example, in 2003, when America invaded Iraq, its strategic goals were pretty unachievable. It was basically like, we're going to bring democracy and peace to Iraq and the Middle East. Whereas in the Persian Gulf War, led by the father, George Herbert Walker Bush, the The first and only goal was to remove Sun Hussain from Kuwait. That's it, okay? We're not gonna go to Iraq and pop up Sun Hussain. We're not gonna inflict punishment on Sun Hussain. All we wanna do is remove him from Kuwait. That's the first thing. Second thing is that America did so with a coalition of countries. Okay? Dozens of other countries were part of the war. And America played a leading role, but it also had to defer to its partners, okay? So for example, countries like Saudi Arabia who participated in the war were like, there's no way we'll topple Saddam Hussein. We'll only stop at Kuwait, okay? So the United States deferred to its partners, okay? And the third thing was, and this is the most important is that The ultimate leader was the United Nations. The United States had to go and make a case to the United Nations. The United States, the United Nations gave its consent to the military action, OK? So the United States made the argument that this is not a US military action. It is a UN military action, OK? And so the important principle is to maintain the rules-based in national order, OK? So what America said at that point is, yeah, I know we are the greatest power in the world. I know the Soviet Union has collapsed. I know that militarily, no one can challenge us. But with this power comes great responsibility. We must show humility. We must show discipline. We must show restraint. Our priority will be to maintain the national rule space order because this will bring prosperity, freedom, and stability to everyone, okay? And that means that if we use military, if we use the military, it will only because it's the last resort, the last option, and only for a limited strategic objective. We will only do so with partners. And we will only do so under the umbrella of UN authority. Okay? So this is the first theory of empire. When you think about it, wow, great. What a wonderful world, right? Here's the question then. Why did America not do this anymore? Why did it switch to shock and awe? Shock and awe is basically unlimited strategic goals, unilateral military action, right? We America will do this by ourselves. We don't need anyone, okay? And in America it's just basically bowling. We make the rules. Why did America do this? Why this transition from the first fear of empire, which is great, it would allow America to rule the world forever, to now the second fear of empire, which is pissing the entire world off. Why? Okay, so this is really hard on the channel, okay? But let's use an analogy, okay? So Jack is my son, okay? And I'm a billionaire. I have $10 billion. Why do I have $10 billion? It's because, one, I'm smart. Okay, I'm smarter than everyone else. Two, I work really hard, okay? And three, I bribe a lot of politicians. So I have $10 billion. But I'm like 95 years old. And I know I'm gonna die, okay? So I invite Jack, who's my son, to dinner. And I say to Jack, Jack, I love you and I want what's best for you. I'm gonna dive very soon and you will inherit my empire. And I want you to know that you don't have to worry about anything Jack, because I have 100 advisors who control this empire, who manage this empire, and they are great. They're experienced, they're loyal, they're strategic. Every year Jack, they make 10% for us. For us, okay, so $10 billion to make a billion dollars for us every year when I go they're still gonna match this empire for us and you know what? They're gonna give you every year Jack $100 million to do whatever you want you want to go by an airplane do that you want to go by an island do that You want to party with movie stars? Do that. You do whatever you want okay, so Jack as my last wish as my dying wish, I want you, Jack, my son, who I love, to promise me that after I die, you will listen to my one hundred advisors, okay? So Jack, do you promise me? You promise me, right? And then I die. And then what is the first thing that Jack will do? The very first thing he will do. Come on guys, not hard. Your first thing you will do is fire everyone. Get out of here. What's the second thing you will do? You're going to hire all your friends, Jack. You're going to hire all your friends. And what's the third thing you're going to do? You're going to do something really stupid. You'll be like, you know what? My dad only made $10 billion. Those advisors only make 10% a year. I'm going to invest in Bitcoin. I'm going to invest in AI. I'm going to invest in the Chinese stock market, the Chinese real estate market, and make $100 billion, okay? And then he loses all the money. You understand? All right? This happens all the time, guys, okay? Ask yourself, if your dad were rich and he was about to leave you a lot of money, would you listen to professional people? No, no, you'd be like, no, I wouldn't have fun, okay? So the question then is, The first fear of empire, okay, which said that for America to maintain its empire, it must demonstrate to the world humility, discipline and restraint. Why did they get rid of this and move to shock and awe, which is like, we'll do anything we want. Why? Why? Why would they do that? Because it's fun. Okay, do you understand? What is the point of having an empire if you cannot blow things up for no reason. There's no point. We have the greatest military in the world. Let's just blow things up for no reason. Okay? All right? Now, there are three fundamental problems with Shakhonah. Okay? The first problem is that you become over committed. And do you understand? You believe that Shakhonah allows you to be God. You can be anywhere at once fighting all wars. Okay? You're over committed. Second is you lack strategic focus, meaning that you actually don't have a plan. You don't know what you wanna do with this empire. You just wanna maintain this empire. So you don't have, I said, a strategy in place. And the third thing is hubris. You don't think anyone can challenge you. You don't think you can lose a war. Okay? And so the idea of hubris is this. Right now America has this huge empire and it's refusing to spend the necessary resources to protect the empire. So for example the US Navy, okay? 1945 it had 7600 ships. Today guess what guys? It has 475. These 475 ships must go all around the world to protect shipping lanes. Okay? The US military, in 1991, during the first person goal of war, had two million soldiers. Today, it has 1.3 million soldiers. So in other words, if America ever fights a war, a major war, it's going to have a lot of problems. The other thing is that America doesn't even have manufacturing capacity anymore. It doesn't have any factories anymore, which means that if it fights a war, it can't fight a war for a very long time. So the example is that for every ship that America makes, China can make 300 ships. America no longer has this manufacturing capacity that it had during World War II. So in other words, why will the military agree to the stupid war in Iran? Because it's over committed, it has no strategy, and it's because it's arrogant. And the military is like this because of what happened in 2003, Shakhnaw. Doesn't make sense to you guys. So next class we will look at what the Iran word will look like. And I guarantee you that Shakhnaw is not going to work in Iran. But I'll explain why next class. Any questions before we end for the day? Oh, so Selen asks a great question. What's the difference between the people who believe in the first theory and the second theory? And the answer is this. The people who believed in the first theory came from an older generation. This is a generation that fought in World War II and who fought the Cold War. So they understand what war looks like. War is really bloody and it's terrible. And we must do our best to avoid war. The second generation, 2003, are individuals who don't know what war is. Okay? Like if you actually look at videos from 2003, the war, it actually looks like a video game. You understand? You don't actually see what they saw in Vietnam, which was all these soldiers losing their arms and crying, okay? I mean the images from Vietnam were just terrible. It was hard for people to watch, but the goal of the 2003, it was just a video game. It was just like things being blown up, okay? You actually see the people dying. And again, only 20 people died, 20 soldiers died in 2003, okay? So in other words, unfortunately, America is headed towards disaster, okay? Because the people in charge have no experience. They don't know what war is. And they don't know what the horrors of war is. and they've inherited a lot of money and they want to enjoy the money. They want to have fun. Does that make sense? Okay, great, so I'll see you guys next class."}
{"video_id": "JZ8P-FZHWnQ", "title": "Civilization #49:  The Dutch Golden Age and the Rise of the Middle Class", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ8P-FZHWnQ", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 4240.2203125, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 9665, "text": "Okay, good morning. So we start the very last section of the course today. It's on the Anglo-American Empire, which rules the world today. So we will first look at the rise of the British Empire. And to understand the rise of the British Empire, we first need to discuss the rise of the Spanish Empire. So let's go back and we discussed that it was the Spanish who were the first to colonize the New World. And they did so because they were looking for gold and silver. And it turned out they found a lot of gold and silver. And all this money was now going back to Spain. and that became the basis of the Spanish Empire. And you would think it's a really good thing that they found all this gold and silver, but it was a disaster for the nation. And the reason why is that at this time in history, Spain was a feudal Catholic monarchy. And all this money just made this system even worse. So let me explain. A feudal system means that there are rigid, there's a rigid hierarchy of status. The nobles and the clergy at the very top. And because of all this gold and silver, the clergy and the nobility don't actually have to pay taxes anymore and they actually have to make no contribution to society. All right, so you have this group of parasites that are sucking up a lot of wealth. a lot of energy within Spain. Okay, so that's the first problem, this feudal system. Second is the idea of Catholic. So because of the Catholic religion, people don't really care about what happens today. They care about what happens when they die. They care about making sure that they have a place in heaven. So they get all this money from the New World and none of it goes into industry and innovation and technology and science. All of it goes into religious activities. For example, religious festivals, churches, masses, and all this money is being wasted on these religious festivals. And the third thing is monarchy. So they have a king, and this king also happens to be, through marriage, the king of the holy woman empire, which is most of Europe. So if you're king, you have an infinite amount of money, what do you do? Well, you go on a series of stupid, pointless wars all around Europe. And he was fighting the Ottomans, he was fighting the French, he was even fighting the Catholic Church because he wanted to be stronger and have more authority than the Pope. And he was paying for these wars with this gold, but also by borrowing. And so at the end of the 16th century, Spain, even though it was at this point in history, the most powerful empire, the world's worst empire, with the largest army, it went bankrupt basically. All right, so this system was a disaster for Spain. Spain. Another issue is because of feudalism, the Spanish nobility thought it was beneath them to work hard. They believed that it was contemptuous to exert yourself, to be a noble means to sit back and enjoy life. Okay, so this money was a disaster for Spain. So to understand what happened, just think of an analogy. Let's just say today I give each of you 100 million US dollars. You think that's a lot of money. And so you go and you waste it all on ski trips, on buying a new Maserati, on buying a private plane. And then you recognize, oh, you know what, if I keep on doing this, this, I'm eventually going to go bankrupt. So what do you do? Well, you go and you invest in businesses, right? And you recognize that, hey, if I go to invest in businesses, what I should do is borrow money from the bank in order to have greater leverage in order to make more money. And the bank says, well, you have $100 million, so I will give you money. And so you get, you take about a billion dollars in loans. And because you're You're not a very sharp business person. You have no business. You have no experience running a business. Well, in 10 years time, all your business go bankrupt. And so you find yourself a billion dollars in debt. You start out with $100 million, and then through reckless expansionism, you have a billion dollars in debt. And that's exactly what happened to Spain. All right, but this system created opportunities for those who did work hard. And these three countries that will take advantage of this system are France, England, and Holland. Or what we call the Dutch Republic. Don't worry about the name for now. And so there are three ways in which they took advantage of this new system that the Spanish created. The first is through industry. And what this means is the Spanish didn't have any industry. They were still an agricultural-based nation, but they wanted textiles, they wanted finished goods. So the French, the English, and the Dutch, they did work hard because of the religion. They were Protestants, and they believed in hard work. And so this created a middle class for them. So they industrialized because of Spanish demand. So that's the first way that these three countries benefited. The second way is propiracy. So what was happening was that these ships were transporting all this gold and silver from the New World back to Spain, which means that you can just hijack these ships and steal all their gold and silver for yourself. And piracy became the official policy of the English. All right, so Francis Drake was the most famous pirate of this time, and he was like an admiral in the British Navy, sponsored by the Queen, Queen Elizabeth I. And he was a national hero because he would go and he would steal all this gold and silver from the Spanish and replenish the The English crown. All right, so piracy was a really important way. These three countries made money off Spain also because of piracy These three countries were forced to innovate in their Navy So the system of naval warfare at this time is that you would ram your ship at at another ship, you would board it and then you would take over that ship. Okay, so it was hand-to-hand combat. And what the English figured out was, you know what? We're going to have cannons on our ship and then just pound the other ships from a distance. Okay, basically artillery and long-range fighting. And that's what the English pioneered and that's why eventually they become, over time, the greatest navy in the world. All right, so piracy was a very important factor in development of the English Navy. Now, third thing is food trade, okay? But specifically food smuggling. So the idea is all this territory in the New World was controlled by the Spanish crown. And so everyone started to smuggle in order to avoid paying taxes and levies to the crown. So what were they smuggling? Well, they were mainly smuggling slaves, okay? So slaves were, for most of human history, the most profitable product that you could trade. And this was even more true at this time. Because the New World had these plantations, and they needed people to work these plantations, so they started to transport slaves from Africa to the New World. Now there is a misconception in history that the Europeans went to Africa, kidnapped the slaves, and then transport them to the new world, okay? This is not true. The reason why it's not true is the Europeans actually did not want to go to Africa and stay there. And the reason why is malaria. So what's happening was that the Europeans set up training centers around Africa and it was the Africans themselves who would give the European slaves. And the reason why is these nations, these tribes in Africa were fighting against each other and the custom at the time is if you lost a war then we would enslave the entire population and then sell you to the Europeans. So not only were the Europeans getting rich off this trade but so were many African clans and tribes. So that is what happened. The other thing is, what people may misunderstand is Most of the profit was actually not in gold and silver. At this time in history, the most profitable product, the thing that was most valuable is actually spices, things like nutmeg, cinnamon, peppercorn. These are the things that Europeans really value. One ship of these things was enough to make fortunes for entire families for generations. So in other words, the center of trade was not actually in the New World, but actually in Southeast Asia. Okay, Southeast Asia. Okay? So from China, Europeans imported silk and porcelain. And from the Southeast Asian islands, Indonesia basically, they imported spices. Okay? So this became known as the East Indies. The East Indies. And this is where the money was to be made. Okay? So the key to world conquest was who could control the trade routes into the East Indies. So the people that first really figured this out were the Dutch. So the Portuguese are here, but the Portuguese are like the Spanish. They are a Catholic nation. But the Dutch are the ones who figure out how to make a lot of money out of the East Indies. So how were the Dutch able to succeed? It has to do with the fact that at this time in history, the Dutch were controlled by the Spanish. The Spanish were in charge of the Habsburg Empire, which included Spain, sorry, which included the Dutch. So at this time in history, the Dutch are part of something called the Low Countries. Low Countries include today the Belgium and the Netherlands. That's considered the Low Countries. And for the longest time, the Low Countries have been part of the Holy Roman Empire. And this system worked well for the Low Countries because they were poor, they didn't have much resources, so they were left alone by the Holy Roman Empire. They had a lot of local autonomy. They were very independent and very egalitarian nation. And everyone there, because it was cold, it was poor, people worked hard. And the Low Countries was one of the first places to develop textiles. And as such, they started to trade with Spain. They became wealthier. But over time, as Spain became more powerful, it wanted to exert more authority over the Low Countries. What's happened at this time is Protestantism is spreading all across Europe. And the king of Spain wanted to maintain capitalism in the low countries. And it's brought them to conflict with the people in the low countries. And this criticism is called the 80 Years War. It was really a war of independence. So there were certain individuals, certain cities in low countries that want independence from Spain. And of course, Spain wanted to maintain control. This war will last for 80 years. Now the problem is that Spain, it is the most powerful nation in the world at this time. The low countries, it's like 1.5 million people at this time. So it's a very, very small place. And so they can't possibly fight Spain, but they persist because you're led by religious fanatics. And over time, what they realize is even though they can't beat Spain on land, They can actually beat Spain in the sea. So what they recognize is, you know what? The way to beat Spain is, if we can control the trade in these Indies, that's going to give us the military, that's going to give us the wealth and the resources to defeat Spain. But we are a small and poor nation. So how can we best do this? And the solution would forever change human history. In 1602, they created something called the Dutch East Indies Company. And it's known as VOC in Dutch. The Dutch East Indies Company. This is really important in human history, because this is considered the first multinational corporation in the world. This corporation, it's not controlled by the government, but it has the power of government. It can raise its own military. It can create its own laws. It can issue its own currency. And this company will go on to become the most profitable and most valuable company in the whole world. If you take Apple, Microsoft, and Google, these three companies, and you combine them together, they would still not be as wealthy as the Dutch East Indies Company. And the reason why is they had a monopoly over trade for spices in these Indies. So then the question then is, why would the Dutch do this? Why would the Dutch go out and create their first multinational corporation? And the answer is, they needed a way to unite the people of the low countries into fighting the Spanish. How do you incentivize the people into fighting the Spanish? Most people were indifferent. They're like, we don't really care, the Spanish are far away, but you had some fanatics who wanted independence, but you also had some individuals who were heavily Catholic. Eventually what will happen is the people who are independent will move north to the Netherlands. And the people who want to remain Catholic will move south to Belgium. That's why if you go to Europe today, if you go to Belgium, it's heavily heavily Catholic. But if you go to the Netherlands, which is still one of the world's countries in the world, it's actually Protestant. Okay? And that's what happened. Okay? So they need to unite the people. And the best way to do that is to incentivize them by giving them shares, equity, in a company. Okay? So now people have actually have an incentive actually fight the British because if the Dutch East Indies company makes money, they get rich. And that's what actually happened. The Dutch East Indies company will become extremely wealthy and so that will create a middle class in Holland. So the first issue is equity. But also if you think about it, this is actually a very clever way to raise taxes. Because if you try to get taxes from people, they will rebel against you, right? But if you say, listen, we have this company and if you invest in it, you might get rich. Well, this is equivalent of selling war bonds to people, right? So that's the idea. And that's why the Dutch East Indies Company, it really marked a turning point in the war between the Dutch and Spain. Also, this will allow the Dutch East Indies Company to work hard to control the trade in the East Indies. Indies because if they work hard they're the ones who profit not not the king and over time what will happen is the Dutch East Indies company will push out the Portuguese and they will monopolize this entire area and as a result they will become extremely wealthy. What's important to remember and this is why the Dutch actually don't really talk about this history is a lot of Italian horror happens because of this process okay because they're a multinational corporation only interested in profit, they commit ethic cleansing. They basically wipe out the population. They enslave people to work in plantations to grow these spices. They will constantly engage in a series of wars against the Portuguese, the English, and the French in order to maintain control over the monopoly. But over time, what they will recognize is they don't actually have the population resources to maintain their empire, so they will retreat and leave this empire to the French and the English, but there were still big subcontractors to the English and the French, and that's why the Netherlands remains one of the wealthiest countries in the world today. A lot of their wealth is hidden. All right, so what's important for us to understand is, this war is actually driving the growth of the middle class and Protestant in Europe. So let's review the Protestant religion. So it's actually Calvinism. So there are actually two major ideas that differentiate Calvinism from Catholicism. The first is the idea of justification by faith. So in the Catholic religion, you show your faith to God by doing good works, by giving money to the church basically. But in the Calvin religion, which is what the Dutch Republic adopts, it's justification by faith, which means that you and God communicate. And God knows if you are faithful and you yourself know if you're faithful. So if you spend money, if you build stuff, that doesn't matter. The works doesn't matter. What matters is your true faith. Okay? That's the first thing. Second thing, which is more important, is the idea of double predestination. So remember from our lecture on the Protestant religion, reformers are trying to destroy the influence of the Catholic Church because they think the Pope is evil. All right, so the main power of the Catholic Church comes from the idea that it's a church who decides whether or not you go to heaven and for how long. Sorry, whether or not you go to heaven, if you don't go to heaven, then you go to purgatory and for how long? So the church has control over your act of life. And so what the Calvinists believe is, no, the church doesn't because at the beginning of time, even before the world was created, God had already decided who would go to heaven and who would go to hell. That's the idea of double predestination. Your destiny has already been decided. And only a minority called the elect will go to heaven. Everyone else will be damned to hell. And again, these ideas were created in order to erode the loot, destroy the influence and power of the Catholic Church so that people can be liberated from the church in order to celebrate God in the proper way. But we discussed this, these two ideas will now create a new problem, which is how do you know if you are part of the elect? Right? How do you know? Well, I believe so, I believe, but how do you really know? And the answer discovered is you know through your virtuous hard work. Okay, through simple hard work. Okay. And so how do you know if you are working hard? How do you know that your life is simple enough? Well, because you're accumulating money. Does that make sense? Money now is actually useful. Before it wasn't that useful. But now, money is now a testament to your faith. And this marks a radical change in human perception, in human identity. Before, we were people very much focused on status. Now we focus on wealth. So let me explain the difference. What does status mean? Status just means how you are perceived in your community. So you work hard in order to win approval from your peers. So remember Vikings, OK? The Vikings would go on these crazy adventures. Why? Because they would come back and tell these stories that would entertain and impress their peers. OK? Also remember, the Vikings, if they have money, what they would do is this. Remember the Viking funerals. A third of all their wealth would go into funeral expenses, okay? Having a big feast for everyone. A third of their wealth would then go into the funeral clothes, dressing well for the funeral. And a third of their money would then go on to the family members. All right? So for most of human history, we didn't believe it was important to have money. What's important was to impress the community. And that's why you make any money, you would immediately come back and hold a huge feast for the community, right? And that's still true in China today, where you know, you are from a village, you come to Beijing, you open a restaurant, you make a lot of money. What do you do? You go back to your village and you hold a huge feast for the villagers, right? Okay, so that's the idea of status. And that's what before we were concerned about. Now we're concerned about wealth. Why? Because wealth is a measure of your faith. It is a testament to whether or not you will go to heaven or not. Alright, and this marks a radical change in human perception. And this creates the idea of class now, okay, in the market. Alright, so does this make sense guys? Alright, so the other issue is now that the Dutch fruit trade, they're making a lot of money, but at the same time, they're actually not allowed to spend their money because they have to exemplify simple hard work, then how do they enjoy their wealth? Okay, and the answer is through art. So now you have an art market in the first time in human history. Before art was something that was patronized by the wealthy, but as the middle class rose in the Dutch Republic, Now the middle class can enjoy art. And this will mark a radical change in how art is created, okay? And also because of this, you have a new idea called materialism. So the accumulation of goods. If you don't spend your money on the community, you don't spend your money on the church, what do you spend your money? You spend your money on the house, right? On where you live. So that's why it's important to buy silk and porcelain from China. That's why you wanna buy spices. because it's a measure of your wealth within the household. Okay, remember, and this is really important. This is driven by three factors, okay? The first factor is anxiety. Anxiety comes from a fact that you don't know if you're faithful to God or not. So you must prove to yourself you are faithful, okay? So that's the first idea, anxiety. Second is the idea of uncertainty. Uncertainty means that at this time in history, the Dutch Republic is at war with Spain. Spain, again, is the most powerful empire in the world. You don't know if you'll survive. You don't know if the Dutch Republic will survive against Spain. And it probably will not. But the uncertainty also comes from the fact that trade is precurious. Right now you're wealthy because the Dutch East Indies company is profitable and you have stock in the Dutch East Indies company, But it's also possible tomorrow England or France or Spain comes and webs out the Dutch East and East from there. So there's a lot of uncertainty in your life. And the third thing is competition. Because remember, only a few people will go to heaven. But there's a lot of wealthy people in the Dutch Republic. So how do you prove that you're better than the other members of the middle class? Well, there's going to be competition. You have to prove that you are a more simple, more faithful individual. And because of these three factors, anxiety, uncertainty, and competition, it will drive three major developments in human society, the creation of money, the creation of the art market. The art market also includes literature, by the way, but that comes later. And the ideal materialism in human life. And if you think about it, this is now becomes the prototypical middle class identity. And so even though we're in China and we are not a Christian nation, and we never went through this history, the middle class in China still has the values and the ideas that the Dutch had 500 years ago. Chinese middle class is obsessed with money making, it's obsessed with materialism, and it's obsessed with the accumulation of artistic objects. And so that's the history here. Any questions before I go into the evidence and some of the history? Was this clear to you guys? Okay, I know I'm going fast, but we have a lot to do in order to finish the semester. Okay, so let's go over some of the history. Okay, so the Dutch go to an age. All right, so 1588 is basically when the war between the Dutch Republic and Spain really begins to take off. So let's go over some basic background about the Spanish Empire, okay? So remember, Spain has territories in the new world. What's important is that Spain is not colonizing the new world. Okay? Spain is only interested in extracting resources, specifically gold and silver, from the new world. Okay? So there's no colonization going on. There's just economic exploitation going on. And the ships, the Navy is designed only to take the gold and silver back to Spain. And again, what this does is it creates opportunities for piracy, which the English and the Dutch will exploit very heavily. And these centers of economic exploitation will also need a lot of slaves. And so the English, the French, and the Dutch will take these slaves from Africa and smuggle them into the plantations to feed these colonies. So this wealth allows Spain to enter its golden age. And one of the main artists of this golden age is actually Maguall Cervantes. And he's famous because he wrote a novel called Don Cajote de la Mancha. And it's considered the first great novel, or the first novel in human history. It is an amazing book, Don Cajote de la Mancha. I would love to teach it to you at the time, OK? But it's about 1,000 pages. But you know what, it's easy to read. You can read it by yourself. I highly recommend it. Don Quixote de la Mancha. But during this time, of course, you also had great artists and great literature happening as well. This money was being wasted in Spain. It was being wasted in building these wonderful, beautiful buildings like El Escarreo in Madrid. It's just outside of Madrid. And it took about an entire year bringing back golden silver from the new world to build this building. But for the longest time, this was the largest building complex in the entire world. Spanish, because the Spaniards were so wealthy, became the fashion trendsetter for all of Europe. So Spanish dress, Spanish clothing became popular throughout all of Europe, especially England. So what will happen is the Spanish royal family will marry into the Habsburg and the Habsburg family controls the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs are like the most famous dynasty in Europe at this time. They will marry and then Charles will inherit both Spain as well as the Holy Roman Empire which includes the Netherlands, okay? And so this is his empire, and as you can see, it's actually most of Europe. This is Spain, and this is the Holy Roman Empire, which includes the Netherlands, the Low Countries. The problem though is once you have this territory, you have to defend it. And so he comes in conflicts with all the great powers of the day, okay, including France, which is the peer competitor to Spain at this time. He'll also come into conflict with the Prostans under Martin Luther. He's trying to step up the rise of panaceism, especially Calvinism in Europe. He will also come in conflict with the Ottomans. And he will also come in conflict with the Pope. So with all this money, the king of Spain is causing wars with just basically everybody. And he becomes a bit of a bully, which bankrupts the nation. The problem with the Habsburg is they have a terrible reputation for inbreeding. They only marry within the family. And if you do that over three or four generations, you get this guy, King Charles II. And this is what you get. So incest is a bad thing. We outlaw incest for a very good reason. And because of this he has no here, which causes the end of the Spanish Empire. Alright, so the Spanish Empire as we discussed will allow for the rise of the Dutch Republic. The Dutch Republic it's rising because it has very strong industry and then it builds trade networks all around the world. So as we discussed, it controls the Baltic trade, and what it does is it basically trades textiles across this area, and then it will trade slaves across the Atlantic, and then it will monopolize trade in the East Indies. And that's why in the 17th century, the Dutch Republic will become the wealthiest nation in the world. and its middle class will become the most prosperous and wealthiest in the world at this time. Okay, because all this trade. All right, so this is a map that shows you the extent of trade in the Dutch Republic, okay? So this is a Spanish, and as you can see, most of the trade is actually focused across Atlantic. All right, this is the French, they get involved as well, but their trade is nowhere near as dense as the Dutch and the British. And eventually, the Dutch and the British will come into conflict with each other in the Anglo-Dutch wars for dominance over the seas. And what will happen is the Dutch will win most of these naval battles. The Dutch are superior, are superior sea people, but the British are much more persistent. And the British have a much greater population. The British are like the Romans. Remember, the Romans didn't win that many battles, but they just never gave up. They were relentless. And they were willing to make, they were willing to sacrifice most of the population in order to eventually win. That's just the British mentality. They weren't great at, they were not as superior as the Dutch at sea, or against the Spanish and the French on land battles, but they were just much more relentless and persistent. All right. So let's go over the major differences between Spain and the Dutch Republic, okay? How was the Dutch Republic able to rise and defeat Spain and win its independence? Well, the first thing is Spain was a Catholic religion that focused on Orthodoxy, okay? So everyone had to be Catholic and everyone had to obey the power of the church. And so you may not have heard something called the Spanish Inquisition, right? So it was the Spanish who created, people called the Jesuits, were responsible for enforcing orthodoxy within the Catholic world. And the Jesuits will come to China as well and spread the Catholic religion. Now, Dutch, because they were smaller, they had fewer people, they were forced to be tolerant. So all these Jews that were being expelled from Spain and up in the Dutch Republic. And it's important that you have a group of Jews within your nation. Why? The first reason is they have these trading networks. Remember, there's a Jewish diaspora and the Jews have these trading networks all across the world, especially within the Ottoman Empire. Okay? That's the first reason. Trade. Second is finances. So historically, Jews have these financial networks all across Europe. And so you need a lot of money to start a war where you often go to Jewish financiers. Okay? And third is intellectual. the Jewish people are extremely open minded, extremely intellectual, and they bring in new ideas. So one of the most famous intellectuals at this time is named Brak Spinoza, and he's Jewish. All right, but it was not just Jews. Everyone was allowed to practice their religion in the Dutch Republic freely, and that was one of the main drawing points about the Dutch Republic, the tolerance. This is important because the Dutch Republic will become the model for the American Republic. Second difference is Spain was a empire focused entirely on economic exploitation. They were only concerned about extracting resources. Whereas the Dutch was just focused on mercantile trade. This is important because if all you do is focus on exploitation, this will lead to mismanagement and this will lead to a lot of wealth inequality. And that was the issue facing Spain. But if you focus on mercantile trade, then you can create a middle class, which is what happened in the Dutch Republic. And the third major difference, of course, is noble and clerical privilege. So only the elite benefited from the Spanish Empire. Whereas the Dutch Republic, because they were small, they had to focus on middle class growth, making sure that as many people as possible benefited from trade and commerce. It was really training commerce that allowed the Dutch Republic to become so wealthy over time. And because the Dutch Republic, it's very small and the land isn't great, the Dutch Republic became more wealthy, they focused a lot of the resources on building canals and on land reclamation from the sea. And so as time progressed, the land increased. All right, so another really important thing to remember about the Dutch Republic is that it's a coalition, it's a federation of different city-states, okay? There's seven different places within the Dutch Republic, okay? That's why it's a republic and not a monarchy, because a lot of their decision-making has to go through consultation and diplomacy. Now, this is also why they created the Dutch East Indies Company, because the The fear was that if they didn't have a monopoly, a company to control the monopoly, then if different city-states would compete against each other for the East-Indies trade, they didn't have the resources to do that. That's why they combined the resources to create the East, the Dutch East-Indies company. What's important, first remember, is that throughout its history, the Low Countries, The Netherlands, they were an egalitarian, independent, open-minded people. And so some of the most famous philosophers were coming from this region, including Erasmus, who is contemporary of Martin Luther and who was one of the great philosophers and theologians. He's primarily responsible for something called the Northern Renaissance. will allow for the rise of Spinoza. And again, he's formally Jewish, but then he becomes, he creates a new religion called Pantheism. You might have heard about Pantheism, but Pantheism is the idea that God is within every living being, including trees, including animals, including us. And therefore, we're all connected through the essence of God. Let's talk about art. I want to focus the rest of the lecture on art because art will give us a portal into the mindset and psychology of the Dutch people. Before we do that, let's talk about Spanish art. This is a Spanish golden age and a lot of this money is going into patronizing great art. As you can see, Spanish art is very Catholic. If it's Catholic, then it's very allegorical. They're drawing images from the Bible and from Catholic tradition, and it's a worship of the religion. So this is Madonna, the Mary, and this is baby Jesus. And you can see everyone's worshiping Jesus. The plazas are iconoclasts, which is they do not allow for depictions of their god in imagery. OK? This is another great artwork from the Spanish Golden Age. As you can see, it's heavily allegorical, metaphorical. This is the most famous painting of the Spanish Golden Age by a painter named Diego Vadaquez. You probably have heard of him. He's one of the most famous painters in the world. This is his most famous painting called Las Menales, the Handmaids. What's amazing about this painting is that we are actually, as we're observing those painting, this painting is actually observing us as well. Okay, does that make sense? Because this is a painter, right? So a painter is looking at us as we're looking at him. Now, who is really drawing is the royal couple, okay? As this mirror shows. But as you can see, we are also within the universe universe of this painting. I mean, there's a lot to say about this painting. It's one of the most famous paintings in the world. But we have a lot to do today, so I'll move on. These are landscape paintings. And as you can see, there's a lot of spirituality, a lot of allegory, a lot of divinity embedded within these paintings. So this is a Catholic mentality. So let's move on to the Calvinist Dutch mentality of paintings. All right. So let's do a compare and contrast. This is the Dutch painting. This is a Catholic Spanish, no, no, sorry, sorry. This is actually an Italian Renaissance painting by Coraggio, okay? And this is baby Jesus and Madonna, and there are two individuals, supplicants who are worshiping Madonna. All right, so this is the Catholic mentality which is God can be with us at any time. So, this is the Dutch equivalent where this is a middle class woman and these are two street musicians who are trying to interact with this world. What's really important for us to understand is with the rise of the middle class, there's a huge focus on hierarchy and boundaries. Why? Because the middle class itself is a very fluid, very flexible, and a certain group of people. So their paintings will reflect this anxiety and this uncertainty. So as you can see, the inner world is full of light, the outer world is pretty dark. And this door is a portal. Within the house there's a divinity, but in the outside world there's only darkness and mystery. So God is within your household basically. So there's a lot more to be said, but as you can see there's a huge contrast between the Calvinist mentality and the Calvinist mentality. Alright, Let's move on. So still life is a very important aspect of Dutch painting. Dutch still life, it captures the material world as it is. It's a celebration of material world. Because remember, the Catholics celebrate the afterlife, but the communists, the pros and the celibate the here and now, okay? They do that through depictions of life, in the household. And what will happen is this. At first, the Dutch Republic, it's at war and it's very poor because all this money is going into the military. But when the war ends, when the Spanish actually concede independence to the Dutch, you can see the wealth for everyone increases dramatically. And once there's peace established, then the Dutch will become the wealthiest nation in the world. And arguably, okay, arguably, even today, the Dutch are still the wealthiest middle class in the world, but a lot of their wealth is hidden, okay? All right, because the Dutch are Calvinists, they feel that life is a struggle between their urges and their faith, okay? So in this painting that depicts that, this man who's fat, he represents festival. He represents giving into your urges, eating, drinking, being married. And this person is called Lent, which is the Christian virtue of fasting and showing restraint, showing temperance. So the Dutch see life as a constant struggle between your urges and your faith, between your emotions and reason. And this picture depicts that. And so what paintings are doing is it's taking all this internal anxiety within you as a person because of your faith, and it's transposing and projecting it onto the painting in order to create a visual depiction of your anxiety as to relieve your anxiety. Does that logic make sense to you guys? And that's what drives the need or the desire to demand for middle class art. during the 17th century, it's only about 100 years, right? From 1600 to 1700 in the Dutch Republic, and we're only talking about between one and two million people, five to 10 million paintings will be sold, okay? Five to 10 million paintings will be sold. That's the, that gives you a sense of the appetite for the sort of visual depiction. One thing that obsesses the Dutch middle class are the poor. Why? Because the middle class, they are an anxious, uncertain group of people. So the way they define themselves is they try to differentiate themselves from other groups of people, including the poor and the nobility. ability. So in their imagination, the poor are, this gives themselves up to temptation. They're drinking all the time, they're getting drunk, they're lazy. Does that make sense? And by depicting the poor in this way, it's almost like a talisman to protect themselves from being poor. It's going to taboo. The worst thing that can happen to us is if we become poor people, like these people, because we'll end up drunk. Prostitution is also a very popular theme among the Dutch middle class. So what's interesting is prostitution at this time, it's very popular in the Dutch Republic. And hey, If you go to Amsterdam today, it's still popular, right? Amsterdam is sort of famous for the legalization of prostitutes. So at this time, what's happening is you have all these prostitutes, but good middle class women were responsible for going and negotiating with them in order to satisfy their husbands. Okay, does that make sense? So the idea of prostitution, It is a huge topic in the Netherlands. And it's a cause of a lot of anxiety and uncertainty and desire within the middle class. Another depiction of poor people. So as you can see, they're having fun all the time. And if you focus on these two individuals, this man who clearly has these sexual urges, He's trying to slowly take this maiden who's resisting, but he really can't resist into his world. And so this is saying like, if you ever become poor, you just cannot resist the temptations and the urges of this world. So the worst thing that can ever happen to you is, if you become poor. Another depiction of what it means to be poor. Okay, to surrender yourself to luxury and to the moment. This is still life. And so the idea of here is one of access, okay? And so, that's the call to hear. It's very interesting, all right? But let me give you an analogy. Let's just say that you are trying to lose weight, okay? You're kind of fat, or you're not fat, but you feel you can lose weight. So when you're trying to cut back on food, you have all these temptations, you have all these desires. So one way, one strategy that you have is, if you watch a lot of videos where fat people are binging on food, okay? Just by watching these people, your sort of anxiety, your sort of desire decreases. And that's the strategy of these paintings where you have these paintings of access and wealth. And just by observing these paintings, by putting these paintings in your household, they become signals to you that you should not engage in any excessive activity. You should lead a life of moderation and temperance. Another picture of a prostitute or a poor person. So you have all these paintings about the life of the poor. And what's really interesting is, yes, it's obvious we don't be poor, but these paintings are also very seductive, right? They're trying to show you, oh, you know what? It's actually pretty nice, a lot of fun to be poor as well. And that's what the Dutchmen of class really enjoy. They like to enjoy this anxiety between not having something because it's bad for you and wanting it, OK? This is a very famous painting called the Precuris. So remember, within this world, it's very common for middle class women to go solicit prostitutes for their husbands. And the middle men is someone called the Precuris. And she looks satanic. So this is an image that is supposed to represent sexual desire. But as you can see, there's some demonic qualities to it. you can see sort of like the evil eyes and laughter of the people involved. Does that make sense to you guys? This is Jens Stien, one of the most famous painters of this time. So as you can see, there are a lot of paintings that follow these themes. At the same time, you have also the pictures of what it means to be a good middle-class household. So as you can see, these paintings are ones of simplicity, ones of restraint, ones of temperance, ones of prudence, okay? So within these paintings captures a lot of middle class Christian values, all right? This is another representation, all right? So you can see the simple Calvinist work ethic being depicted in this picture. This is Rembrandt, who is the most famous painter from this period. Rembrandt. This is probably the prototypical portrait of a wealthy person in the Dutch Republic. She's wealthy, but the most important thing is for you to understand, she's simple. She's not luxurious and decadent like the Spanish are. She is very restrained. She's very focused. She's very temperate in her behavior. because she represents the quintessential wealthy middle class woman. All right, so now let's discuss why the Dutch are buying these paintings. The question then is why is there an art market? What's the purpose of an art market? And so there are different reasons. Well, the first major reason is to show that you're refined, to engage in beauty, to show you have taste. the first reason. Second reason is because of the Calvinist religion, the money no longer goes to churches. Churches are meant to be simple. If you go into a Catholic church, it's luxurious, it's golden. If you go into a Calvinist church, it's very simple. So now people are transferring their wealth from the temple into the household in order to better worship God. So a lot of these paintings are religious in nature because they're trying to turn the houses into churches. A second reason. The third reason is the idea of conspicuous consumption, conspicuous consumption, to enjoy your wealth and to show your wealth off to your neighbors. So when you invite people off to dinner parties, they can see how wonderful your artwork is. Nostalgia is you are thinking about classical Greece, classical Rome, and another reason is meditation, okay? And so we talked about this where the middle class, they're always afraid of becoming poor, okay? So what they do is they freeze their anxiety, competition, and uncertainty in a contemplative whole. They take their anxiety and they project it onto the painting in order to better meditate on the idea of what it means to be middle class. Does that make sense? But there are other three more reasons which are more important for us. These three reasons are the representation of the other, taboos and boundaries. So as you can see, the paintings of the poor represent the poor as lazy, excessive, and violent. Always giving in to their sexual urges. And so they're trying to create the idea of the other. The poor are the other that we must at all times avoid. Second reason is transference. So you have all these desires to eat good food, to engage in sex that you cannot do because of your religion. So you transfer these feelings onto the artwork itself. So the artwork itself becomes the subject of your desire. Does that make sense, guys? That's the second major reason. The third major reason is just simply hypocrisy. The artwork is a shield, it's an armor, it's a dress for you to show that you have good values. So these are the three more nefarious reasons why dark becomes popular. And guess what, guys? They're still true today. These are still the reasons what drives culture today, including literature, movies, artwork. And so in every age, you, sorry, sorry. So let's now just summarize what we've learned. So the Italian Renaissance, you have great artwork from the Italian Renaissance, you have great artwork from the Dutch Golden Age. What are the three differences? Well, the first major difference is the Italian Renaissance, It's patronized by the wealthy people. And as such, they're trying to have nostalgia for the past. That's why a lot of paintings are of classical Greek and Roman individuals and historical and history. And the art is meant to be celebrated by the community. That's why they're hung up in churches or public places or in the Vatican. Does that make sense? That's the main idea of Italian restaurants. When we get to the Dutch-Gorean age, it's pigeonized mainly by the middle class who are interested in depicting the present in the here and now. And they're only interested in their individual contemplation with the art, okay? Their individual communication and dialogue with the art itself. And this will give rise to the modern art market. Right? Any questions before I move on? All right. So to summarize, art is a response to the anxiety, uncertainty, and compendence of middle class life. It's still true today. Art encapsulates the alienation of the individual. And that's still true today. That's what art is. This is happening because there's certain pathologies to middle class life that's still true today. The first pathology is middle class identity demands the control regulation of yourself and other people. But why? Because you have a fear of disorder. So we discuss this where middle class life is competitive, it's anxious, it's uncertain. So this creates pathologies within you. And how do these pathologies express themselves? Well, through a fear of disorder. But you also have a fear of germs, cleanliness. The middle class is obsessed with cleaning this. That's why the middle class, if you just mentioned the idea of infectious diseases, germs, they just run away. They're really afraid of the idea of infectious diseases. The last is, sorry, it's a fear of loss. Sorry, this is wrong. It's a fear of loss. So the middle class is also obsessed accumulation of achievement. And if you think about it, this explains why Chinese parents are so obsessed with getting their kids into good universities, the Ivy League, because of regulation of yourself, cleanliness, and accumulation of achievement. So there's no logical reason why your kid must get into the Ivy League. You can't explain to me through peer analysis, peer reason, peer logic, why it's important to get your kid into IV leak. It doesn't really benefit you or the kid. In fact, I personally believe that getting IV leak will actually hurt and hamper your life's chances for success. But if you think about the pathology of the middle class, what it means to be in the middle class, the fact that they're uncertain and anxious, and getting the kid into IV leak is a way to relieve their anxiety. their OCD, then it makes sense. Okay? All right? All right. So now I will conclude by talking about who I think is the greatest artist of the Dutch Golden Age. And his name is Johann Vermeer. Okay? In every age, in every movement, you emerge a great artist who subverts the movement, who shows you the pathologies, the problems, the ironies, the paradoxes within this movement. So what Johann Vermeer is really good at doing in his artwork is demonstrating to us the hypocrisy of middle-class life. So this is one of his most famous paintings called View from the Deaf. Guys, this was painted about 1650. I have no idea how he did this. No one has an idea how he did this. The lighting is perfect. It's like you had a camera, like an iPhone, and he stopped a picture of his city. It's perfect. The lighting is absolutely perfect. How was he able to do this? And so my only explanation, and again, it's my theory, is what makes great artists different is they're able to dissolve their ego. They're able to dissolve their body, and their soul becomes part of the moment. It doesn't make sense. So in other words, what Vermeer did is he became the painting itself. The painting became him, and then he became the painting. And what he's doing right now, he is just expressing his soul. Okay? So that's my theory. All right, this is his most famous painting, okay? I'm sure you guys have seen this. girl with the pearl airing, right? This is a beautiful painting, but I will show you some problems or some ironies in this painting. Obviously, this pearl airing is a problem because she's an ordinary person, right? She's maybe a maid, she's a young person. She's poor. Why would she have an pearl airing which is extremely precious, extremely valuable, extremely expensive, okay? That's a question. That's the paradox or mystery within this painting. Then this gives this leads to the question, why is she looking at us seductively, right? She's looking at us with like desire, with yearning. And then you recognize, well, she probably has a master, a patron, right? She's probably working in a household. And maybe there's a sort of relationship of sorts between the maid and the husband. Okay? And so it's a story, it's a novel that draws in your imagination. But more importantly, it shows you the hypocrisy within middle class life. These entire purpose of prostitutes is so that the husband will not do this crap at home, right? Because it's important to maintain the sanity of the middle class household. It's your temple of worship. So you're not allowed to seduce your servants. So this is actually subversive painting that at the same time seduces us. It almost begs us to do the same thing. It's trying to demonstrate our own sexual depravity and our own sexual desires. It shows us the relationship between sex and power. Doesn't make sense, guys. This is the milkmaid. another really famous painting. Again, and I have no idea how he does, but the lighting is perfect. The lighting is absolutely perfect. Not only that, but the lighting is able to highlight the blemishes of the wall, right? So he could have just made the wall white, but instead he's showing us the cracks, the blemishes within the wall, which is a metaphor for the blemishes and the cracks within middle class, towards her real life. All right? Now, when you first look at it, you think, oh, this is a picture of middle class, simplicity, and hard work. All right? She's a virtuous, faithful, young woman who's hardy, who's dedicated to her work, okay? But then you focus on this, right? And there's sexual qualities to this, which is a center of the picture. It's almost like she's peeing or this, I mean use your imagination, okay? Do you understand? All right? So within this wholesome picture is embedded a picture of sexual possibilities. Doesn't make sense guys. Okay? And the idea here is it's meant to be subversive. It's meant to make you uncomfortable, right? You guys laugh a bit, but if you're middle class person, you have this painting in your house, you're a bit disturbed by what you see. All right? All right, another really famous painting by Vermeer. Interesting is we are sneaking in, right? We are looking in. We're spying into the scene. And that's what Vermeer is saying is, that's what the middle class do. The middle class are afraid of participating, but they love spying. They love peering. They love peeking into the taboo and the forbidden. That's why we have art, to peer into the forbidden. And as you can see, the painter and the model, there's a bit of a sexual energy between the two. And that's what excites us. That's why we're peeking into the scene. We're hiding ourselves behind the curtain and we're trying to capture the sexual possibilities between the two. Okay? Doesn't make sense, guys. So these ideas, that middle class life, it's inherently flawed. They're blemishes, they're cracks behind the veneer. It's fundamentally hypocritical. It gets captured in literature later on. First Madame Bovary. Okay? And the most famously, the most famous novel of all time, Anna Karina, that middle class life, it's fundamentally hypocritical. So on the surface, it seems, Anna Karina, she married a very faithful, very loving husband, and then she betrayed him to have this affair that destroys entire families. On the surface, it shows you the importance of maintaining the sanctity of middle class life, of maintaining rules and order. Because if you don't do so, it will lead to disaster and hard work. But at the same time, you read this novel very closely. It's about 1,000 pages, by the way. It also shows you the hypocrisy of middle class life, how Anna Karina herself has been oppressed by the taboos and the boundaries set upon her by the world that she lives in. And this is what's going to drive literature from now on. Okay, that's it, okay? So in next class, we will do the rise of England, all right? But it's important that we remember that the British Empire, a lot of the ideas of the British Empire are now being seated in the Dutch Republic, including the idea of multinational corporations, including the idea of capitalism, including the idea of middle class life, okay? Including the idea of artwork and literature. Okay, any questions about today? Okay, so in next class, will do the rest of England."}

It's really a way to attempt to control the narrative Now, as you know, the Iranians have responded to the American bombing. The Iranians notify the Americans that they would send missiles against US bases, empty US bases, in Qatar. And that seemed to be the full extent of the Iranian retaliation. Donald Trump was very pleased with his very tibid response. And many of you might be wondering, why was the reigning response so tippet tippet and so muted? And there's a lot of speculation online. And so what I'll do is I'll offer you my explanation. If you fully commit to war, why would you launch such a tippet response to U.S. aggression? Well, the main reason is you want to infuriate your population. So let me explain what I mean. Livy, the Roman historian, he wrote the history of the Roman Republic, and he wrote about one incident where a Roman legion went off to a frontier. And the natives confined them and they were outnumbered, so the Roman legion built fortifications. And every day, the natives would come and taunt the Roman soldiers. And at this point, the Roman soldiers really wanted to go out and fight the natives. But the commanders refused. The commanders ordered them to show restraint and to maintain defense. And as a result, the natives thought that the Romans were cowards. And so the taunt became worse and worse. And it became so bad that the Roman soldiers were about to mutiny. And at this point the commanders agreed for the Roman legion to attack the natives and the Roman legion were so angry and so infuriated and so insulted that they slaughtered the natives. So that's what's happening in Iran today. The Iranian people are clearly insulted and humiliated by this U.S. bombing. And the Iranian government is holding them back, which even makes them more angry. And as U.S. aggression, as Israeli aggression increases, the Iranian response will become more and more tippant, more and more mute, and thus angering the population to the extent that the population will force the Iranian regime to declare war on the United States and Israel. So that's the game plan moving forward. So I would think that over the next month things will be a bit quiet. There's certainly a lot of incidents. So the Chinese media is reporting that the Iranian intelligence agency has uncovered an Israeli false flag operation in the United States. So over the next couple of weeks, we will still see some news regarding the Middle East. But I expect things to stay quiet for now. So I will use this opportunity to provide you some important background as to what's going on in the Middle East. So last video I mentioned that there are certain elements within the American Empire that want America to lose a war against Iran in the Middle East and they want Israel to become the empire of the Middle East and these people these elements are called Christian Zionists And so I want to today explain to you where Christian Zionism is and how it fits into this war in the Middle East. So the tenable term for Christian Zionism is pre-millennial dispensationless. So it's a very hard term but I'm going to explain what it means. And by the way I will explain a lot of new terms in in this video. So I will provide wiki links and some background reading in the description below. So please check the description if you want to further understanding of the terms I introduced today. So pre-millennial dispensationalism is pre-millennialist understanding that when Jesus returns, he will initiate a thousand years of peace in the world called the Messianic Age. That's why we have the term pre-millennial, because when Jesus returns, we will have 1,000 years of peace. Disciplesationalists is the understanding that the world history is divided into certain stages. In each stage, the relationship between God and humans change. And we are now approaching the final stage, which is the full reconciliation with God through the second coming of Jesus. But for this second coming to happen, certain elements need to be in place. The first major element is that Israel needs to be, we constitute it as a nation, which has already happened in 1948. Then all the Jews from around the world have to return to Israel. And then they have to destroy the Dome of the Rock, which is the third oldest site in Islamic tradition, and build the third temple. Then there has to be a war of Gog and Magog when Israel is besieged by a fierce enemy. And then this will lead to Agamemna, sorry, Arga Magethan, which is the final battle. And at the very last minute, when all hope is lost, when Israel is about to be defeated, Jesus will return and he will initiate the Mesoenic Age. He will save Israel and he will initiate the Mesoenic Age. If you're a Christian upon Jesus' return, you will be immediately sent to heaven. This is called the rapture. So that's the idea of Christian Zionism. And Christian Zionism, as I explained before, is one of the main drivers of this war in the Middle East. And if Christian Zionists have their way, then certain things will happen, okay? The most important thing that must happen is the United States sending ground troops against Iran. Because as I mentioned, if the United States were to send ground troops into Iran, the American Empire would fall. And which will give birth to the Empire of Israel. This is important because in the Christian Zionist framework, America is not involved in this prophecy. So you need to take America out of this equation somehow. So that's the first thing that must happen. Second thing that must happen is that the Dorm of the Rock must be destroyed. If the Dorm of the Rock were destroyed, the Jews could rebuild the Third Temple. But more importantly, it would unify the Islamic world against Israel, thus initiating the War of Gog and Nagog. Another thing that must happen is the Jews must return to Israel. And right now, most Jews are living very nice lives in the Western world. So why would they want to return to Israel? Well, the answer is America has been defeated in Iran and Americans are pissed about this loss. And so who do they blame? Who do they persecute? Who will be the scapegoats? And so you have this global surge of anti-Semitism. And so now you have major Jewish intellectuals coming out and say, listen, we should all return to Israel because that's where we'll most be safe. So if I'm correct in believing that Christian Zionism is a very powerful force in the world, then these three things will happen over the next few years. A US-grown invasion of Iran, the Dome of the Rock will be destroyed somehow, I don't know how. And the third thing is a movement to return Jews to Israel. So why is Christian Zionism so strong? Well, what I will show you today is Christian Zionism is embedded into the very foundations of the Anglo-American Empire. It's been there since the beginning and it's been this is the beginning thanks to the contributions of one man, Isaac Newton. So let me tell you about Isaac Newton and then you will better understand how Christian Zionism came to being and how it influenced the Anglo-American empire. Isaac Newton as you know was probably the most fluent man who ever lived. He was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. He was born into a common family. His family was not nobility, not royalty, very common. His father died when he was very young and his mother remarried and essentially abandoned Newton. But Newton was extremely gifted student and he eventually got a scholarship to study Cambridge University where he began to make the major contributions to the development of science. He made major contributions to optics. He invented calculus. He discovered the three laws of of planetary motion, which proved conclusively, once and for all, that our solar system was helocentric as opposed to geocentric. In many ways, Newton embodied the sonic revolution. When he died, he was given a state funeral. Only the second person in Buddhist history at that time who was non-routy to be given a state funeral. And he was one of the only scientists to be given a state funeral. And even today, the British remember Isaac Newton as the most brilliant Englishman who ever lived. But there are three things that you may not know about Isaac Newton. And once I explain these three things, then you have a much more complete understanding of this great man. The first thing that you probably don't know about him is that he was fascinated by the occult. He was a major practitioner of the occult, mainly alchemy. So Newton spent most of his life in search of a philosopher's stone. Because the philosopher's stone promised the elixir of immortality, which would grant immortality. It also promised to turn lead into gold. And Newton was positive that existed. So he spent most of his life in search of it. We know about this because in the 1930s, the economist John Maynard Keynes, he bought Newton's papers in an auction, and he really believed that within these papers, he would discover mathematical secrets of the universe. Instead, what he discovered was all this religious gibberish from Newton. Newton spent most of his life studying the Bible and trying to figure out the divine messages embedded in the Bible. So if you were asked, Newton, like, what is your profession? Newton would never say he was a scientist or a philosopher. He would say first and foremost He was a theologian. He was most interested in discovering the mind of God. And that's why he dealt with his mathematical and physical systems in order to better decipher the mind of God. Okay, so let me give you an example of this. At this time in history, most Christians understood that history was theological. Teological comes from the Greek telos, which means purpose. So history is moving towards the end, which is second coming of Christ. Newton's great insight was to understand that if history is indeed theological, then it has structure and order, and therefore it can be expressed mathematically. And so if you can figure out the mathematical underpinnings of the world, then you've proven that history is theological, and therefore you've proven that God exists. Newton's three laws of motions, right? Let's summarize, there's three laws of motion. Number one, things that are rest stay at rest. Number two, force equals mass times acceleration. Number three, for every action, there must be an equal reaction. Okay, so what people don't understand is these three laws are not fiscal laws, they are first and foremost an ontological argument which proves existence of God. So the first law, things that are a rest, must stay at rest. Okay, so we can imagine that at the beginning of time, everything was at rest. If everything's at rest, it can't move by itself according to the first law. Therefore, something must have moved things to put things in motion. And this is what Aristotle calls the prime mover. Second and third law implies that there's a structure and order and purpose to the universe and who designed the structure, order and purpose. It must be God, okay? So what's interesting is that these three laws of motion, they prove that God exists, but much more importantly, they are the basis for a new religion, a new religious movement called deism. And deism is important because deism is the main religion of the founding fathers of America, okay? So having proven that God in fact does exist, Newton's next step is what does God want? What is God's purpose? Well, for him, it was easy. To understand God's purpose, read the Bible. So Newton would spend decades reading the Bible and trying to imagine its mathematical underpinnings. For him, every sentence was a mathematical formula. and he was trying to take the Bible and compare and contrast it with history. And he wrote a book, it was not published in his lifetime, but it was published after his death. It was called Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John. And it's something you have to look at, okay? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a link down in the description below, which will, and you can read it online for free. Okay. So this is a major work and it's a foundational text for Christian Zionism because it argues, first of all, that history is theological, that God has a purpose. And second of all, this is really important. The Bible is literal. Okay. So even though Daniel and John were different people, they both as prophets spoke the mind of God. They were divine inspired and so what did they wrote came from God himself. So by examining their prophecies, you are deciphering God's purpose for humanity. And this is the foundation for Christian Zionism. So that's the first thing you need to understand about Newton, that he was first and foremost a theologian and not a scientist. Second thing that you must understand about Newton is that he was a member of secret societies in England at that time. Now today when we think of secret societies, we think of nefarious underground conspiracies. But at that time, secret societies were actually very common and very well accepted. Secret societies were platforms for men of education, of wealth and of status to get together to engage in religious speculation outside the purview of the Anglican church. At that time, the Anglican church had an orthodoxy And by law, you cannot transgress against this orthodoxy. So for example, Newton got into a lot of trouble during his lifetime because he did not leave in the Holy Trinity. He thought that Jesus was not co-equal to God. He thought that Jesus was subordinate to God. And this was a heresy at that time. So Newton got in a lot of trouble, but he had powerful friends, powerful backers. and so they bailed them out from the church authorities. So these societies were platform for people to discuss religious matters. They also had the origins from the Knights Templars. The Knights Templars during the Crusades were in Jerusalem and because they were in Jerusalem, they could engage in world religions like Zoroastrianism like Judaism, like paganism. And as such, they, and because these were extremely watch-coded men with deep intellectual curiosity, they collected all the secret teachings that they were exposed to in Jerusalem and they brought it back to them in Europe. And so they ran a fowl of the Catholic Church which outlawed them eventually. But their teachings went underground and they became embedded in these secret societies. So when Newton joined these secret societies and when he was able to discover the laws of the universe, well, I imagine that these men celebrate Newton as a prophet, as a masaya, as a chosen one, as someone who would reveal the secret teachings of God to the world. And because the world was not ready for these teachings, then they would make it their mission to keep it secret and wait for the day when they could reveal these teachings to the world. So, Newton's teachings that God's a purpose, and this purpose is literally embedded into the Bible. And this purpose will lead to Second Coming of God of Christ. It now becomes the framework for the secret societies and as they spread to America it becomes embedded in the secret societies of America as well and guess who are members of the secret societies, the founding fathers of America. So that's something you need to know about Newton, that he was a member of the secret societies who celebrated him and who treated his theological understandings as the word of God. Okay. And the third thing that you have to understand about Newton is for 30 years, he was master of the world myth. And he was, and he was, his purpose was to maintain the sanity, the value, and the credibility of royal coinage against counterfeiters. And so the deal with counterfeiters, he set up a network of spies to identify these counterfeiters, sometimes to torture them for information, and for the most egregious offenders, they'll be executed. So in other words, Newton established England's very first intelligence agency, Intelligence apparatus. In 1965, the United States Treasury Department established a secret service. What's your job? The job was to identify counterfeiters. Why would they call it a secret service? Because the Treasury Department didn't want people to know they existed because they existed. It meant that counterfeiting was a huge problem in America, which, which it was at that time, which it still is today. And so that would undermine the credibility of the currency. Okay. So, um, so Newton had his own intelligence agency. So in many ways, Newton built the foundations of the British Empire, which eventually became the Anglo-American Empire, which controls the world today. And so let's summarize, and I'll give you three takeaways from today's talk. I want you to remember, okay? The first takeaway is, because Isaac Newton saw himself as a prophet, because he was convinced that only through divine favor could he arise from being a poor, abandoned child to becoming one of the leading intellectuals of British society, the leading scientist of British society. It could only be through divine favor. They needed a mission to spread God's message. that message will become the foundations of Christian Zionism. So Christian Zionism is embedded into the very fabric, the very foundation of the Anglo-American Empire. Okay, that's the first major takeaway. Second major takeaway is Israel is a creation of the Anglo-American Empire. Zionism is a creation of Christian Zionism, which leads us to the third takeaway. Judaism and Zionism are not the same thing. Christian Zionism and Judaism are in fundamental conflict. Let me explain why. The people who are most opposed to the creation of the state of Israel are Orthodox Jews. Because in their tradition, in their religion, the plan is for God to send a Messiah, anointed one who will lead the Jewish people. And this Messiah will bring the Jews back to the promised land, create the nation of Israel, build the third temple, and create the Messianic Age. The Jews don't know who this Messiah is, and they don't know when he will come, and so they must be patient of faith in God. Christian Zionism is an attempt to manipulate history, manipulate God to force the second coming of Jesus. In the mind of Christian Zionists, if the nation of Israel is reconstituted, if all the Jews return to Israel, if the third temple is built, if there's a war of Gog and Magog, then Jesus is is forced to return. They will force the hand of God and create the Mesoedic age. So for Orthodox Jews, this is a blasphemy. This is counterfeiting. This is stealing their religion. And that's why Orthodox Jews are most opposed to the state of Israel. So I know this was an extremely controversial, very confusing talk. So what I'll do again is I will, in the description below, put all the links and the references you will need to truly understand Christian Zionism. So please look at Newton's book, observations upon the prophecies of Daniel and the populace of St. John. Please look at the Schofield Bible, which frames the Bible in the lens of Christian Zionism. And please look at Wiki entries for Christian Zionism, pre-millennial dispensationalism, Newton. Okay, so if you really want to understand what's going on in the Middle East, then you really need to get a good handle on these ideas. I'm sure this talk has raised a lot of questions for you. Some of you like why is Christian Zionism so powerful? Some of you may disagree and say what's driving this war in the Middle East is not Christian Zionism, it's international finance, it's a sea of London, it's the Great Reset, it's American Empire. So what I would do in my next talk is explain to you these things are not mutually exclusive, they're all one thing. And you can make the argument that they are one big conspiracy. And the only people who don't know that this is a great conspiracy are the conspirators themselves. Okay, I will in my next talk, I will just gain theory to explain to you what's going on. And when I do, then things will be extremely clear to you as to why Christian Zionism is able to drive the history of the Middle East. What I'll also show you in my next talk is that Christian Zionism, what's happened in the Middle East? It's happened before and it will happen again. So 1500 years ago in the Middle East, it seemed as though biblical prophecy was about to be fulfilled. The world was at war against each other. Empires were fighting over Jerusalem and millions were dying. The world seemed to be ending. It really seemed the end of history. And at this time the Jews were praying for the Messiah. And they really believed the Messiah had come to them. A man came and they really believed he was the anointed one. and he was able to rally not just the Jews, but everyone around him. He was so charismatic and it really seemed as though the men's age would come and these Jews were willing to die for him. That's how much they believed in him. This man's name, well actually we don't know this man's name but today Today we've referred to this man as Mohammed, okay? Mohammed was the Messiah of the Jews. So in my next video I will explain to you how this came about. Just a quick announcement. I want to thank everyone for subscribing to my channel. I'm really flattered by all the attention. But I'm not really set up for this. summer I was I brought my two kids back to Toronto and I and I'm every day I'm from like 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. I take them outside to play so I really don't have that much time to make these videos but at the same time I want to do the best possible job in presenting really interesting perspectives to you about what's going on in the world today. If you if you spend the time to watch my videos and I have an obligation to make sure these videos are insightful for you. So I'm going to need more time to spend on these videos. So I'm sorry, but I might have to take a pause for about two weeks in order to really delve deep into the research necessary in order to create the next video. But if this war in the Middle East breaks out again for whatever reason, I don't think it will, but if it breaks out for whatever reason, then rest assured I will make a video helping you analyze what's going on and giving you some insight as to why this is happening and where things might be going. Okay, so thanks so much for watching. I really appreciate it and I will see you next time."}
{"video_id": "KSSSCznYrGo", "title": "Civilization #18:  The Great Pyramid as Ancient Egypt's Manhattan Project", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSSCznYrGo", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 3272.8603125, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 6593, "text": "So this will be a fun class today. We are doing the Great Pyramid. Okay so the Great Pyramid was built about 2500 BCE, that's 45 years ago, by a pharaoh named Curfew and it was one of the seven great wonders of the ancient world, it's the only one that's still standing. From 2500 until 1400 CE, which is about 4,000 years, it was the tallest man-made building in the world. Okay? Great pyramid. The direction is to north, meaning you can actually use the pyramids as a compass to tell the directions. Let's look at the architecture of the Great Pyramid. So the center is something called the King's Chamber. That's where the King's Mummy rests in the sarcophagus. There's a grand gallery that gives you access to the King's Chamber and then a slope and then it's a pyramid structure and on top of the pyramid is what is called the Bende, or the Pyro-Edeon, the Pyro-Edeon. And it is extremely significant culturally and religiously in Egypt, because in Egyptian mythology, the religion, the creator god Atum, he's known as Atum. He's also known as Rathasangod. First came into existence on the Bende. So imagine a large dark ocean and there's nothing. And then suddenly emerges a mound called a bended. And that's where comes the critical atum or raw. Okay, that's one legend. The legend is from the dark ocean of space comes down a bended and on top of it rests atum. So this idea of the primordian, the Ben-Ben, it is central to the idea of creation in Egyptian mythology. So this is an extremely powerful and beautiful monument to Egyptian culture. Architecturally, Napoleon who visited the Great Pyramid, he calculated that if you You took all the stones from the Great Pyramid, you could actually build a wall around the perimeter of France. There's more material in the Great Pyramid except for two structures. The first structure is Great Wall of China. There's more stone in the Great Wall of China, okay? There's more stone, there's more material in the Three Gorges Dam also in China, okay? And it took them about 26 years to build this pyramid. pyramid. So today in today's class I'm going to look at three questions. The first question is how do they build this? Because it's still with us today. You can actually go to Egypt and visit the great pyramid. The second question is why do they build this? What was the purpose? And the third question is why do they stop building the pyramids? Okay, so those are three questions we're looking at today. How was it built? Why was it built? And why did the Egyptians stop building the pyramids? So how it was built is an extremely controversial question that has plagued historians and Egyptologists and archaeologists for hundreds of years. And originally a Greek historian by the name of Herodotus proposed the idea the pyramid was built in steps. Okay, so it was first a step pyramid and then using polis they pull the stones up. Okay, and it was the accepted idea for the longest time. It was there's no better idea. But architecturally that has been disproven. Okay, it can't work that way. Then about ten years ago there was a French architect named John Pierre Houdin. Okay, H-O-U-D-I-N, Houdin. And he's an architect. He's never been to Egypt, doesn't speak Arabic, never studied Egypt, but his father and him were very interested in how the Great Pyramid was constructed. So he came up with this theory and they've run computer simulations and discovered this to be true. There's also a lot of physical evidence to suggest this theory is true. Okay, so this is how they built the Great Pyramid. What they did was they first constructed an external ramp in order to build a base. So you would now have the base. And then from the base, what they did was they built two structures. And this is what they call counterweights. So these counterweights are like polies, which allows them to pull the stones up to up high. And then surrounding these two structures is what they call a eternal spiral lamp, a ramp, okay? To carry the stones up. And so what they did was they basically built the pyramids from the inside out. And then once they built the structure, they covered it up with limestone so that it reflects in the sun. If you actually were living back then and you saw the pyramids from a distance, you would think it was the star that has come down on the planet Earth. Okay? So that's how they built the pyramid. But then this raises another interesting question is, how they come up with this plan? And how were they able to do this without blueprints and without basically writing or modern engineering techniques? And the answer is, if you think about it, And what they did was they built a model right beside the pyramid, which allowed them to figure out how to build the larger pyramid. But it's still believed this was not possible because they believe that Egyptians have the intellectual capacity to imagine this to be true. And I'll show you later on that they actually did, that we underestimate their imagination in their intellectual capacity. So that answers the first question pretty easily, how's it built? A more controversial question is, why was it built? And for the longest time, the accepted theory is, this is a tomb, a tomb. The reason why is, Egyptians believed in the afterlife. And so the theory is, this pyramid is designed to ease the pharaoh's transition into the heavens where he would become a star or a sun. And so the common phrase is, this is almost a resurrection machine where the pharaoh goes up to the sky and then after a few centuries, he reincarnates inside the pyramid. And the structure is meant to accomplish this. And again, this is the generally accepted theory today. But there are three major problems with this theory, which basically makes it, which basically discounts it. The first major problem is there are about 100 pyramids in Egypt, 100 or more. We don't know. We have not found a mummy or a body inside any sarcophagus inside the pyramids. So this is a problem. If this is a tomb, why is there no body? We can't find the body. So that's one problem. Second problem is this. For this to be a tomb, this implies that the pharaohs are divine. They are basically the emanation of God on Earth. This means that when they come to the planet Earth and they become the pharaoh, their priority is to build their own tomb, right? Does that make any sense? They come to Earth and they're like, okay, well, I'm gonna die. So I want to get out of here as soon as possible, so let's build that tomb, right? Now, the problem is that this would imply that the Pharaoh sees the Egyptian people as his slaves, you exist in order for me to live. And so, but the problem is that, that in Egyptian mythology, gods are considered benefactors of the human race. Okay, so for example, Atum Ra, he is the one who gave life to the world, but then his son, his descendant Osiris, another god, gave civilization to Egypt. And then Horus, the son of Osiris, gave the institution of kingship to Egypt. Okay, so these gods come to Earth in order to help the human race develop in some capacity. So it doesn't make any sense that the Pharaoh's primary purpose when he's on Earth is to create a tomb because that's a very selfish reason. Does that make sense? And the third problem with this is just pure logic. If you're a Pharaoh and your primary concern is the afterlife resurrecting yourself and the pyramid is a primary means of accomplishing this, and it takes about 26 years or 30 years to build a pyramid, how can you be sure that you won't die before the pyramid is built? That's a problem. So these are three logical problems. But again, each etiologist insists that it is a tomb, primarily because of the way that Egyptians understand the afterlife. So here's some evidence to suggest it is a tool. This is considered a writing of a feral to his son about what the pyramid represents. So this is what he says, make your grave well furnished and prepare thy place in the West. The West is where they go off to die. Look, death counts little for us. We can conquer death. Look, life is valued highly by us. We want to become immortal. The house of the dead, meaning the tomb, is for life. So the pyramid is what will make us immortal. So this is, again, highly debated today. So largely speaking, it doesn't make sense that the pyramids are a tomb, but there's a lot of evidence suggests it is a tomb. And because of this debate, different theories happen proposed as to the purpose of the pyramid. And there are lots of really strange theories out there. lots of really strange theories. One really interesting theory was proposed by a man named Nikola Tesla, the creator of electricity, basically. And his idea was this. He studied the architecture of the pyramid and he proposed the pyramid was a battery system, okay? In order to create free, sorry, to create free, clean energy. And the theory is this. The theory is, first of all, if you look at the King's chamber, the sound frequency in it is F sharp. And F sharp is also the frequency of the planet Earth. So it seems like the pyramid is a tune to the planet Earth. Second of all, if you look at where the pyramids are geographically, it's too north. It's put in a place that matches the directions of the Earth. And so the theory is the direction of the pyramid is capturing the energy from the electromagnetic field that the Earth generates. And the third explanation is inside the pyramid are granite stones and outside are limestones. And this is a perfect way to trap and store energy. So think of a solar panel where the sun and the moon reflects light onto the pyramids and the energy is stored inside the pyramid. Okay? And so this is a great theory. And again, there are lots of people who believe in this Because this is actually much more plausible than the tomb theory. But the problem with this, of course, is it doesn't work scientifically. And also, you have the question of, if they produce all this free clean energy, what are they using it for? So this leads us with a big question. Why did they build the Great Pyramid? And today, I want to propose to you another solution. The solution is this. My belief is the Great Pyramid was designed as Egypt's Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project, as you know, was a World War II project in order to build the nuclear bomb. And you can argue, nuclear bomb is humanity's greatest invention ever. It took about 130,000 people over five to six years working in the United States, in Canada, in UK. And these are the best scientists in the world at this time, okay? Working collectively in order to create the nuclear bomb. And you can also make the argument that there are many working on a project who believe the Manhattan Project was about bringing peace to earth, eternal peace. It was ultimately about mastering the secrets of the universe, channeling the power of God in order to create eternal peace, to bring God on earth. And you'd also argue that because we've had no major war after World War II, fingers crossed, they were right. Okay? So that's my argument to you. The Egyptians conceptualized and created the Great Pyramid in order to harness the power of God in order to create eternal peace on earth. to bring an end to history, to bring an end to pain, suffering, and death. So before I provide the evidence, let me explain this theory in general. And again, this is my theory, it's speculation, it's imagination, but I think it makes sense. So let me explain the theory to you. The trick is the body of the feral, the mummy. Now if the feral was divine, and his users believed he was divine, then after his death, the body would be sacred and divine. Right? But knowing that, when you think about it, after the Pharaoh dies, he would ascend to the heavens and become a star or a son. Right? The body then becomes a portal or a mechanism for you to communicate with the Pharaoh while he's in the heavens. You could also argue the body, the mummy, could be a mechanism for you to channel the pharaoh's powers on Earth. So imagine this. Yeah, this is a sarcophagus. The mummy is inside. And then you have the grand gallery. And inside the grand gallery, what are people doing? They are there praying and worshiping the pharaoh, which then draws the energy from the stars onto the Earth. And then because of the limestone, this energy is reflected across Egypt. So the entire nation can bask in the divine energy of the pharaoh. So Nikola Tesla said that this was a battery in order to channel free clean energy to power Egypt. Well, what if it changes to divine energy instead? The pyramid was a battery to channel divine energy in order to power Egypt. Now let me discuss if you are a worshipper in the Grand Gallery, what are you experiencing? Well, first of all, you're experiencing the collision, the nexus of life and death, right? Because the Pharaoh, he's dead, but he's still alive through your faith. Even though you're mortal, you are now a communication of a God, okay? So this is a nexus of life and death. This grand channel, sorry, this grand gallery, if you actually have such visit, it in Egypt, okay? You'll recognize that this almost looks like a womb. So it's almost like you're inside a dark space that's taking you back to the point of your birth. But it's also you can also be seen as a tomb, a place where you're being buried. So this is also like another collision or conflation, or nexus of being born and dying. If you were outside and you just saw the pyramid, Again, you would think of it as a star that has landed on earth, right? So this is a conflation, a nexus of heaven and earth. It's a collision, a nexus of myth and reality. You can also make the argument that through divine worship, what you're really doing is you're reversing the great bang, sorry, the big bang. You're reversing the big bang. You bring it into this one space. and you are creating oneness, wholeness, and completeness. You have achieved the union and the unity of all things through your faith in the Pharaoh, which gives you divine energy to be born a new clans of your sins and to cleanse others of their sins to create a moral Egypt, okay? Doesn't make sense, all right? So that's a theory. So now let me explain the idea of eternal peace. Why would the pyramid create the idea of eternal peace? Well, the first reason is, even though Egypt was a empire dynasty at this point, it was still divided culturally. There were at least four different cultures scattered around Egypt. And they all had their own mythologies, They had all their own religious practices. They had their own faiths. So the point of this pyramid was to unite all these faiths into one singular object in the worship of the Pharaoh. If you were an Egyptian citizen, if you were in Egypt, and you looked at the pyramid, you could not help but think, this is God on earth. This centers your faith, and it forces your obedience and your submission to higher authority, which is a thorough. That's the first reason, unity. Second is the idea of awe. So let's just say you're a powerful army and you're an enemy and you want to conquer Egypt. Well, you send your scouts to Egypt and they see the pyramids, right? The great pyramid. What are they seeing? They're seeing God on earth. Okay. So you're not going to attack God on earth. You're going to run away. So it creates a sense of all around the world. The last thing is the domination of nature. So through divine inspiration, Egypt is able to summon the Great Pyramid. This shows the God's ability to control nature. Why is this important? Because the source of Egyptian wealth and power is the Nile River. The Nile River. And basically it's the Nile River that has made Egypt the wealthiest country in the world for thousands of years. Okay? So the thing about the Nile is, if it's in a good mood, you live a very good life because the Nile just floods, just floods of banks and leaves this rich soil, and then you just pour some seeds in it, and then you can grow all these crops very easily. Okay? Very, it's very easy life, and you can become very wealthy that way. So if it's a good mood, then you are a very happy person. But if it's in a bad mood, for example, it doesn't flood or it floods too much, you could die of salvation or of drowning. So it's very important for you to be able to control the moods of the gods. And that's what the pyramid is meant to do. The Egyptian word for Egypt is kemet, which basically means black earth. So the source of all life in Egypt is the soil, the black earth. So let's go back to this quotation. And now we can actually understand it in a different way. Make your grave well furnished and prepare thy place in the west, that's fine. Now look, death counts little for us. We're gods, we're pharaohs, we will never die so we don't worry about death. We're not to worry about dying. Look, life is very highly biased. What is life? Life are humans, the Egyptian people. Our concern as Pharaohs is for the well-being of the Egyptian people. So that's our primary responsibility. The house of the dead, the pyramid, is for life. The pyramid is our legacy to the Egyptian people. It is our benevolence. It is our generosity. It is how we will make Egypt eternal and stable and prosperous. So that's my theory of what the pyramid is. It is really the Manhattan Project, an attempt by the pharaoh to bring eternal peace. Any questions about this idea before I elaborate on it and present the evidence for it? Any questions about this? You guys don't find this controversial? What are you confused by anything? Do you want to challenge me before I present the evidence? OK, all right. So let me start presenting the evidence, OK? So the first piece of evidence is, again, Egyptian mythology. So in Egyptian mythology, and it's very different from other mythologies we'll study in the future, like that of Mesopotamia, the gods give everything to the people. The people don't really do anything. Ra gives life, Asaris gives civilization, Horace provides the kingship. So the Egyptian understanding of the relationship with the gods is basically, if they worship the gods well enough, the gods will reward them. So the idea that the gods will make the people build tombs, build tombs doesn't really make any sense. It makes more sense. The pharaoh is helping the Egyptians achieve eternal peace by inspiring them to build the pyramid. The second thing is the architectural quality of the pyramid. Now, there is a misconception, a myth, the pyramids were built by slaves. They just had slaves, they used slaves, but they never used slaves for religious purposes, right? Because slaves, you can't really trust slaves. So it was tens of thousands of laborers who built the pyramid together. And it's a complete mystery to people how they're able to achieve such a miraculous building. And so the answer is this. Let's think about for the past thousand years. The most impressive buildings in the world are usually churches, temples, mosques, right? So that just demonstrates the power of religious devotion in the act of creation. So if the Egyptians saw the pyramids as the ultimate temple as bringing God on earth, You can imagine everyone of them would work very hard in order to do their best. Does that make sense? The third is the idea of the cult of the skull. Around this time and throughout the world, people practice ancestors of worship. So the way they did that usually is maybe they have an ancestor who was what we guarded. They would keep a skull around. They were decorated with clay in ochre. And they would use this skull as maybe a portal into the outer world, into the spirit world, in order to draw inspiration, to draw good luck from this. Okay? So the idea that they would use the pharaoh's body as a portal into the heavens is a very, would be a very common idea at that time. All right? And then you have cave paintings. So remember way back way early in the semester, we looked at Ice Age cave paintings. Inside, so these paintings inside caves and we discussed these paintings were a means of religious worship, of bringing the spirit world into our world, connecting the two, in order to separate life and hunting. Then you have a place like Gopalade Teple, which is considered one of the earliest temples. Okay, remember it is a religious monument on top of a hill, okay, which would be also another way for you to connect our world with the heavens and for your worship to all divine energy from the heavens. So this, in other words, there's a pattern of humans trying to connect the spirit world with our world through religious worship. And the pyramid represents the ultimate temple. Does that make sense? So the pyramid is a continuation of this religious devotion and worship and religious practice. All right. OK. Any questions before I move on? OK. So now the last question is why did they stop being a pyramid? And there's a very good reason why they stopped being a pyramid. Because remember, this pyramid was about creating eternal peace, pleasing the gods, unifying the world. That's a theory. The problem is this theory doesn't work. because in about 2200 BCE, some of the 4.2, 4.2-kilow year event happened. Think of this as a mini ice age. Where for about 100 years, there's a drought in Egypt. Well, that's a problem, right? Because the entire point of the pyramid, why people sacrificed themselves so hard to work on the pyramid, was to prevent a drought in Egypt. It was to control the Nile, and they failed. So this creates, first of all, a crisis of faith. A crisis of faith. Many now are forced to reject their faith in the Pharaoh. And now you see the rise of the priesthood and other gods as well. So the first major reason why they stopped doing the pyramids is the crisis of faith. Second problem is, in order to build the pyramids, you need a pyramid economy, a pyramid economy. And what the pyramid economy represents is centralized planning, right? Centralization. The Pharaoh and his palace are able to coordinate all the resources of the state in order to create the pyramids. We know that when you have a centralization, you have three problems. The first is inequality. So if you're part of this planned economy, you do very well for yourself, okay? But if you're not, then you become poor, okay? So inequality is a huge issue. But you also have a problem of corruption, where people in the system, they wanna steal because it's just easier to do, okay? And the third problem is just waste. It's not very efficient. So basically a pyramid, the pyramid economy is this complete waste of resources. The third problem is this, okay? And this is actually a much more, this is a huge problem, okay? It's the idea of a nihilistic religious belief. What this religious saying is, life doesn't matter. It's death that matters. It's death that allows us to be like God, to be eternal, right? And in order to ensure our ascent into Godhood, one, we have to be close to the Pharaoh, okay? We have to be loyal to the Pharaoh, but two, we have to ensure we obtain a lot of wealth in our life, okay? So basically what Egypt was doing during the Peruvian economy was taking all its grain, all its resources, and then selling it overseas in order to bring back precious metals that they could put in their graves so that they could take these precious metals, gold, jewelry, into the afterlife with them. So basically, they were just taking all this tremendous wealth of Egypt, almost unlimited wealth of Egypt, and just squandering it, gambling it away basically, and the promise of an eternal afterlife. And they really didn't care about the here and now. They didn't care about building a great nation. They really weren't concerned about ensuring everyone was well off and prosperous and happy in a nation. Okay, so you had an elite who was concerned about abuse and the power in order to steal as much money as possible in order to ensure a good afterlife. And this is the three major reasons why they stopped building impairments. One, because it's a quest of faith, doesn't really work. Second is the centralization creates inequality, corruption, and ways. And third is the religious belief can only lead to the corruption of the state and tyranny. So I answered those three questions. Any questions before I continue? Okay, right. So yeah, that's a great point. So you have to write that even though they stop building pyramids, This civilization would go on for the 2,000 years. It was still for the majority of that, a very prosperous, stable nation. That was basically the hegemon of the Western world. So this is the Old Kingdom. That's what they, the Old Kingdom focused on building the pyramids, but the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom would also have a lot of glory as well. So I don't mean to denigrate, the society, okay? I'm just pointing out some logical flaws in the society that will lead to their eventual decay. Because even though the old kingdom will collapse, the society is very resilient. So as I said, the old kingdom will be replaced by the middle kingdom after a large civil war. Also, they will make changes to society that would make society much more stable. And the major change is to take all the centralized powers of the Pharaoh and then devolve it into the priesthood and creating a priest democracy, okay? Which is very much like the Confucian democracy in China. And they will also start importing new ideas from overseas. So I apologize if I'm implying that this is the end of Egypt, it's not. after they oaking them, after stopping the pyramids, you will have a new flourishing of creativity and innovation in Egypt. That, but they stopped perceiving the pyramids as the end on beyond. Whereas, and what the point I'm trying to make is, during the oaking them, they did perceive the pyramid as the Manhattan Project, okay? They really thought if we build this thing, then there'll be eternal peace. And you can also make the argument the Israelites in the Bible make fun of them because there's the Tower of Babel story, right? The Tower of Babel story where the humans are erically trying to build a tower up to heaven to be with God, right? And you can argue that's what the pyramid is. And God laughs at them and mocks them and they never succeed. and then God punishes them by making them speak different languages, okay? Right? Sure. So this is a great question, okay? What did Egypt's member about the Great Pyramid? So Herodotus was running about 400 BC, okay? And this was about 2,000 years after the Great Pyramid. And Herodotus travels around Egypt and he's basically a historian, he's a journalist. He wants to know how they built the Great Pyramid. And what he discovers is, they just don't know. Not only do they not know, but they don't even know how to rebuild one. If you were asked to do this in 400 BC, you build a pyramid, they've lost an expertise. And so let me elaborate on this. When I talk about the pyramid economy, I'm talking about three things. I'm talking about specialization, right? Just massive specialization, including how to carve how to move granite, how to do measurements, okay? You have specialization going on. Then you have something called institutionalization, which basically creates a memory of this knowledge. And you do that through bypassing this knowledge to your sons and your grandsons and to maybe in a guild or workshop, okay? And then you also have systemization, which is to say you have to bring all these pieces together, okay? So the pyramid economy was extremely complex because you did all three things to happen at the same time, specialization, individualization, and systemization. You could also argue the man who created the system, the pyramid economy, his name was Imhotat. And he's revered in Egypt as a divine figure. He was basically grand vizier to the Pharaoh. He was royalty, but he was a man, but he was able to contribute so much to Egypt that they defied him basically. Okay? And you can argue like his major contribution was in creating this pyramid economy that are all three elements, specialization, industrialization, and systemization. Okay? Because it's actually very hard to put the pieces together. You need a writing system, you need a financial system, you need a lot of elements, okay? I'm making this sound a lot easier than it really is. So that's the first thing. Very complex. Second thing is, remember for the Egyptians and for the Pharaoh, the pyramids represented God and Earth. So there has to be mystery and secrecy around the building of the pyramid. So as I said, what makes the most sense is for them to build these models around the pyramid So these working teams would know where to go at what time. But after they build the pyramids, it would make sense from destroy all records in order to maintain a sense of divinity and inspiration. They're trying to create awe and fear and inspiration. So they would not want for people to know how to build the pyramids. They would think this has to be a gift from God, from the ferrule. Does that make sense? But that's a great question. Thanks. Any more questions before I move on? That's a great question. Where was the mummy of the ferrule? So in this theory, you have to understand what matters is that the pyramid. What matters is the body, the ferrule. Because the ferrule is a body that's sacred and divine. So if it's sacred and divine, then you We need a priesthood, a cult of the pharaoh, to secure and take care of the body. Okay? Does that make sense? So in other words, there has to be a team taking care of the pharaoh's body, the mummy. And that ensure, first and foremost, it's safety. Okay? So the Great Pyramid was part of a complex called the Giza Complex. So there are actually two other pyramids. And then around the pyramids are these tombs of people who worked for the feral but who were not divided, okay? And you can make the argument, what they're trying to do is create a constellation, right? Because when you look at the sky, stars don't travel by themselves, they travel in constellations. So it makes sense for the son and the grandson to be buried alongside curfew, but as lesser dieties, as lesser pyramids, to show the people the harmony, balance, order of the system. And what's great about the system is it ensures loyalty of your working for the Pharaoh because your loyal, your granted a tomb around the Pharaoh which guarantees your ascension into the eternal afterlife. So you can be eternally with the Pharaoh. So this is a system of morality basically. So this is fine because there's lots of protections for the Pharaoh, right? He's surrounded by many different systems. But when the system was breaking down, it was clear that Egypt was breaking the Civil War, then the cult of the Pharaoh had a responsibility to take the body and place it somewhere that no one could find it. Right? Because again, what matters in this system is is that the pyramid, what matters is the body. The body is what gives the pyramid's energy and power. So they have to protect that body at all costs. So the reason why we can't find the body is, they made sure we could not find the body, right? Because the body is the mechanism, the portal by which the pharaoh will resurrect himself. If we have that, then we control the pharaoh. We control God, okay? Does that make sense? So they must have a secret caves or places where they put these bodies. And the purpose is to ensure they can never be found. So great question. Thank you. Any more questions before I finish the class? OK. So what's inside the pyramid? So first of all, the parents have been around for about 45 hundred years. And tomb raiding was a huge problem. So it was actually in the pyramids, we can't be sure about, right? Because of time, because of tomb raiding, okay? We didn't find that much inside the pyramid, okay? There were no pictures, artwork, there were very few hieroglyphics inside the Great Pyramid. There were hieroglyphics and paintings and other pyramids, okay? But inside the Great Pyramid, we haven't found that much, which I think gives even more credit to my theory that this was meant to be a temple of worship. And this is also why people believe it's a tomb, because there's so few artwork. If it were a temple instead, you would imagine there would be a lot of artwork. Any more questions before I finish the class? Are you guys clear so far? All right, so I wanna finish the class with a different question, Which is, why is it that my interpretation is so radically different from the mainstream academic interpretation? And I want to propose the way that our minds work today are radically different from the way that the minds of people like the Egyptians worked, for three reasons. Today, the Egyptian people had a pre-literate mind. They also had a pre-science mind, also pre-capitalistic. So let me explain. Pre-literate is very simple. It just means they didn't read and write. They just spoke. And we are taught the literate mind is more powerful than the oral mind. But that's not true, okay? We think about it, the oral mind works through imagination. their own mind is capable of tremendous memory. Because back then, in order to do anything, you had to memorize a lot of information. Now we can just go online, right? So their minds, even though we're pre-literate, they were much more imaginative than we are today. And their memories were stronger. That's why they were able to build a great pyramid, because everyone was able to memorize the model and figure out his or her place inside the structure. They were also able to imagine in their heads the great pyramid. Remember Homer and Virgil. The way that children learn Homer and Virgil is by memorizing them, okay? And you can do that. There are people today who memorize the Koran and who memorize the Torah. Okay, it takes some time, but you're able to do that. So back then they were able to build the pyramid because they were able to visualize the pyramid in their minds. And you can do that with a preliterate mind. Second is the idea of pre-science. So in today's world, science is our God. In school you're taught the scientific method, which is basically you collect information, then you synthesize it, then you write your thesis. It's a step-by-step logical process. But if you're a prescientist mind, then where do you get your ideas from? You get your ideas through divine inspiration, through God, right? So you can make the argument that back then, they were capable of these grand ideas that we're not capable of today because we're locked in by the discipline of science. The other problem of science is it's very materialistic, meaning we're focused on the here and now. We focus on what we can see as opposed to what we feel or what we believe. Right? So when we look at the pyramid, we're always about what was built instead of what were they feeling when they were building this. And that's a huge difference. And the third difference is pre-capitalistic. Today we do things to make money. We come to school because we want to get a job because we want to make money and we'll buy things. It's a very utilitarian mindset. But for most of human history, most civilizations were not capitalistic. They were religious. They were focused on community. They were focused on what they could contribute to the betterment of the people around them. They were concerned about their relationship with God. They were concerned about how to create peace in the world. They're asking big questions like what is good in, what is evil? What is justice? What is fairness? What is justice? And so they were much more focused on building a pyramid as a way to build community and peace, an eternity on earth. Okay? So in other words, what's interesting is, even though we are much more technologically advanced, we're much wealthier than the Egyptians, we don't have the imagination, We don't have the will to build something like the Great Pyramid again. And that's why I think even today the Great Pyramid captures the imagination of so many people around the world because it's really beyond our own imagination. It really shows the limitations of our own imagination. OK, that's it. Any questions? OK. Yeah, let's all be intuitive and pre-science here. Yeah. OK. So this begins at a broad age. This is part of the Bronze Age. Egypt is the greatest civilization of the Bronze Age. Next class, we will look at Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civilization. So there are three great Bronze Age civilizations. Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley."}

I'm going to review very quickly what we did last class. So last class we learn about money a theism which is the idea of One true God and as I said last class this marked a intellectual revolution in human history and for money theism We develop three new ideas ideas, which are money, individual, and the nation state. It's important to note that these ideas have always existed in human history, but with monotheism, these ideas became the dominant paradigms. And together, they will give us modernity and create the world that we live in today. So that's what we discussed last class. And remember last class, we also discussed that this created a lot of problems for us. There are a lot of benefits, but there are also a lot of consequences. Okay, so we're gonna continue the story of humanity today. And today I wanna focus on a very specific question. Why do societies rise and why do they fall? Okay, and I know that these first few classes may seem abstract and theoretical, but that's because we're developing the ethical models in order to better understand our world. So as we move on, we'll start looking at very concrete examples. But for the first few classes, please be patient. We are going to develop the theory to understand the world, all right? So let's discuss societies, why they rise and why they decline. Now, unfortunately, we live in a world in decline. So there are lots of signs that the world isn't declined. What are these signs? Shout out some signs. Yeah, very good. So you have conflict and wars. You look at the situation in Ukraine. Look at the situation in the Middle East. But also, you may have seen the news and you have seen conflicts arising in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Myanmar. Also, Trump is about to send US troops to Mexico and Venezuela. So we live in a world of conflict. And that tells us that the world is in decline. What are some other signs? Good, yes. So you have climate change, okay? We are putting too much pressure on the environment. So the air, the water, the land is becoming much more toxic, okay? Good, what else? Good, yes, unemployment is going up. Well, not only that, but people's attitude towards work is declining. We live in an age when people don't take work that seriously. People are not as enthusiastic, they're not as motivated to work hard as before. We call this in China the Bai Lan age, right? The age of Bai Lan, meaning let it rot. Like who cares? Don't take things too seriously. In America, the term is called quite quitting. You pretend to work, but you're not really working. What are some other signs? So also you have lower birth rate. And this is a very important sign, right? Because if you think about it, if young people refuse to get married and have babies, eventually the world is gonna die off, right? So this is actually a very important sign that the world is in decline. And we're seeing this happen throughout the entire world in all societies. The only exception is Israel and Georgia, but these are very small rare cases. For most societies, there's rapid decline in birth rate. What are some other signs? You see a lower standard of living. And all this means is that inflation, right? So people people make less money and they can afford less. Prices go up, the people's wages go down. So that's another sign of decline. What are some other signs? Okay, you also see higher stress, right? Higher stress, people feel more anxious, people feel more depressed, people feel more stressed. Emotionally, they feel drained. Okay, what else? People are less optimistic, right? Okay? Greater pessimism. Okay? Also, this is really important is the idea of debt, right? Both public and private. There are lots of governments around the world that are facing a fiscal crisis. A fiscal crisis just means that they spend more than they take in in tax revenue. There are many families in China, in the United States, throughout the world that are heavily in debt. Okay, so debt is a huge issue for the world today. Also, lower cohesion and trust. And what this means is that people no longer trust each other as they did before. Society is less cohesive. If you walk on the street and you see a man on the street bleeding or hurt, you're less likely to help him. And this is very true not only in China, but also elsewhere as well. So lower trust issues. What are some other signs? Greater disease, yeah. Increasing disease. People are less healthy than before. people are more stressed than before. People are less optimistic. So we can go on and on and on because the signs of rapid social decline are too many. Now, these are signs of decline. Well, if we look at rise, then obviously it's the opposite, right? People are much more willing to trust each other. Rather than go into debt, people will save money. People are healthier. People are much more optimistic. People are having lots and lots of babies, right? People are employed, okay? So these are all signs that society is inclined. The rise, it's the opposite. Also, another sign of decline that's very important that doesn't really happen in China, happens in the Western world is immigration. OK? Immigration. Immigration is a huge issue in the Western world, and we will discuss immigration in future classes. But immigration is a sign of decline, because it reduces cohesion. And it also reduces the standard of living. Another sign of decline is also housing prices go up. So people can no longer afford to buy a house. This is true in China. Young people can no longer afford to buy a house. But it's also true throughout the world. It's really hard for young people to get by. Also fiscal crisis. We talked about this. But the idea of fiscal crisis is the government cannot afford a lot of public expenditures. In the future, maybe five, ten years from now, pension will be a huge problem for governments. Okay? So these are all signs of rapid decline. All right. Now, having done this, what I'm going to do now is go over some theories as to why this is happening. Why is the world in decline? Okay? And there are lots and lots of theories, but I will present three theories to you that I think are interesting. The first is the idea of financialization. And this theory is proposed by an economist, by a French economist named Thomas Piketty. Piketty, okay? And he wrote a book called Capital in the 21st Century. It is a fantastic book. You don't have to read the book, but if you have a chance, you should definitely pick it up because it is a very easy, but very illuminating read. And what he argues is that what happens in society is that capitalism transitions from face to face to face. In the beginning, you have consumer capitalism, meaning that what the Saudi is trying to do is create goods that consumers want to buy. This is an era of rapid wealth generation. Then you move into financial capitalism, which is a period of investment. Rather than build factories, you put the money into the stock market, okay? So you're trying to generate as much money as possible. But what we discussed last class that's very important is wealth and money are not the same thing. So in the first phase, in super capitalism, you focus on the generation of wealth. In financial capitalism, you focus on the generation of money. And then you move on to monopoly capitalism, which is where just a few companies control everything. And we live in an era of monopoly capitalism. And this happens because it is much more profitable for companies to be monopolies than to be in competition with each other. Financial capitalism is looking to create as much money as possible, not as much wealth. And so a few companies come to dominate, become monopolies. And that's the age we live in today. Now why is this important? It's important because when we make this transition, people are no longer focused on working hard, They only focus on speculating. So let me give you an example. Let's just say I'm an entrepreneur and I want to make as much money as possible. Well, what I do is I build a factory. When I build a factory, I'm creating real wealth. Because a factory requires you to hire workers. It requires you to build technology. It requires you to build goods that people want to buy. But after I build a factory and I make a lot of money, I want to take this money and let it grow as fast as possible so I can put it in a stock market. Okay? And that's just how people behave. The problem is that if too many people do that, then no one's really working. No one's really, no one's creating real wealth in the economy. The other problem is that because of the way capitalism is set up. If everyone's paying the money in a stock market, the stock market grows too fast. And the real economy does not grow that fast. And the difference is stark. Thomas Piketty spent a lot of time going over income tax, just looking at how much tax people paid. He did a lot of statistical analysis. And what he discovered is the real economy in late-stage capitalism will grow about 2%. the financial economy will go at 5%. And this is really key. What this is telling us is that if you have a million dollars, you could choose to go and open a restaurant or you could choose to invest in the stock market. If you open a restaurant, you will make at most $20,000 a year. But if you were to put in the stock market, you would make $50,000 a year. So everyone's going to put all the money in the stock market, which allows for the stock market to increase. But the real economy is not improving. And therefore, you have all these issues arise. Greater unemployment, greater debt. No one's really working, okay? So that's the idea of financialization. And what Piketty argues is that this is just a natural cycle. This is just a natural byproduct of capitalism. We live in a state, we live in an age of late stage capitalism. Is this clear to you guys? Any questions before I move on to the second theory? Let's move on to the second theory called elite over production. And this was proposed by a historian named Peter Turchin. And Peter Turchin spent decades looking at why societies rise and fall. He looked at the Roman Empire. He looked at the French Revolution. He looked at many different examples. And what he believed is societies fall, decline, collapse, because of the idea of elite overproduction. Meaning you have too many powerful people competing for limited positions of power. All right? So to understand this, I'm gonna talk about another experiment called rat utopia. And rat utopia was a series of experiments conducted by an American scientist named James B. Calhoun. And what James Calhoun was trying to do in his experiments was trying to figure out what living in a world of abundance and wealth and security meant. After World War II, the world was divided between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was the Cold War. But it was also a time of increasing abundance due to technology and peace. And the population was increasing. So James Calhoun conducted these experiments to figure out what this meant for the world. So what he did was this. He had a room. that was sealed off from the world. And in the room, he put in food and water and housing for a colony of rats, maybe like 10 rats at first, but they quickly became 400, 500 rats. And at first the rats were really happy, but no matter how Kahun configured the experiment, experiment, ultimately the rats always ended up killing each other. Okay? So what he discovered is if you live in a world of abundance and security, the end result is the rats always kill each other. And he kept on doing this for 20 years and he could never ever create a situation in which the rats lived peacefully and you can never figure out why this was the case. And even today, there's a huge debate as to why this is the case. But there's a theory, okay? And the theory is this. The rats were not competing for food. They were really competing for status. All right. So let's think of this, okay? In a state of nature, in the real world, rats compete each other for mating rights, right? So you see a beautiful rat and you fight over her, right? The rat who wins out is now the alpha male. And the alpha male can have as many female companions as he wants. And what do the other rats do? In nature, what will the other rats do? So the other rats will probably run away, go somewhere else and find other female companions, right? Because everyone's trying to be the alpha male. But in what's the problem with James Calhoun's experiment? Why do they fight each other? There's no place for them to go. They're stuck where they are. You understand? So status is what we call a zero sum game. I win, you lose. Okay? There can only be one winner. But in nature, if I win, then the other rats run away and try to figure out, try to build their own colony. But in James Kahoon's experiment, there's no place for them to go. And so all that happens is they keep on fighting each other until they die. Okay? And that's the idea of elite or of a production. And that's what Peter Turchin says. The elite, the children of elite are always fighting for positions of power. Not normal people, it's the children of elite. But eventually elite have too many children and there are not enough positions of power. Okay, another way of saying this is that in China today there are too many graduates of Peking University, Beidai and Tsinghua University, Tsinghua, right? They want to be the big boss. They want to have the power, but there's too many of them. Okay? And there's no place for them to go. And that leads to conflict in society. And ultimately, what Peter Turchin has discovered is, if that's the case, then the lead over production will ultimately lead to either war or revolution. It will lead to the collapse of society. And there's no way around this. Okay? That's Peter Turchin. Now I want to go to the third theory. And the third theory is the idea of a civilizational life cycle. And this is proposed by a German philosopher, scholar named Oswald Spangler. And what he argues is that society, culture, civilization, it's no different from a person. As a person, as a human being, we go through a life cycle. We are born. We grow up. we mature, then we die, right? And there's no way around this. We all have limited life cycles. You can live to 100, you can live to 150, but eventually you'll die. And what also Spengler says is that happens in society as well. And there's nothing anyone can do of this. So let's go over the life cycle for civilization, okay? In the beginning, you are in the village. Then you move to the town. Then you move to the city. Then you develop the mega city. Not all civilizations will go through the cycle, but the successful ones will go through the cycle. You start off, so the Romans, the Qing dynasty. You start off in a village. Then if you're successful in the village, you build a town, then when you're in a town and you're successful, you defeat other towns and you build a city, they become a mega city. And what Oswald Spengler says is, at the height of the civilization, the civilization must now die. So let's go over the theory. Well, in a village, life is pretty simple. People work hard, they are united, united, they have a collective mentality. Everyone's helping each other. And also what's really important is lots of babies, right? It's very common for mothers to give birth to 10, 11 kids in a village, right? And the reason why is kids are free labor. So you're incentivized to have as many children as possible. Okay, so this is the framework of a village. But as you go up the civilization ladder, as you mature as a civilization, what happens is you have increased abstraction. Abstraction is just a fancy word for you're removed from reality. Okay, so when you're in a village, you understand everything, right? You understand, oh, the food that I eat comes from the seeds I implant, right? But when you're in a city, guess what? That those drinks you're drinking, you have no idea where it comes from, right? The food you're eating, you have no idea where it comes from. It's all abstract to you. It's all removed from reality, okay? So in the village, people are engaged in working hard and in helping each other. But as you move up, people become much more individualistic. You're concerned about your own personal pleasure. You're concerned about what, how do I derive benefit from this? Okay, so another way of saying this is, in a village, what keeps people together are emotions and tradition and relationships. But when you move to a mega city, what is it that holds people together? It's money. Right? Money is the greatest abstraction. The problem with money is that it means we don't have to ever trust each other. In a village, if you get sick, everyone comes and helps you, right? But in the city, if you get sick, you go to the hospital and pay the doctor. Your neighbors don't have to care. Your family doesn't have to help you. Okay, so you become individualized. You become atomized. Okay. And in this mega city, what happens is because you are concerned only about your own individual pleasure, you don't work hard anymore. In fact, what you want to do is you want immigrants to work for you, right? You don't, you don't care about other people or you care about yourself. And guess what guys? You don't want to have any children. Okay? And that's why the mega city represents the death of civilization. And what is Beijing? What is Shanghai? What is Washington, DC? What is New York? What is Paris? What is London? They're all mega cities. Okay? And that's why we have these trends. And what Oswald Spengler says is there's there's nothing anyone can do about this. It is a natural life cycle. So these are the three major theories. I want you guys to remember. Sorry, can you give the microphone? Yeah, can you speak to the microphone? But what if there is a universal target that force everyone needs to work together? Will that work out to like, everyone just put down all of these problems and figure out that. Yeah, okay, I understand. That is a great question, okay? So the question to rephrase it, okay, is yeah, but what if there's an external threat, okay? An external threat. If there's an external threat, then surely this system, this life cycle, can be extended, right? And external threats are examples of, Hey, let's say there's an alien invasion. Let's just say China's being attacked by the United States. Right? And unfortunately, the answer is, it does not matter. Because once you've reached the point of a mega city, first of all, you're so selfish, you're so self-absorbed, you are not aware of external threats. The other issue is, you're no longer capable of working together. because you don't trust each other. So the external threats factor doesn't really matter. But that's a great question. Thank you for asking. Yes, in theory, oh my god, if aliens come, then humans would unite. No, that's not what would happen. What would happen is certain factions of humans would try to align the aliens to conquer everyone else. So having gone through these three theories, what I'm going to do is combine them together to create a comprehensive holistic broad theory of why societies rise and fall, okay? All right. And the problem with theories is they are simplistic and inaccurate and imprecise. So I warn you that this theory has limitations. But for our purposes, what we wanna do is have a working framework. And then when we apply this framework to concrete examples, we can better refine this framework. So I warn you that this framework, there are a lot of problems with it, but it is a useful tool for us to analyze society in the past. All right, so I'm going to generalize issues about how society is structured. So at the core of society, the very powerful people, These are certain families, okay? These are the founding families of this nation. And there's not that many of them, maybe 10, maybe 100, okay? But at most 100. So if you go back to the Roman Empire, and Roman Empire controlled most of Europe, as well as Anatolia, Egypt, it was a huge area, but really there were only about 200 families that controlled the Roman Empire, okay? All right, so how these families express power, how they control power in society is through three mechanisms, okay? Three pillars of power. And these three pillars are finance, okay? Finance, we talked about last class, it's just central banking, all right? Second pillar is religion. Religion is just what people believe, how to control what people believe. Now, the religion of today is science and technology. And the third pillar is intelligence or spies. Now, for the purpose of to save time, I'm not going to go too deeply into intelligence and religion. But I will in future classes. I just need you to remember that there are three pillars of power at the core of society, finance, intelligence, and religion. And it's their nexus, their combination that allows the elite to control everyone else. Okay. So from this nexus, they will control all aspects of society, including schools, including the military, including government, including the media, including culture including crime the mafia okay every aspect of society that you can imagine it's being controlled in some respect by this nexus of power okay also you have like corporations right and then at the outer edge are the people okay the people because they're so massive the massive people they're They're the ones who generate wealth for society. So this system is designed to create as much energy as possible for the people, okay? Energy, because the harder the people work, the more wealth is generated in society, all right? So a metaphor that we can use is this. Think of society as a corporation. The people are the workers, right? They're the ones who do the real work. The elite, these families are the owners. And these people in between the middle class are the managers, okay? So again, this is a very simple metaphor, and it's not accurate, but it's useful for analysis. Okay, so the families are the owners of the corporation, the people, the workers, the people in between the managers or the managers. And we call these people the middle class. There've been other names for it in China before in history. We call them the scholar officials, right? Another name for them is something called the professional managerial class, PMC. Also, another name for them is the petty bourgeoisie. Okay? Again, you don't need to know these names. For the purpose of simplicity, we will just call them the middle class. All right, does that make sense? Okay, so having gone through the shortage of society, let's talk about what happens when society rises and falls. When it rises, the dynamic of these three groups, it's very interesting. When it rises, the families who own the nation are happy to let the managers control society. And this is what we call democracy, right? And the managers are always providing feedback to the families and saying, we should treat workers better, we treat workers better than they will work harder. Okay? And at this point, things are great. The people feel that they have a voice in the system, they're making good money, everyone's really happy. But what happens because of the elite of production is, These families produce too many children who want positions of power. Basically, they want to spend money from the corporation. And now the corporation is in trouble. It's in debt. Okay. So at this point, what happens is this, you would think the managers would say to the families, listen guys, we need to be more fair to the people. But what really happens in reality is the managers exploit the people. The managers will now deceive. They will lie to the people. They will commit fraud. They will exploit the people. Why? The reason why is this. What the managers really do is something called rent-seeking behavior. Classical behavior just means they have a certain power that they want to explore in order to extract wealth from other people. So for example, the more classic example is you own an apartment in Beijing, right? So you rent it out to someone who needs to live in Beijing and you collect rent. Well, this is true for a lot of people. So if you are a lawyer, you collect rent because only you can work in the court system. So if you want to sue someone or you have a contract dispute, you have to go to a lawyer. The lawyer is collecting rent. And that's what the middle class, the professional manager of class do. They are rent seekers. Another way of saying this is, guys, if you go to a company, you know what the workers do. You know what the managers do? They really don't do that much. And this is true for the middle class. Like, the managers, the middle class, live very nice lives. And so, when the company's in trouble, the managers are like, well, I have a very nice life, I have a very nice job, but I don't really don't do anything. So I'll probably the first get fired, so they have to show their worth, they have to prove their worth, and therefore they exploit the workers. Okay, do you understand? They push the workers harder to generate more wealth. All right, so, in the decline phase, This is not really a problem. But what happens over time is the conflict within the elite gets worse and worse, elite over production. And what will eventually happen is they will form into factions that compete against each other for power. Okay? And when that happens, then society becomes aligned into factions. The factions will bring in certain elements of the middle class, which will then bring in certain elements of the people. And now what happened is civil war or revolution. And this marks the collapse of society. What's really important, first remember, is this is a natural cycle. And no amount of external threat will change that dynamic. Why? Because it's very common for these factions to align with mercenaries. So there's foreign invasions, not because some guy overseas is like, oh, this society is unstable, I'll come and invade. What happens often is a certain faction invites mercenaries into the nation as part of the power struggle. And then the mercenaries realize, you know what? We can stick this for ourselves. So when you reach a collapse phase, the society is much too insular, much too racked with infighting to care about external threats. And that's why if there's an alienation, it really wouldn't change anything. All right? Is this clear to you guys? So again, this is the model working with to explain the rise and fall of societies. At first, in this system, the elite families are willing to let the manager of class incentivize and motivate the workers to do the best. And you do that through democracy, through openness, through meritocracy, through innovation. But over time, as these elite families have more and more children, and these children are engaged in ransacking behavior, they basically want to steal profits from a corporation. The corporation runs into trouble, and the managers are forced to coerce the people, which leads to greater conflict. And eventually over time, the collapse happens when society breaks up into different factions, which leads to civil war or revolution or war. So that's a model working with. All right, any questions? Are you guys clear about this? Yeah. On what if they just like don't have that much shooting? Excuse me, what's the question? Like, what if the families, that the families don't have that much shooting? Well, this model still works. Oh, that's a great question. Okay. So what if families don't have that many children? Okay, that's a really interesting question. And the answer is these families first and foremost won't have as many children as possible, right? Because how do you pass on your power? So maybe the middle class don't want to have that many, don't want to have that many children, but the elite will have a lot of children because they need to be able to pass on their power and privilege to their children. In fact, the elite is first and foremost concerned with passing on the privilege to the next generation. Okay, and that's why these families expand so fast. And also, who wants to marry into elite families? Who wants to marry into them? Everyone, all right? And they have to marry into other families in order to maintain their power. Okay? So having children in a marriage is a way for the elite to maintain their power. Okay? But that's a good question. And any more questions before I continue. Okay, so let us summarize what we've learned so far and discuss what is it that allows societies to rise and fall. So we'll look at three phases, the rise, the decline, and the collapse. Okay, so what I mean decline, I don't mean like things are getting worse. I mean things aren't improving, okay? So rise is when things get better, decline is when things are stagnant or getting slightly worse, collapse is when society is about to fall apart, okay? So if you look at these three particular phases of society, there are different characteristics. In the, when society rises, it is first and foremost open. Open just means that you have opportunities for social mobility in a society. If you're a poor person, you can make money. You can become wealthy. Your talent is appreciated. It's a meritocracy. It's innovative. If you criticize society, people are like, thank you for criticizing us because criticism makes us better people. There's open debate. Now what's really interesting is most young societies are open societies. So for example, in 1950s, America was a democracy, right? China was communist. But this is really interesting. In the 1950s, they were both open societies. You could criticize leaders. In fact, you encouraged to criticize leaders. China was as democratic back then as the United States. Okay? So it's not about political systems, it's just about what state you are in social development. So if you're young, you're gonna be open. You're going to be democratic. You're going to be meritocratic. You want to learn so you will listen to criticism. That's the first great characteristic of a society on the rise. It's openness. But when you reach a decline phase, guess what? Society becomes bureaucratic. Bureaucratic. Why? Because if we go back to this model, as the company loses more and more money, The managerial class is concerned with maintaining their jobs. So they become bureaucrats. They have to prove their worth. So they create a lot of paperwork. They make everyone follow the rules. Society becomes more and more bureaucratic. Then in the cloud space, society becomes authoritarian. Before, the client is all following the rules. Now it's just rule by force. But there's no way of saying this. In the rise phase, what matters is the consent. Okay? So these three groups, the elite, the middle class, and the people, they're all working together to improve society. There's consent. But when you hit the decline phase, now it's their deception. And then when you hit the collapse phase, it's coercion. So let me give you an example. Let's just say we are in the rise phase, right? Well, we wanna go to lunch. So we discuss where we go to lunch. I went to McDonald's, but you guys wanna go to Pizza Hut or KFC, we have the bait, and then eventually we vote and whoever wants to go, the majority wins, okay? That's a consent phase. When we hit the decline phase deception, I'm the teacher, so I say to you, hey guys, let's go to McDonald's because Wong Faye will be there. or Jack Ma will be there, or it's free hamburgers today. I'm lying to you to get what I want. And then in a cloud space is I say to you, I'm the teacher and I will beat you up if you don't listen to me. So in a rise phase, what matters first and foremost is unity of the people. We're all working together. There's empathy. There's concern for other people. I want to be your friend. We need to work together to make society better. But in the decline phase, it's really about stability. It's about making sure that society maintains a status quo. When we reach a collapse phase, it is survival. Screw you. I want to live. And if I have to kill you, I'll kill you. So this is a map that shows us what happens when society rises, declines, and collapses. Now what's really interesting about this is the timing, okay? So if you actually look at societies, the timeline, it goes like this, okay? There's a steep rise, the decline is slow, and the collapse is sudden. So people think, oh, decline, you know, things get worse, worse, but you know, we follow this trend, we'll still be here, but actually the collapse happens really fast. Why? The reason why is this system cannot survive external shocks. External shocks is a perfect storm of crises. So another way of saying this is, maybe society prepares for, okay, if there's a plague, we'll do this. If there's a climate crisis, we'll do this. If there's a drought, we'll do this. If there's a war, we'll do this, okay? What society is that prepared for is, these things happening all at once. the plague, the drought, war, it's a revolution. They all happen at once. It's a perfect storm. And that's what leads to the clouds, because society's not prepared for this. And why is society not prepared for this? Because when you get the authoritarian phase, you're not allowed to criticize the system anymore. The problem are those who speak out. The problem is those who point out the plums of society. In the rise phase, those who criticize society are the heroes. They are appreciated. They are rewarded. In the collapse phase, those who speak out are the enemies of society. And therefore, society cannot be prepared for any external threats, which leads to its collapse. Any questions? OK. So this is the ethical model that we're working with. And again, we're going to apply it to the present, and then we're going to apply it to the past. So with this integral model, what we can do is make sure predictions about the future. So I will make these predictions. And I expect these things to happen in the next five to 10 years, after 10 years, or 10 to 20 years. OK, I'm not, I don't know the time frame, OK? I expect these things to happen. OK, the first thing that's going to happen in the Western world is decline of democracy and freedom. So remember, in the rise phase, society is democratic and open and meritocratic. But as you move on, it becomes more bureaucratic and ultimately authoritarian. Okay. So we'll see the United States, Europe become much more authoritarian. You will see a collapse of democracy and freedom in these nations. And then, and already we're seeing this happen in the United States, where Trump is using more and more military to resolve issues. Right. So that's a first prediction. And this is going to happen throughout the Western world. Second thing is economic collapse. So as people have less and less right to speak up, they feel less invested in the system, they're less willing to work. Therefore, you have economic collapse. People don't believe in the system anymore. The system is in crisis. This will lead to immigration. The government is like, you know what, if the people don't want to work, screw them, let's bring in immigrants to do their work. This is, let's replace our population. But the people are not going to sit back and take it, right? This leads to civil war. People are not going to eat each other on the streets. And the government is like, you know what, if we continue to let them fight, eventually they're going to come after us. So what we'll do is send them off to like the stupid, pointless wars overseas. So now you have stupid wars, stupid foreign wars. And these are my five predictions for the world for the next five, 10, 20 years. Europe and America will see less freedom in democracy, they're going to collapse, increase immigration, civil conflict, and then ultimately stupid foreign wars. And I'm not saying this happens in a sequence. I'm saying you'll see all five things, okay? But they may happen in different order. Any questions? What's this clear to you guys? Yeah, thank you. Is there any chance that the government tries to use a war to distract the people? Like they're trying to hide all of the collapse of their society and their country? Yeah, yeah, that's a great question. And the answer is that's what war is all for. It's to distract the people, right? Because if you don't distract the people, they'll come and revolt against you. So you either send them to a war, or you could have a French Revolution on your hands. Right, that's your option. War or revolution, I think war's the better option. That's why we're headed into a world at war. Okay, no, no, I'm saying like, if you don't send the people to war, they will revolt against you. So you send them off to war to distract them, to get rid of them. Okay, there's no right and wrong here, okay guys? Okay, alright, alright. Okay, I apologize, okay? But one thing that you will learn in my class is, there's no right and wrong. There's no logic, okay? It's not like, it is immoral to send people to war. I know that, thank you very much. Okay, but I'm trying to explain to you how power works. That's the theme of this course. I'm trying to explain to you how people in power think and behave, alright? And again, I keep on saying this. I don't know if I'm right, but what I'm doing is, I'm presenting a theory, a model that we can use to make predictions. And if these predictions work out, if it actually happens, then a model, there's some accuracy to our model. We'll have to refine our model, but there's some accuracy to it. But hey, hey, if tomorrow Trump, Putin, see, all get together and says, let's be best friends, then I'm wrong, right? Okay, so that's what we're trying to do in this class. We're not trying to argue what is right, What is wrong? What is just? Because quite honestly, it doesn't matter. Morel doesn't matter here. It's about power. We're trying to understand how the world works. And if we do that, then maybe we can work together and build a more just world. But first, we need to figure out how the world really, really works. Any more questions? Okay, great guys. So we'll continue this story next class. I'll see you guys next class. Okay."}

Last class, we did Greek theater. And remember, I said that Ischulis, Sophocles, and Eupides, they're really prophets of democracy. They see themselves as teachers who teach Athenians how to practice democracy. We also said that there are three major benefits to democracy. The first major benefit is kings are bad. Okay, kings have hubris and hubris creates all sorts of problems. So remember in the play, Integany by Sophocles, the king Creeon sentences Integany to death, even though it was unjust, that was because of hubris. Second major benefit of democracy is it is a gift from the gods that teaches citizens individual responsibility. Okay, so remember that in Eurostia, Ischle has told us that democracy is a gift from Athena in order to promote justice and truth in the world. And the third major benefit is democracy is really the best way to promote justice and truth in the world. If citizens come together and they deliberate and act in good faith, then the world and the world will be a better place. So that is the argument from the playwrights of Athens. Now, obviously there are people who disagree with this perspective. And one of the most famous opponents of democracy is Socrates. Socrates lived during the time of the Golden Age of Pericles and Athens, and he was a very vocal opponent of democracy for the following reason. In order to practice democracy properly, people need to access the truth. But to access the truth, you need to have reason. And his argument was that most people are not capable of exercising reason in their thinking, okay? And to prove this, every day he would be sitting outside the Agara, which is the marketplace of Athens, and this is where everyone came together. And he would spend all day arguing with people in something called a sacrilic dialogue and showing the flaws in your reasoning, okay? Showing you why you don't really understand the world when you think you do, okay? Trying to prove that you're ignorant. Okay, so let me give you a demonstration of what Sakuris did, okay? So give me a statement that is fundamentally and inherently true. Give me a statement that you think is fundamentally and inherently true. The earth is a spear, right? The earth is a spear. And so this is a statement that we think is true, right? And so what Sargadis would do is he would slowly and methodologically expose the flaws in this statement. So the first question for you is, what is a spear? Explain what a spear is. Okay, so your three-dimensional round shape entity, okay? And give me an example of a spear, a ball, right? So you're saying the earth is like a ball. Is that correct? It's all round, okay? And how do you know the statement is true? Who told you this? I mean, you can know a ball is a spear because you hold it in your hand, right? But you're not a god. you don't hold the earth in your hand. So how do you know it's true? Anyway, I can go on like this obviously for a very long time. And so this is what Socrates did, and this is what he called a psychotic dialogue. And actually we still use this in many different places, like for example law school. So in American law schools, if you ever make the stupid mistake of ever applying to law school and you get into law school, they will teach you using the psychotic dialogue. but the idea is to show the flaws in your reasoning. And obviously, if you get an argument for Socrates, you come out as a very mad person. So the reputation of Socrates and Athens during this time was he was either a, you guys see him as a bully, okay, he was an intellectual bully, or he was a clown, or the most common understanding of Socrates was he was a trickster. he tricked you into making statements that were illogical because fundamentally language does not capture the truth. Language is just a convention we have to in order for us to communicate, but it's not meant to reflect reality. And Sakhati was exposing the fundamental flaws in our language system. So any questions about this so far? All right, so to give you a sense of how Athenians thought about Socrates at that time, let me describe to you a play by Aristophanes. Okay, Aristophanes. Aristophanes was a very famous satirist in Athens. And he made fun of all the very famous individuals of Athens, including Pericles, who as we said, was the de facto king of Athens at this time, but also Cleon, who replaced Pericles as the leader of Athens. He also made some pheno-Socrates, okay? And the play was produced in 423 BCE, and the play was called The Clouds. So let me first explain the plot of The Clouds, and then we will interpret what it meant, okay? So in The Clouds, this is Athenian farmer, a normal citizen, and he's in a lot of trouble because his wife spends a lot of money. So he owes a lot of money to creditors. And his creditors are banging at the door and demanding their money back. So he comes up with this plan to get rid of his debts. There's a school called a thinkery. And it's run by a man named Socrates. The thinkery proposes to teach you reason, logic, truth, so that you can go and deceive jurors. You can basically go and manipulate people and deceive them in a trial to get out of your debts. So he wants to send his son to the thinkery to learn how to lie to juries. His son, who is a playboy, refuses because he says that Socrates, he's a cheat, he's a liar, he's a fraud. I refuse to go. The man decides to check out the thinkery by himself. He goes in and he sees Socrates, okay, hanging from a basket from the ceiling. And the man's curious, like, what are you doing up there? And Socrates says, well, up here I have a clearer and higher vision of the world. I can access truth better. Also from here, I can draw inspiration from the clouds, who are the true gods, okay? Not Zeus, not Heracles. The clouds are the true gods. And they're the ones who give me inspiration to come up with all these brilliant ideas. Okay? So the man in Socrates has, they have a very long conversation and he's completely convinced Socrates is a sage, okay? He's a philosopher. He runs back and he tells his son, you must go enroll in the thinkery and learn from Socrates, okay? So the man, the son decides, this is the path of least resistance. He goes to the thinkery, he becomes Socrates' student. Meanwhile, the man's creditors are banging the door and saying to him, where is my money? And the man says, the man is now gonna use all the tricks that Socrates taught him, okay? So what he says is, I don't owe you any money. And then the creditor says, you swore by Zeus that you would pay me back. The man says, oh, guess what? Zeus doesn't exist, okay? He's not a God. So I swore an oath to nothing. Therefore I owe you nothing. The creditors obviously gets angry and he leaves, okay? Now the son comes back and the first thing he does is start beating his father. And the father is like, why are you beating me son? And then the son says, Sakuris taught me to beat you. And the father's like, what? He didn't, why is he teaching you that? And the son says, he taught me justice. Now when I was young, did you beat me? The father says, yes, of course I beat you because you were a naughty boy. And then the son says, therefore I can now beat you because you're a naughty person for refusing to pay back your creditors. Okay, the man gets very angry and he decides to go burn down the thinkery with some of these inside it, okay? And that's how the play ends. Now, this is not a great play, okay? This is not a famous play of Greece, but it tells you what Athenian's thought of Socrates at this time, okay? And it shows us that Athenians didn't think much of Socrates, he worships the clouds, right? Which is nothing. So what they're saying is Socrates makes things out of finair, okay? He's just a fraud, he's a manipulator, he's a liar. But Socrates did have a lot of fans. specifically people who really hated democracy. And so the people who really, really hated democracy were the children of the rich. These were aristocrats, born into the wealthiest, most noble, aristocratic families of Athens, who hated the fact that the normal people thought they were their equals. So what Sargadis did was he taught them basically mental or linguistic kung fu, right? To go beat up these commoners who dare to think they're equals. One most famous, the most famous of Socrates students included Plato, who we all know, but also Alcubaites, who was one of the wealthiest members of Athenian society, and actually became leader of Athens as well. Okay, so Socrates had his fans, and because Athens was such a wealthy and open and tolerant society, they allowed Socrates to basically do whatever he wanted, okay? Until 404 BC. This was the year that Athens lost the Peloponnesian War to Sparta, okay? And when Athens lost the war, Sparta did not burn Athens down. Sparta had the right to burn Athens down, but it did not, okay? Instead, Athens imposed a dictatorship called the 30 tyrants. And the 30 tyrants came from the wealthiest families of Athens, who also happened to be students of Socrates. Socrates did not actually participate in a tyranny. Socrates refused to participate in a tyranny, but there were many of these tyrants who were Socrates students. And they were terrible people. They killed at least 5% of the Athenian population. They stole a lot of wealth. And they were so terrible that ultimately, the Athenian people revolted against them and reinstalled their democracy. So when the Taiwanese was overthrown, the 30 Titans were exiled, but most people were given pregnancy. they were forgiven if they participated in the regime. Then what happens next is very strange. In 399 BCE, Socrates is put on trial. Remember, this is after the democracy is reinstated, and this is when people who participated in the tyranny were forgiven, okay? But in 399 BCE, Socrates was put on trial. He was put on trial and charged with two crimes. The first is impiety, okay, which basically means he was insulting the gods of Athens, including Zeus, which is what he did in the play clouds, okay? The second is corrupting the youth of Athens, okay? Basically miseducating the youth of Athens, which is also what he did in the clouds, okay? So it almost seems like this entire trial was a cruel joke put on by the people of Athens to teach Socrates a lesson, okay? Does that make sense? So the people of Athens expected Socrates to apologize, make some jokes, be funny, and then also forgiven, right? During the trial, Socrates refused to defend himself. What he said was this, I am not a good speaker. I am bad with words. I'm just a poor person, okay? Who comes from a poor family who spends every day seeing out the truth. I spend all my time seeing out the truth, thinking about the truth that I have no time to practice rhetoric. I'm not good with words. Also, I should not have to defend myself because you're all capable of reason, you're all capable of logic. Therefore, if you just think for yourself, you realize I'm not guilty. I have absolutely nothing, I have absolutely nothing to do with the 30 tyrants. I spent all my life trying to help Athens. Therefore, if you're stupid, you will vote me guilty. If you're stupid, there's nothing I can do about it. So obviously, the jury was insulted by his speech and they voted out of 500 people, 280 to 220, they voted that he is guilty. They declared he was guilty of these two charges. Now as you can see, it's still a pretty close vote. I mean, Socrates was basically being a jerk during a trial and they still, they voted him guilty, but it was a pretty close trial, 280 to 220. Now, the second part of the trial is, if you're found guilty, they have to figure out what your punishment is. So the jury asked Socrates to propose a punishment for his crimes. And then what Socrates said was, you have found me guilty. And the reason why you found me guilty is because I speak the truth. I may dad fly, okay? Dad fly. I go around and I point out the nasty truths of Athenian society. I put a mirror to your face and I show you your warts, your pimples, your ugliness. Therefore you hate me. But what I've been doing all my life has been for the good and betterment of Athens. I'm a public servant. I am the most selfless public servant, okay? Because I speak the truth, and by showing the truth, I make you a better person. Therefore I think a judge's punishment would be a pension. Okay? You guys should pay me to retire in peace. But you know what? I'm a generous and forgiving individual. Therefore, if you don't want to give me a pension, I won't understand. Therefore, I am willing to pay a small fine, okay? I'll pay a fine, okay? And then we're good. How about that? And again, the Finney and Jurors were piss hot, right? So they voted to condemn him to death by chicken and hammock, okay? They basically gave him the death penalty. As he did so, they came to realize that they were perhaps tricked by Socrates, okay? Socrates was 70 years old. That's very old for back then, okay? 70 years old was probably the age limit back then. He really didn't have much to live for. And here's the opportunity for Socrates to be a martyr for the truth, right? All his life, he's been trying to convince people democracy does not work because people are incapable of reasoning out the truth. And what this trial shows us is he was correct. All right, does that make sense? So in many ways, you can make the argument that for Socrates, this trial was a type of performance art. He was a performance artist. Okay? And so the people of Athens realized that They were probably tricked and they were trying to get out of condemning Socrates to death. But Socrates insisted. And it came to a point where Socrates was just left alone and he had to demand to be given hemlock. And he had to administer the hemlock by himself. And so when he drank it, he died. Now, after his death, Socrates remained an extremely controversial individual in Athens. And he had a student, Plato, who was maybe 28, 29 at the time, his mentor died. And he loved Socrates. And he committed the rest of his life to restoring and redeeming the reputation of Socrates. So when he was 40 years old, he founded a school called The Academy, which was inspired by the vision of Socrates as a philosopher who to stop the truth. In 375 BCE, he wrote a book called The Republic. And The Republic is the most famous of Plato's work. It is arguably the greatest work of Western philosophy. And many today considered The Republic the greatest book ever written. There are people in this world who read The Republic and it forever transforms the way they see the world. It's a life-transforming event to read The Republic. And next semester, we will actually read the republic together. But let me give you a quick introduction to the republic. So in the republic, there's a very famous metaphor. It's called Allagoy of the Cave. And this is really the most famous Allagoy, or metaphor, or analogy, in Western thought by far. Nothing comes second to this. So before I start the Allagoy of the Cave, are there any questions so far about what I've discussed? anything unclear, anything you would like to question or doubt or argue with, if I continue with the allegory of the cave. Okay, clear so far? All right, so this is the allegory. Imagine a cave deep under the earth. Okay, there's a cave. Now in this cave at the back there's a large fire that shines light into this cave. Okay? There are these prisoners who are chained to the floor and they're chained so that they cannot move their necks. They can't move around. They can't move. The only thing they can do is steer at a wall in front of them. That's the only thing they can do. Now, there are these people behind them who are like puppeteers. They hold up cardboard pictures of maybe rats and birds. and the fire will project these images onto the wall. And so these people who, again, cannot move around and they're going to see the wall in front of them, they come to think that this wall is the truth. It's the only reality that exists. And they start naming things that they see and that creates language. And they like to play games and try to figure out who can create the best language, okay? And then they give awards to the people who create the best language, who are playwrights, right? So what Plato is saying is that we may honor art and poetry and drama, but they're all lies. Now, one day, for whatever reason, we don't know why, but one man finds his chains are loosened. And he's able to get up. Okay? And he swims around, and he sees a light coming from the top. So he's curious, and he climbs all the way to the top, and he's now outside in the free world. Okay? And it's painful because his eyes are not trained to see the sunlight. Okay? So the sunlight, it's like burning him. Okay? It's like burning him alive. And so at first, all he's doing is stare at the ground and see, he's seeing reflections in the pond, in the pool. But then he slowly automatizes himself to the sunlight and he starts to see the world around him. And it's beautiful, okay? But it's so beautiful that it's beyond language. He doesn't have the language to describe this world that he's in, okay? This is beyond language. Then finally, he develops the courage to stare up in the sky and he sees the sun, okay? The sun. And he is amazed by how the sun is a source of all life. And now, for the first time, he fully understands the truth of the world, okay? And when he does, he is seized by regret because he remembers he has all these friends who are still trapped in prison in the cave and he pities them. So he swears that he will, even though he loves where he is, he will still venture back into the cave in order to show people the truth of the world and to tell them that you've been living a lie all your life, okay? So he goes back into the cave. Now remember, his eyes are now accustomed to sunlight. So in the cave, it's all dark. So he stumbles around. He stumbles around, he falls, and he hurts himself, okay? And then he goes and talks to the person and says, and tells them, hey, I've been to the outside world. I've been to the sunlight. I know what truth is. And then they're like, can you describe to us what it's like then? And he can't do it, okay? And then they're like, tell us what you see on the wall. And because he's been so accustomed to truth, he can no longer use human language to describe anything. Okay? And so the people are convinced, utterly convinced. He's an idiot, he's insane, he's a clown. And so they refuse to follow him. And at some point, because he insists on revealing the truth to them, They kill him. Okay? That's the allegory of the cave. Okay? And you'll remember this allegory for the rest of your life. Now this allegory is powerful for three reasons. Okay? And I want you to remember these three reasons because we will go into them later on in the course. The first reason is who's the man who goes out in the sunlight and sees the truth? It's obviously Socrates, right? So with this allegory Plato redeems the reputation of Socrates, right? Because remember before Socrates was despised, he was laughed at by the Athenians. And what this allegory is saying is that's because Socrates is a philosopher of the truth, okay? And people cannot deal with the truth. So that's why today we celebrate Socrates as the greatest philosopher who ever lived. Not only that, but we consider him the first philosopher, even though he was not the first philosopher, okay? So that's the power of the allegory of the cave. This image, forever transforms the way humanity understands and perceives Socrates. That's the first thing. One thing is, this allegory becomes so powerful that in the imagination of Christians, Socrates becomes Jesus, right? Doesn't make sense. Socrates is Jesus for Christians because Jesus was God and he came down to our world in order to speak the truth. And because we fear the truth, we killed him. So for Christians, allegory of the cave is really the story of Jesus as well, another martyr for the truth. But the last thing is this allegory of the cave becomes the framework for Christianity. It becomes an integral framework for the religion of Christianity. So let me show you how. So this is an allegory, and behind the allegory, there is an understanding of reality, a philosophy, a religion, okay? So here is the Platonic understanding of the world. There's something called the form of the good. And obviously the metaphor would be the sun, okay? And the form of the good is a source of everything. It's a source of all truth. It is the truth. It's called the form of the good. And emanating from the form of the good are concepts and ideals that structure the universe. And they are reason, beauty, and truth, and injustice. And there are others. But these are the main ones, reason, truth, beauty, and justice. They emanate from the form of the good. And then emanating from these concepts or these forms that are perfect, okay? So for example, maybe the perfect horse, which represents beauty, okay? Or the perfect woman who represents justice and beauty as well, okay? But this is all perfection. And from this higher world comes, or the lesser world, the reality we live in. So everything that we see here, The driving that we are here is only imitation, a shadow of this world, okay? Does that make sense? Immutation. So there are horses, but these horses are just copies of that perfect horse up there. So the major difference is in this world, this world is eternal. It has always existed and it will always exist. It's eternal. Second is it is immutable. Immutable, immutable just means it will never change. And the reason why is it's perfect. So these are three distinct qualities of this higher world, eternal, immaculate, and perfect. And everything down here is basically the complete opposite. We will all die, we'll all feel pain. But up there, no one feels any pain, no one dies. It's all perfect. Does that make sense? Guess what guys, what is this? This is a Christian universe, right? This is God. This is heaven. This is earth. Okay, doesn't make sense. This is the allegory of the cave. And you can see how it does these three things. It redeems the reputation of Sarcoteans. It gives Christians an understanding of Jesus. And it becomes the framework from which Christians will build their understanding of the world. becomes the basis of the Christian religion. So Plato is the real founder of the Christian religion, not Jesus. And we will go more into this when we discuss Christianity in the future. Any questions? You look confused. Just ask any question. Let's start having a discussion. Because I know this is a lot. Let's try to unpack it. Oh, great. OK. The Republic. Okay, so the republic isn't really about the allegor of the cave. Okay, the allegor of the cave actually appears in the republic. The republic itself, Plato is trying to answer the question, what is a good society? Okay, what is a good society? That's the question he's trying to answer, because it's clearly not democracy. Because democracy kills Socrates, okay? So it's clearly not democracy. So what makes a good society? And the answer is, it's a society that's based on justice. It's a society that's based on justice. But then what is justice? It's truth. But then what's truth? Well, truth is the form of the good. Then what's the form of the good? It is the thing that philosophers can access for their own reasoning. Therefore, a good society is one that is ruled by philosopher kings because they're the only ones who can access the truth, okay? And this society that's perfect, he calls the Republic. That's why it's called the Republic. The Republic, and we'll read this again next semester is, it's really trying to figure out what makes a good society, okay? And to further his argument, Plato uses the allegor of the cave. And like, listen, 50 years from now, you will still remember the allegro de cave. Maybe you will remember the Charles Sargotes or anything else you've learned in this class, but you will definitely remember the allegro de cave, because it's embedded. First of all, it's a beautiful metaphor, but it's also embedded in our society. Okay? So does that answer your question, Echo? Okay, do you have more questions? All right, something else I want to explain is, Okay, some might be interested as to why Plato is considered the greatest philosopher of all time, okay? All right, so it's not because he's the best. It's not because he's the best. I would say there are three good reasons why he's so influential today. The first is Plato, the way he writes, it's unique and original to him. Plato originally trained as a playwright. So he wanted to be ischelous, he wanted to be Sophocles, Uphidias, because everyone wanted to be a playwright in Athens, it was the highest honor. So he learned the art of dialogue, because dialogue is the basis for theater. And so what he did that was innovative, and no one did this before it was, he basically took the dialogue of the stage, and he transferred onto the page. So when you read Plato, it's actually a lot of fun. because it's basically Socrates, his main character, having arguments and conversations with other people. So in terms of readability, Plato is definitely probably one of the most readable philosophers. He's definitely the most readable, famous philosopher. Later on in the semester, we will talk about Emmanuel Cot and Hegel, and they are not readable. They're just not. But anyone can read Plato and enjoy Plato. So his readability, the originality of his writing is one really good reason why he remains so popular today. Second is he is extremely anti-democratic. His thinking is because remember, the most traumatic event in his life was the death of his mentor Socrates. And so it's the thing in democracy who killed his mentor. So he passionately hates democracy. OK? Well, you know who else hates democracy? Kings hate democracy. And for most of human history, kings rule the world, right? But what's amazing about Plato is he's the only writer in human history who has been read continuously for 2,000 years. Doesn't make sense. We lost Homer for a bit. We lost the playwrights, Ischle, Sothrages, and Eupades for a long time. But Plato has always been read continuously. And he's been the most, and as a result, because it's easy to access Plato, he's become the most influential philosopher all the time. Okay, doesn't make sense. And third of all was his academy. Okay, and the academy in Athens at that time, It's like Harvard, right, or Oxford today. It's a place where all the elite children went. So his students were the most powerful people in the world, basically. And his most famous student was Aristotle. And as we'll discuss in future classes, Aristotle is the one who basically packaged and promoted Greek culture. and Plato became a very important individual in the spreading of Greek culture. In fact, he was basically the main hero in this process. So does that make sense? Feel free to argue with me by the way. I mean, if you feel like I've said anything controversial or you disagree with, let me know and I will rebut. We can have a stochastic dialogue. Any more questions? Ask a question, okay? Okay, that's a great question, okay? What are the influences of Plato, okay? So you can make the argument that Socrates was not that much of an intellectual influence on Plato, and the reason why is, Murk, Socrates questioned your wisdom, but he himself did not propose any of his own theories, okay? So, right. So what we know is this. First of all, during this time, this was the golden age of Greek philosophy, right? You had lots of philosophers in different polices, different places, proposing all these wonderful theories. So Plato definitely had access to them. Plus they were all friends, okay? And we also know this world of Greek thought was heavily influenced by Egypt, right? Because Egypt was really the epicenter of learning and philosophy at this time. And Egypt was actually very close to Greece. Also Mesopotamia, right? The Persians, okay? So, 399 BC, Socrates died, and then Plato spends the next 12 years traveling around the world. And while he's traveling, he's absorbing lots of different philosophy, okay? So, look, we don't have access to Egyptian sources, right? So we don't know what sources would influence Plato. But we know the Egyptians heavily influenced the Greeks. So we can make the assumption that the Egyptians were heavily influenced on Plato, as well as Mesopotamia, as well as the other Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and Democratus. And so what's really important is, Athens at this time was not an isolated society. was part of a larger intellectual landscape. And a lot of these places had richer intellectual histories than Athens. Egypt, definitely. Mesopotamia. So does that answer your question? The answer is we don't know. And the reason, again, is most of this is lost to us. I'm sure there were philosophers at this time who were the equal of Plato in terms of originality. But we don't know who these people were. Because remember, citizenship, it's not really just about changing the past. It's also about eliminating most of the past. It was very common for Greeks to think they should rule the world. It was just very common. So Plato himself actually went to a place called Syracuse. Syracuse is a city on the island of Sicily. It's very prosperous and the king of Syracuse invited Plato to come counsel him on how to be a tyrant, a good tyrant, right? He wanted to be like a philosopher king. And then Plato basically said to him, well you should let me be the king, and then you will have a philosopher king. And of course, the, you know, some of you didn't like this idea, so he almost killed Plato, okay? But Plato had very, again, Plato has very wealthy friends, and he was very rich himself, so he basically ransomed his way out of Syracuse. So as a politician, as a practitioner of his philosophy, he's terrible. He tried his philosophy in Syracuse, didn't work out, pissed off a lot of people. But everyone wanted to be a philosopher king. Any more questions? So next class, we will do the rise of Macedonia. So remember, these are ideas that are being incubated in Athens and in Greece at this time. But ultimately these ideas conquer the world. Great theater, great philosophy spread around the world. And the main reason is Macedonia. The main reason are two individuals, Philip II of Macedonia and Alexander the Great. who together will create the Hellenistic Empire. And this is why Greek culture will spread around the world and become the basis of Western civilization."}

So let's review where we are. We are discussing or exploring why the United States would want to invade Iran. And so far, we have two good reasons. The first good reason is called the Israel lobby. There are in the Israel lobby millions of Christian Zionists who believe that a conflict in the Middle East, especially between Israel and Iran, will bring Jesus back to earth. They want their God, Jesus, to return to earth, and they believe that a war in the Middle East will force him to return. That's the first reason. Second reason is the idea of an empire. America is an empire, And as an empire, it has a lot of privileges. For example, it can just print as much money as it want, right, US dollars. Right now, America is $34 trillion in debt, and the debt is growing by $2 every two months. America can do this as long as it is an empire, as long as people fear America. But as we discussed last class, With Putin's invasion of Ukraine, people are now starting to rebel against the empire, and therefore America must demonstrate it still is the military hegemon of the world, and therefore it can do this by invading Iran. Today we look at the third and final force driving conflict in Middle East, and it's really the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Most people think that Iran's major enemy in the Middle East is Israel. In fact, Iran's major enemy is Saudi Arabia. These two are bitter rivals. And to understand why, we have to look at their history. So the year is 1979. And at the start of 1979, Saudi Arabia and Iran and Iran are very good friends. So let's look at a map of the Middle East. Iran is here, it's next to Iraq. Saudi Arabia is down here, then this is Egypt. You have Yemen here, Oman. This is the Strait of Homoos and this is the Suez Canal, the Red Sea basically. And in 1979, Saudi Arabia and Iran were very good friends. They had a lot of similarities. They were both monarchies. They were ruled by a king. They were secular. They relied on American power to defend itself. And they were both oil exporters, both very prosperous oil exporters. But then in 1979, a political earthquake radically changed the landscape of the Middle East. In 1979, there was a bottom-up revolution called the Islamic Revolution. Before 1979, there was a general consensus agreement in the Middle East that religion and politics would be separated. But in 1979, the people in Iran demanded three things. First, they demanded that the king, they will not be ruled by a king. That's the first demand. Second is that the US should not interfere in domestic politics. Remember that before the king, the Shah, were supported by the American military. And the third demand is that as a Muslim people, as people who believe in the Islamic religion, the government should be focused on Islamic law. So in a referendum, 98% of the people of Iran voted to install an Islamic Republic to replace their monarchy. And this was complete unexpected and this caused an earthquake throughout the Middle East. In November of 1979, 600 religious extremists tried to besiege Mecca, okay? Mecca is the holiest city in the Islamic religion because it's the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. 600 extremists tried to take the city over and demand three things, okay? That the Saudi Arabian monarchy should advocate. The United States should remove itself from the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia should be governed by Islamic law. Now, this revolt was crushed by the military But from that day on, Iran and Saudi Arabia became better enemies because they were both trying to install their vision of Islam on the Middle East. So this rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia took three forms. The first form is religious. So even though they're both Muslim countries, Islamic countries, they have different versions of the religion. So Saudi Arabia is Sunni, and Iran is Shi'at. Now, you may ask what the difference between these two different branches of the religion are. And the answer is no one actually knows. It's a very complicated issue. The major difference is this. In 610, the prophet Muhammad in Medina, in the city of Medina, he had a vision to found a new religion called Islam. And he spread this religion throughout the Middle East, throughout the Arab world, for ever transforming the Middle East. When he died, there's a problem of secession, who would succeed the prophet as the leader of the religion. The Shi'a people believe that only people of Muhammad's bloodline can be the leaders of the religion. The Sunni disagreed and said that anyone who proved himself competent and faithful to religion could be the leader. And so for hundreds of years, these two groups, the Sunni and the Shia, fought a war over the succession. And this led to a bitter rivalry that's lasted to this day, okay? Now the majority of people in the world, about 8%, are Sunni, okay? The majority of Muslims in the world are Sunni. 10% are Shia. So what is important is that Saudi Arabia is a Sunni country, and Iran is a Shia country. And at the time of the revolution, Iran dedicated itself, committed itself, to spreading the Shia revolution throughout the world. Now, Saudi Arabia considers itself the leader of the Islamic world because it is home to both Mecca and Medina, which are the two holiest cities in the entire Islamic religion. As you may know, there's a requirement that as a Muslim, you must take a hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina once in your lifetime. And because Saudi Arabia controls Mecca and Medina, that's really the source of Saudi Arabia's authority over the Islamic world. Iran says, Iran argues that because Saudi Arabia is ruled by a king, that's anti-Muslim. And because United States is defended by the US military, that's also anti-Muslim. Saudi Arabia is a heresy, okay? So Iran is dedicated itself to subverting Saudi Arabia's authority. Okay, so this is all makes sense so far. Okay, now Saudi Arabia is Sunni and it practices the most extreme form of Sunni religion called Wahhabism, okay? Wahhabism. In 1744, the Wahhabis, which again are the most extreme Islamic group, made an alliance with the Al-Sahd family of Saudi Arabia. And the agreement was this, that the Wahhabis could, the Wahhabism would become the national religion of Saudi Arabia, and the Wahhabis would swear allegiance to the Al-Sahd family. Okay? But in the 1930s, oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia. In fact, Saudi Arabia proved to have the most valuable oil resources in all the world. Okay? And at that time, as the world was modernizing, oil was becoming more and more important. And so that made Saudi Arabia extremely wealthy. And as it became more and more wealthy, it tried to become more western, more secular, more progressive, more modern, which brought it into conflict with the Wahhabi. Now, Wahhabism accounts for 20 to 40% of all the people in Saudi Arabia. So it is a very significant group. important, Wahhabi people tend to be extremely fanatical. So for example in 1979, the people who laid siege to Mecca were Wahhabis. And Wahhabis were also responsible for terrorist attacks against tourists, against foreigners in Saudi Arabia. So Saudi Arabia has always had this problem with the Wahhabis and the way that Saudi Arabia has tried to resolve the conflict is to export the religion of Wahhabism throughout the world. So for example, Osama bin Laden was a Saudi citizen responsible for spreading Wahhabism in Afghanistan and that's what started Al-Qaeda. So Saudi Arabia is trying to export Wahhabism, Iran is trying to export the Shi'ite religion, and so they come to call with each other. So the first source of tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia is over religion. Second is economical. And what that means is that both countries are oil exporters. In fact, Saudi Arabia is completely reliant on oil for its economy. 40% of Saudi Arabia's economy GDP is based on oil exports. Saudi Arabia is number one oil exporter in the world. 75% of government revenues comes from its oil exports. In other words, Saudi Arabia does not actually collect taxes from its citizens. It just sells oil. Iran also sells oil. It's the number four oil exporting in the world, but it's less reliant on oil because it has a diversified economy, meaning that it has very strong human capital. It has a very well-educated population that does all sorts of different activities, science, art, education. So Saudi Arabia for the longest time has been trying to control the price of oil in order to maximize profits. For example, it wants to cut back production in order to increase the price of oil, which will increase profits. But Iran often doesn't cooperate because Iran is trying to sell as much oil as possible in order to boost its economy. So there's economic conflict between these two countries. And the third and final conflict is geopolitical. And geopolitical means that both countries are trying to exert as much influence as possible over the Middle East. Now, Iran is trying to exert influence over the Middle East because after the revolution in 1979, many countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United States, encourage Iraq to invade Iran. And this invasion called the Iraq-Iran War lasted eight years and it caused a lives of millions of Iranians. And from then on, Iran has adopted a policy of aggressive intervention in the Middle East in order to distract the United States and Israel. So for example, in Israel, there two groups opposing Israel Hamas and Pesplah and they're both financed and supported politically by Iran and the point of doing this is to distract Israel. Now Saudi Arabia is trying to exert influence over the Middle East because as a number one oil exporter it needs to control shipping lanes. It needs to control this area and this area, the straight-from-move and the source canal. And 40% of all the world's oil passes through these two straights and they go mainly to East Asia, China, South Korea and Japan mainly. So because of these geopolitical tensions, Iran and Saudi Arabia have fought three proxy wars. They fought three shadow wars. The first is in Iraq. And now in Iraq, as you know, in 2003, America invaded Iraq and destroyed the country. And after they destroyed the country, there's a power vacuum. And so, basically, Iran came in and tried to take over the country. And it could do so because two-thirds of the population were Shi'at, and therefore they had affinity with Iran. And a third were Sunnis. So what happened was that to counter the Iranian influence in Iraq, Saudi Arabia started to finance the one-third of the Sunnis against the Shia. So there was a very violent civil war fought in Iraq after the invasion. Many people also believe that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the financing of the Islamic State, or ISIS, because ISIS really hates the Shia religion. But over time, because Iran has been so much more effective in projecting its power than Saudi Arabia, basically Iran now controls much of Iraq. So in this first war, Iran defeated Saudi Arabia. Then they found another war in Syria. serious leader Assad faced rebellion. And Saudi Arabia, America, Israel support the rebels against Assad. And Iran came in to support Assad, as well as Russia. And over time, Assad was able to crush the rebellion. So in the second proxy war, Iran won as well. Now, there's another proxy war in Yemen, okay? And it started in 2016. So the wars in Iraq and Syria, they were important to Saudi Arabia, but they didn't really threaten Saudi Arabia. But this war in Yemen did threaten Saudi Arabia, okay? So for the longest time, Saudi Arabia supported the Yemen local leadership. And then there was a rebellion by the Houthis, okay? The Houthis. The Houthis were Shia villagers who lived in the mountains. And they were trying to overthrow the government. And Saudi Arabia was afraid that the Houthis would become France-R Iran. So Saudi Arabia launched a massive invasion of Yemen. It was 150,000 Saudi Arabian troops. They had war planes. They were backed by the most advanced American weapons and technology, okay? They also had a coalition of about 30 nations, including Egypt and the UAE. The Saudi Arabia named this operation Decisive Storm, right? right, which sounds like desert storm. And the strategy they use is what we call shock and awe. And shock and awe is basically we have so many bombs, we have so many airplanes, we have so many soldiers that we can in about a week's time destroy you, okay? So go in, go fast, be decisive, destroy your enemy. Unfortunately, this, for Saudi Arabia, this did not work. And the reason why is, first of all, the Houthis were in the mountains. And so your bombs didn't really stop them. In fact, all your bombs did was make them really angry. Because if you're bombs, you were killing civilians. So you're basically uniting the entire population against you. That's the first problem. Second problem is that the Houthis are in the mountains. But Saudi Arabia has oil fields. And guess what, guys? It's really, really easy to blow up oil fields. So that's what the Houthis are doing. They were sending these cheap drones. They might cost $1,000, $10,000. And they would blow up oil fields and ports. Saudi Arabia has another problem. Saudi Arabia has no fresh water. It's in the desert. It is a desert. No water guys, no rivers. So it relies entirely on desalination plants. Okay, and this is extremely impressive technology, right? It takes salt water, sea water, and turn it into fresh water. It's very impressive, but it's on the coast. And guess what guys, the coast, so Iran can blow up these plants and the Houthis can blow up these plants as well. Okay? So Saudi Arabia basically lost this war because the Houthis could inflict massive economic damage on Saudi Arabia. So from this war, Saudi Arabia learned three things. The first thing it learned is that if it wants to defeat their enemies, the Houthis, the Syrians, and the Iraqis, they also need to be able to defeat Iraq. That's the first thing they learned. Secondly, they learn is that their economy is extremely vulnerable to attack. At any point Iran, with its missiles and drones, could destroy the entire Saudi Arabian economy. It can easily blow up all the oil fields and the desalination plants. So the third thing that Saudi Arabia learned from all this is we really need America to fight Iran for us. In the long term, that's the only way we're gonna survive as a nation. We need to feed Iran, and we can't do it by ourselves. We need America to do it for us. Unfortunately for Saudi Arabia, in 2001, 9-11 happened, right? 15 of the 19 hijackers were in the US, citizens of Saudi Arabia, which meant that America was very unhappy with Saudi Arabia. Okay? Americans didn't like Saudi Arabia. Americans also knew that there were a lot of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. The other thing that happened is in 2003, America invaded Iraq. Saudi Arabia tried to exert as much influence as possible in Washington D.C. to stop the war because they knew that if America invented Iraq, it would make Iran more powerful. Now as you know, Saudi Arabia could not stop the war. In 2008, Barack Obama came into the office and Barack Obama's understanding of the world was that, okay, the Middle East is a complete mess and it's hopeless. I don't really want to deal with the Middle East. Plus, China is rising. The main threat to American power in the future will be East Asia. So he proposed something called the Asia Pivot, which is to transfer American military resources from the Middle East to East Asia to counter the threat of China. But to do that, you needed to reduce tensions in the Middle East. And so in 2015, he made a deal with Iran called the Iran Nuclear Deal. And the deal was basically, Obama said to Iran, listen, I know you're trying to develop nuclear weapons. So what we're going to do is, if you promise to not develop nuclear weapons, we will lift economic sanctions on you so that you can prosper. And Iran said, yes. And this really scared Saudi Arabia because if America leaves the Middle East and broke with a piece where we read, then Saudi Arabia would be extremely vulnerable. Okay. So Saudi Arabia became very, very desperate. Its very existence was threatened. Also, the economic outlook for Saudi Arabia was not that great. Remember, the entire economy depended on oil. But guess what guys, oil is a finite resource. Eventually, you're going to run out of oil. Now, if you're optimistic, you'll be like, well, Saudi Arabia would run out of oil in about 70 years time, or 80 years time. But there are also some people who believe that Saudi Arabia will run up oil in about 10 years time and If Saudi Arabia has no oil Then it's an entire economy collapses Okay, then you also have a problem with global warming, right? Climate change You also have a problem with the entire global economy is slowing down therefore the demand for oil is is decreasing. So the economic outlook for Saudi Arabia, it's extremely grim, okay? And that's why in 2017, Saudi Arabia appointed a new leader called Mohamed bin Salman, okay? The Crown Prince, whoever calls MBS. And MBS promised to be a new leader. He was young, he was progressive, he wanted women to drive, he wanted young people to go to the movie theater, okay? And he proposed a new vision for Saudi Arabia called Vision 2030. But MBS's most important achievement is that he became friends with the new president Donald Trump, okay? So in 2016, Donald Trump became president of the United States. And MBS decided that this is an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to reset relations with America. So Trump, his first trip outside of the United States, was to Saudi Arabia. That was his first achievement. Second achievement is that MBS became best friends with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. And Jared Kushner was Trump's Middle East advisor, and his job was to bring peace to the Middle East, mainly between Israel and the Arab countries. And to that extent, Kushner did a great job because MBS helped him. So his major achievement is something called the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords is just to establish peace between Israel and the Arab countries so that they can unite against Iran together. So MBS was looking very good. But then in 2018, he did something that scared the world. Okay? MBS was a visionary. He had a plan for where to take Saudi Arabia. He wanted to modernize Saudi Arabia, but he was also young. He was a tyrant. He did not like people who criticized him. Okay? So there's a journalist named Jamal Khashoggi who worked for the Washington Post and who was a permanent resident of the United States. He was a Saudi national. And MBS hadn't killed. And this caused an international uproar. The CIA, the US government conducted investigation. And they determined there was MBS who ordered the assassination. Trump protected MBS. And then the most important thing that Trump did was in January 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of a man named Qasam Salamani, who is considered to be the second most powerful man in Iran after the Ayatollah, the supreme religious leader of the country. It is Qasam Salamani who was responsible for Iran's policies in the Iraq war, the Syria war, and in the Yemen war. So from the perspective of Saudi Arabia, Qasem Soleimani is public enemy number one. He is the greatest threat to Saudi Arabia. Now, before, okay, America had many opportunities to assassinate Qasem Soleimani. George W. Bush had the opportunity, Barack Obama had the opportunity, and both believe that doing so would cause basically World War III, okay? Because if you kill the number two leader of Iran, Iran would have no choice but to go to war with you. And that's why they both refrain from killing Qasem Salamani. In fact, when Trump made the decision to assassinate Salamani, the entire military was stunned. They couldn't believe this was happening. So how does this happen? Okay, so for some time, there was some conflict between US soldiers and Shia militiamen in Iraq. And the Pentagon felt it had to act, okay? So in these situations, they had to go to the president and present options to the president of how best to respond. And usually the Pentagon will design the choices so that the president does what the Pentagon thinks it's best. So an example is that if I'm in the military and I go to Trump, I give you three choices. The first choice is A, one, let's do nothing. Two is what you should do. And three is let's blow up the world. So when I present these three options to you, you as a president being wise and strategic, will obviously always pick option two, right? What you should do, what the military suggests you should do, okay? Unfortunately, in this instance, Trump chose option three. Let's vote the world, guys. And so they assassinated Qassam Salamanio, okay? So in other words, it is very likely that if Trump that if Trump stayed a second term, the United States would have gone to war with Iran given how things were progressing. MBS was so happy about all this that he once bragged privately to a friend that, oh, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, the man responsible for all Middle East policies? Well, he's in my pocket, meaning I own him. Okay? And the evidence that suggests this is that after Trump left office, after Jared Kushner left office, Jared Kushner set up a private equity fund. And MBS and the Saudi government invested $2 billion into the fund. Okay? Does that make sense? So we don't know how, we don't know this for sure, but it seems like Trump is doing exactly what the Saudis want, which is to inflame tensions with Iran, okay? And this suggests that if in November, Trump wins a second term, It is very possible that Trump will declare war on Iran, or at the very least, continue to escalate tensions with Iran, which will very likely lead to World War III. So in that respect, the election in November, whether or not Trump comes back into office, is one of the most consequential elections. Okay? Does that make sense, guys? Okay, any questions? Anything you want me to clarify before we end class? Okay, so what we will do next class is figure out if Trump will win in November. And I will make the argument to you that it is almost very certain, very likely that he will win in November. Okay? So we will examine why next class."}
{"video_id": "LsRGvKxfLts", "title": "Geo-Strategy #7:  Who Killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi?", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsRGvKxfLts", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 2971.463, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 5529, "text": "Okay, so let's start class and start to think about the question, how and why did the Iranian president, Ibrahim Raisi, die? So when you do history or you do analysis about current events, you're always going going to have, you're always going to encounter three major problems. The first major problem is that there's very little information that you can work with. Truth is very limited. That's the first problem. problem is that the information that you have may not be true. Okay? So there's also misinformation. That's the second problem. And the third problem is that there's always going to be an official narrative that the media, the government publishes. And it may not be true. But it's the one that people accept. So the challenge for us today is we know that the Iranian president, Ibrahim Reiji, died. And we will have to use analysis, game theory analysis, to figure out how he died and who might have killed him. Does that make sense? But the problem again is we are working with very limited information that the Iranian government chooses to disclose to the public. So what do we know? We know that as a fact that on May 19th, the Iranian president was in Azerbaijan for a dem opening ceremony. And then he got into his helicopter and was flying back into the country. And when it was flying back, there was an accident that caused the helicopter to crash, killing all nine people on board, including the president, the foreign minister, three crew members, the governor of a province, province, a local religious leader, the bodyguard of the president, and the head of the president's security detail. Okay, so all nine people died. And we have reason to believe that the most probable reason is an accident, okay? That this was an accident, that it was bad weather, there's a fog, the pilot couldn't really see and he crashed into the mountain. And the evidence for this is that, one, this happens a lot. For example, in 2020, the very famous basketball player, Kobe Bryant, he died in a helicopter crash along with his daughter, okay? So this actually happens a lot. The second piece of evidence is that the helicopter they were flying in is very old. It was basically an American helicopter that they started to use in the 70s. And after the revolution, America refused to cooperate with Iran, so they could never actually maintain the helicopter. So maybe it was just a malfunction, okay? So these are two compelling reasons why most people believe this is an accident. And this is, again, probably the cost that will go down in history. But game theory analysis requires us to explore other possibilities. So there are two other possibilities. Second possibility is foreign adversary, which means that either the United States or Israel or even possibly Azerbaijan, but a foreign adversary was responsible for The problem with this theory though is one of opportunity and motive. Okay? So, what this means is it's very hard as a foreign government to plan an assassination of an Iranian leader in Iraq. It's very hard. The opportunity isn't there. So maybe Israel, America, want him dead. Well, how could they pull it off? It's very hard to do such a thing. Second problem is motive. What reason would Israel or the United States have for killing the President? Now in the past, the United States and Israel have killed Iranians before. So for example, in January 2020, President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of General Soleimani in Baghdad. But there was a motive here. And the motive is that Soleimani is responsible for Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East, and therefore a direct threat to American interests. And Israel in the past has staged assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in Iraq. But again, the motive is, well, Israel is afraid that Iran develops a nuclear weapon. And therefore, the easiest way to stop that is to kill the scientists, OK? Israel, on April 1 of this year, also staged an airstrike against the Iranian embassy and that's the masses killing two Iranian generals. But again, the motive is, what Israel said was that these generals were working with Hamas to threaten Israel. So the motive is very clear. And the problem here is it's very unclear what the motive is for killing the Iranian president. In fact, there's a lot of risk in that. But again, I am not discounting the possibility. It could be a foreign adversary. And the third possibility is an internal enemy, meaning that there were certain individuals or factions or groups in Iran that wanted the president dead. And so with this internal enemy idea, Opportunity, this problem doesn't exist because obviously these enemies would have resources to track down and kill the president, okay? So an example of this is that remember that when the president was flying home, he had and he had, there were three helicopters, right? It was only his helicopter that crashed. The two other helicopters were fine. Now in theory, and like we don't know who was in the other two helicopters, but we can guess that they were probably military escort, right? They were there to protect the president. But at the same time, if they wanted to kill the president, they could, okay? So was it the military? So the opportunity was there, but then the question is motive. Why would they do that? And the answer is that the possibility, again, we are looking at possibilities, right? Everyone agreed that Abraham Rehzi would most likely become supreme leader of Iran when the current Ayatollah Khamenei died. So Rehzi is 63 and Khomeini is 85. So we can expect that within the next five years Khomeini will die and Rehzi, who many see as Khomeini's protege, will become the Ayatollah. Now the Iranian local system, it's kind of strange because it's an Islamic republic. What that means is that the ultimate authority is God, the Koran. And it's the Ayatollah who represents the God and Koran. So he's the ultimate authority. He has ultimate veto power. And the president is maybe like the CEO of the country. So the person with the real power in the country is the Ayatollah. And if Reishi becomes the Ayatollah, then we can expect major policy shifts in the country. So then the question then is, okay, well, who would benefit from Reishi's death and stopping him from becoming the next Ayatollah? And what people say is, and again guys, I'm working with very limited information. I don't know Iran that well. I just read the news, okay? But what people say is that there are two top contenders to be the next Ayatollah. The first contender, the most likely, is Rehazi. The second contender is actually Khomeini's son, Mostaba Khomeini. So with him gone, most of our Pemene is most likely to be the next Ayatollah. Now this presents a problem for Iran because it's an Islamic Republic. It's supposed to be under the rule of God, right? And one thing that most Iranians oppose is the idea of hereditary leadership, okay, a father passing on leadership to his son. Because remember that in 1979, the Iranians had a revolution to overthrow the king, and everyone was in favor of overflowing the king. So if mostaba Khomeini did become Ayatollah, this would actually create a political legitimacy crisis in Iran. And then the question then is, OK, all right. So mostaba Khomeini benefits. But who would benefit from having him as Ayatollah? And the answer is actually very simple. There's a group in Iran called the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC. We will call them the Revolutionary Guards. And what's interesting about them is that they are separate from the army, the military. So where do these guys come from and why are they separate from the army? Well, it goes back to 1979. Remember in 1979, there was a popular uprising against the Shah of Iran, the king of Iran. And the government brought back, I would call it Khomeini from exile to run the country. And Khomeini at that time was afraid of the army because the army had sworn allegiance to the king. So to deal with this problem, Khomeini established another armed group called the Revolutionary Guard Corps. And what they do is actually very different from the military. The military has an obligation to protect the nation, but the Revolutionary Guard Corps has a responsibility to protect the revolution, the Islamic Republic, okay? Which means ultimately that they are the Khomeini, sorry, they are Khomeini's private army. They only obey him. And the other thing about the revolution is that not only were they trying to bring an Islamic Republic to Iran, but they were trying to export the revolution across the Middle East, okay? So basically the Revolution of Garkor had two main functions. The first main function is to protect the Ayatollah and ensure the revolution succeeds in Iran. But the other function is to export the revolution to the Middle East. Okay? To spread Islamic revolution to Syria, Iraq, back and that's why the Middle East was so disturbed and so angered by the revolution. Alright? Now, this was why the IRGC was founded and because so many countries considered Iran to be a threat, they encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade the country in 1980. And this started something called the Iran-Iraq War. And it was not just the Americans who support this war. The Soviets also support Saddam Hussein and the Middle East countries. Like Saudi Arabia also supported Saddam Hussein. It was a brutal war. And a lot of Iranians died. But ultimately, the Revolutionary Guard Corps was able to protect the revolution from foreign invaders. And because of that, they became the most dominant military group in Iran. And so they almost had unlimited access to funds, okay? not only to protect the revolution in Iran, but also to export it overseas. So does this all make sense to you guys? But with so much power, they eventually became corrupt. Today, people believe that they control about 10% to 50% of the entire Iranian economy. And because you have such a monopoly of power, It meant that over time the economy stagnated. Now Western sanctions, American sanctions, played a major role. It rankling really sell its oil overseas. But the real problem was the fact that you had a monopoly of power, this revolutionary guard corps controlling the entire economy. And this led to protests. So the first protest was in 1999, You got 50,000 students protesting the lack of democracy in Iran. What they were really protesting, of course, was the corruption of the Revolutionary Guard Corp. But you couldn't do that. You can't say that. So they were protesting for democracy. They were crushed. Then in 2009 to 2010, there's something called the Green Movement. And the idea of the Green Movement was that people wanted a new government that promised reform. And in election, their candidate, the reform candidate, lost. And people suspected that the Revolutionary Guard Corps cheated. And so there were violent protests. And again, the Revolutionary Guard suppressed the revolution. And at that point, basically, people lost faith in democracy. And so afterwards, every other president was basically a puppet of the regime. And most of the most recent protests that in 2023, there was a young woman named Masa Ameini. And she was arrested by the police for failing to wear head covering in public. and she died in Qasidi. So people suspect that she was beaten by the police. And this caused massive protests across the country. So for the past 10, 20 years, there have been continuous protests in Iran about the government and the economy, but mainly about the fact that the Revolutionary Guard Corps has monopolized the economy to its own benefit, which has caused the economy to stagnate and for people to become poorer over time. But because the protests are so widespread, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, ironically, has become more powerful because they are seen as the most loyal to the current regime, okay? Their loyalty is not contested. And so what this means is this, What this means is that if there is a change in leadership, if the Ayatollah dies and a new Ayatollah comes in power, what the new Ayatollah will do is reduce the power of the revolutionary guard corps. Does that make sense to you guys? Because he needs to establish his own power base. And the revolutionary guard corps was loyal to the current, the revolutionary guard corps is most loyal to the current leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei. But if there's a new Ayatollah Khamenei of power, he needs to establish his own power base. So he will bring his people into power, and that means reducing the power of the revolutionary guard corps, okay? Does that make sense? And so there will be a direct threat to the refugee guard court. Now, if, but if the current leader's son, Mostaba Kamani, were to become the new Atola, then things would stay the same. And the refugee guard court would continue to control the economy. Okay? Does that make sense to you guys? All right? So again, I'm presenting a reason why the Islamic refugee guard court would want to kill the current president and ensure that the actual son becomes the next leader. Because they wanna maintain the monopoly of power over the country. Doesn't make sense to you guys, all right? Now, I now wanna discuss who these people are and how they think about the world, okay? Because they're corrupt, but they're ultimately religious fanatics that want to export the revolution across the Middle East. Okay? So let's talk about 1979. In 1979, the Shah left Iran because there were so many protests against him. He, the Shah realized that it was very hard for him to stand in power despite the brutality of the army and the police. There's just too many protests, too many people want to see him gone, okay? So he goes to America. And there are many Iranians who are outraged by this for two reasons. The first reason is that they want the Shah, the king of Iran, to stand trial for all his human rights crimes while he was king of Iran, okay? That's the first reason. But the second reason is they were afraid that the Shah had gone to America to win America's support for an invasion of the country. The Shah was trying to get America to invade Iran and put them back in power, which happened in 1933, okay? And so to counter the threat of the Shah, in November of 1979, 300 to 500 students, college students, stormed the US embassy and took it over and held 53 Americans as hostages. Okay, and they demanded the Shah be returned to Iran to stand trial. Now, this is obviously an invasion of American territory. This goes against the national law. But when the students did this, there was so much public support for the students that the authorities didn't really do anything. Also, the Ayatollah Khomeini support the students. Okay, so there was widespread public support for the students. When the students invaded the embassy, the first thing that diplomats must do is basically destroy all the files, right? All the secrets. So, all embassies come with things called shredders. Do you guys know what shredders are? Okay. The letters are just basically machines. And if you want to destroy paperwork, very quickly you put in the machine. And the machine will cut the paper into about 100 different strips of paper, okay? And this is the fastest, most effective way to destroy your documents. And there are about tens of thousands of pages. Can you guess what the students did? Over months, the students slowly and methodically and methodically piece the documents back together one by one. And what these documents revealed to the students and to the public in Iran is that the real center of power in Iran was not the palace where the Shah lived, but the US Embassy. It was the US Embassy that was directing policy in Iran. It was the US Embassy that was responsible for the brutality of the regime. And it was the US Embassy that in 1953 staged a coup d'etat against the democratically elected government of Iran and installed the police state of the shawl. So these students, when they read these documents, were really angry. And you can imagine that these students, because they piece together these documents, right? They're fanatics. And guess what, guys? These students have gone on to become the top military leaders of the country. And I'll just give you three names. Hussain Dagan, who was the Minister of Defense from 2013 to 2017. he was a student protester in the U.S. Embassy. That's one person. Second person is Mohammed Ali Jaffari, who from 2007 to 2019 was head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, okay? And also Mohammed Bagari, who is still the chief of staff of the Iranian Army. So the Revolutionary Guard Corps are staffed by individuals who hate America and see America as the great Satan. And they basically want to go to war with America to avenge the wrongs and evils that America did to Iran. Does that make sense? Second thing I'll mention is that when Sam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980, Iran didn't really have an army. And the reason why is that the revolutionary Garkhor had arrested or exiled or executed the officers of the military, because they were not seen as loyal to the revolution, they were seen as loyal to the Shah. Okay, so Iran didn't have an army. And someone who was saying had airplanes, he had tanks, he had lots of soldiers. And everyone thought that the war would end very quickly. But then what the revolutionary guard corps did was they organized a new army called the Basashi. And this was a volunteer army of poor religious people from the villages. And what the Atletole Komeini said to them is, We don't have weapons, but we have God on our side. Okay? The Iraqis have armor, but we have divine power. And what they did was, um, forward to these villagers, and these guys are about your age, okay? They're 16, 17, 18. And they gave each of these guys a rifle and a key to put over their necks, okay? And the idea is that this key is your entry into heaven. Because when you die in war, you are granted automatic entry into heaven. And so these guys, and they were organized into groups like 22, OK? They would run ahead across Iraqi minefields. Tanks would strike at them, OK? Helicopters would come and strike at them. And they would keep on running. And of course, they would die, okay? Because they didn't have any armor. But the Iraqi spent so much ammunition and bombs on them that eventually the Iraqi army became exhausted. Okay, does that make sense? And so they withdrew. But then Iran took the fight to Iraq. But this shows you that the main power in Iran, why Iran is such a powerful military, is that their relatively guard corps are run by fanatics with a passion for revolution. And they're supported by the Bajazi, who are these poor, illiterate religious volunteers? And there's tens of millions of them for Iran to draw on. Okay? And what the Russia Guard Corps has been doing after the Iraq war is, they recognize that if an enemy comes attacks Iran, people are gonna die. So they want to take the fight to them, okay? And that's why for the past 20, 30 years, the Revolutionary Guard Corps has been supporting conflict in the Middle East. They started something called the Axis of Resistance. So the Axis of Resistance includes Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah in Lebanon, The Huffis in Yemen, Syria, the Assad regime in Syria, as well as Shia militia in Iraq. And so all the money that the Rajatgar Corp makes in Iran is then sent to the axis of resistance to create conflict against Saudi Arabia, United States, and Israel. Does that make sense? But so you can imagine that there are some people and there are actually a lot of people in Iran who are like, why are we doing this again? What, what if we withdrew from the Middle East and just focus on our own economy? Then Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States won't have a reason to attack us. Okay. So there are people who are thinking like, maybe the problem isn't Israel, maybe the problem isn't the United States, maybe the problem is these guys because they're fanatics and they're creating all these problems in the Middle East which is crippling our economy. If we stop these conflicts and just focus on our own economic development then maybe our people will be better off, okay? And one reason to think that there are people in Iran, politicians in Iran who are extremely skeptical of refugee guard policy in the Middle East is that in January 2020, remember that General Soleimani was assassinated by the Americans, right? The Iranian response wasn't that big of a deal. the Iranians basically didn't respond. Whereas the refugee guard corps, because their leader was killed, they demanded vengeance, right? They wanted to go to war. But we can suspect that it was the politicians like Rehzi who basically said, no guys, let's be patient, okay? They went to war against Israel and the United States right now as suicidal. So they were urging, caution and restraint. And the refugee guard corps didn't like that. And then in, and then April 1st of this year, they actually struck the Iranian embassy, right? Which made matters worse. And again, at that time, I'm sure the revolution in the guard court was let's just go to war. And again, I'm sure Rehzi and his team said to them, guys, we cannot be the United States and Israel in a war. Let's be strategic about this. Let's be patient. Our time will come. but we need to be patient. Okay? And I'm sure that because of fanatics, they were like, they are in a way, these politicians are cowards, they're weak, they're soft, they're not believers. Let's get rid of them, okay? And then what happened on May 19th was an opportunity arise where there was fog and they were like, well, here's the opportunity. And so they cause an accident. Okay? Does that make sense guys? All right? So again, I don't know what happened. But if we look at game theory and we examine who would benefit from the death of Rehzi, this group of people, the Red Cross Guard Corp, would most benefit because it is very likely that if Rehzi became the next Supreme Leader, their authority and their policies would be challenged. Okay? And so by getting rid of Rehzi, it makes Mojava Kamani, the son of the Atola, that much more probable in ascending to the Supreme Authority. And that allows them to maintain their power, monopoly of power. And even if this accession costs us a legitimacy crisis, well, it's good for them because then the regime is even more dependent on them. Does that make sense? So during these protests, especially the Green Movement, the Religion Guard Corps was the ones responsible for cracking down, and they were violent and brutal in cracking down. Are you guys clear about the logic here? Any questions? Okay, that's a great question. So Srinagar asks, does the military still exist? And the answer is yes, it still exists. Okay? But again, the refugee guard corp has certain responsibilities that make it the most powerful group. Okay? So the first thing is that it's responsible for the Navy. Okay, why is this important? Because the Strait of Homoos is a very strategic shipping lane. And so they're responsible to maintain that straight. And the Navy allows them also to smuggle, which means that they can make more money for themselves. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that they're also responsible for the missile program, the missile program. And this is where actually the military spends most of its money, the missiles. And the third thing is, of course, foreign policy, meaning that the axis of resistance gets in, sorry, the axis of resistance owner interacts with the rest of the guard corp, okay? So General Salamany and the two generals who died in the Israeli air strike, they all belong to the Islamic Revolution Guard Corp, okay? So these three things mean that the Islamic Revolution Guard Corp, they control basically all the money and all the power in the country. But they're still in military. Does that make sense? All right, any more questions? Okay, so Jack asked a great question. Why is the relationship guard quorbed? Why do they believe that they can control Marsha Taba, Kamani, okay? Okay, so in 1989, the first Ayatollah Komeini died and Ayatollah Komeini succeeded him And the moment he became the new Ayatollah, he focused on cultivating his personal relationship with the Religious Guard Corp. So basically he know, there's about 250,000 of them. And he made a point of meeting everyone and memorizing their names. He even knows the names of their children. So the current Ayatollah Kamenei has a great personal relationship with the Islamic refugee guard court. They're basically his private army. And the reason why that the refugee guard court was transferred loyalty to Mostaba is that Mostaba himself is an extremely unpopular figure. If he were popular, if he were like a clever politician, then he would most likely become next Ayatollah. But because he's very unpopular, There's a lot of resistance to him. So if he becomes next Ayatollah, it would be only because the revolutionary Garpur put him there, which means that he must be loyal and obedient to their policies. Does that make sense, Jacques? Okay, but that's a great question. Any more questions before I move on? Okay, so Selene asks a great question. What changes now that Reyesi is dead? Okay, now, all right. So if it was an accident, then in theory nothing changes, because ultimately it's the Ayatollah Khamenei who is responsible for policy. But if I am correct, and it was a plan assassination by the resident guard corps, then everything changes. What this means is that the political class goes away and the military class takes over and they dictate policy. So you will see, first of all, there's going to be a election. So in late June, there will be someone to replace the president. And it's most likely that the current vice president was Mohammed Markbar, the current vice president, will become the new president. And this is important because Rehzi does not come from the revolutionary guard corps. He comes from the judiciary. That's a different power base. But Mohammed Markbar comes from the revolutionary guard corps. So he would advance revolutionary guard corps interests. And if that's the case, then what we'll see is the country, the leadership, preparing its people for total war. We will see that the rhetoric becomes more extreme and preparing its people for an eventual American invasion. There'll be much more harsh, crackdown on political dissent. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that the resident guard corps cannot defeat America face to face. The only thing that they can do to defeat America and Israel is to lure them into the country. And they do that by provoking them. So there are different things that they can do to provoke America. The first is to accelerate the nuclear program. What America and Israel have said is they see Iran possessing nuclear weapon as an existential threat to the safety of Israel. So this is a no-no. So if Iran accelerates the program, this is a direct provocation. That's the first thing. Second thing is to encourage the proxies. So right now, Israel is very concerned about Hezbollah in the north. Hamas has already attacked them. Hezbollah could also attack Israel. If Hezbollah attacks Israel, then Israel can only interpret this as Iran encouraging Hezbollah to attack them. But if Hezbollah attacks Israel, then Israel and the United States would see this as an escalation. And they would be much more determined to eventually attack Iran in some way. You also have Shia militias in Iraq who could attack US military bases. You also have the Houthis in Yemen who can attack Saudi Arabia, oil fields. So you're encouraging your proxies to make things worse in the Middle East, in which case the United States can only conclude that we need to destroy the head of the snake, which is Iraq. The second thing that could happen. The third thing that can happen is basically Iran starts to attack shipping lanes. It makes shipping much more difficult. And the fourth thing is basically terror. Basically Iran, for its proxy, launches terror attacks against America and its allies. So there are many things that Iran can do to provoke a war. And again, if I'm right, and again, I don't know if I'm right or not, then we should expect that in late June, Mohammed Mark Burr wins the election, and his rhetoric becomes much more extremist. We need to take the fight to America. We need to avenge Salamani. We can also expect that the fighting in the Middle East becomes much more extreme. Okay? And we should see escalation. The acceleration of the nuclear program, proxies become much more violent. Shipping is disturbed and you have a terror campaign throughout the world. Okay? Does that make sense? All right? But again, I don't know. And also, by the way, just because these things might happen does not mean that Ray Z was killed by the revolutionary guard corporate. Do you understand? But I'm saying that if, in fact, the revolutionary guard corporate did kill Ray Z, then we should see these things happening. But just because these things happen does not mean that Ray Z was killed. Does that make sense? All right, any more questions? Okay, so, Selene's question is, how would they fight the war? And they can only fight the war in one way, which is to lure the Americans into attacking Iran. Okay, does that make sense? It is suicide to attack America in the open. Remember that America has shot an aw. Which means that they have air supremacy. Which means they have satellites that can see everything that you do. Which means that special forces, okay? it is suicide to attack America in the open. So what Iran needs to do is trick America into invading Iran and then America would lose for sure. Okay, and that's something that we'll discuss next week, but that's what they have to do. And again, if they provoke America enough, then America will eventually get angry enough to send innovation force against Iran. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Is this clear to you guys? The logic here, okay? So again, this is all speculation. I have no actual information or evidence, okay? I'm just saying, okay, Racy died and it was probably an accident. But it was not an accident, then who would most benefit from killing him or his death? And the answer is the revolutionary garb corps because they see him as a direct threat to their authority, okay? But at the same time, what's important to remember is that any new leader would see these guys as a problem. These have too much power and they are creating too much tension overseas and they're too fanatical. And so it's most likely that they would want to elevate most Habba Kamani because most Habba Kamani is not popular and he would have to be loyal to the revolutionary guard corps, or he would need their help to maintain power. But I, okay, does that make sense guys? All right, so next class we'll discuss what an actual war between the United States and Iran would look like. And what's important to remember is that I've been saying all semester that the United States will lose the war, but never have I said that Iran will win the war. Okay? And the reason why is that this war will be brutal for Iran. Tens of millions of people will die for no reason. And that's why politicians like Raisi and others are like, let's not go to war. Okay? All right. So I'll see you guys next week."}

As you know, last night Trump ordered the bombing of three Iranian nuclear facilities. And this will mark the beginning of World War 3. So I have both good news and bad news. The bad news is we are now approaching the end of the world. The good news is this morning I will tell you how the world will end. So I'm going to look ahead and ask the most pivotal question of this coming war, which is will the United States use ground troops? And as we discussed many times before in previous videos, if the United States were to use ground troops, then they would lose this war, it would mark the end of the American empire and it would probably ignite the second American Civil War. And I think most people would be in agreement that using ground troops would be a disaster for the United States and the United States should avoid using ground forces to the best of its ability. That said, I'm going to use game theory to explain to you why they will still use ground troops against Iran even though it's a really, really bad idea. In fact, it is a catastrophe. Okay, so let's do some game theory analysis. In game theory, we look at the different players. Here be Iran, Israel, the United States. We ask three questions. The first question is, how do they themselves perceive the game? What game are they playing? How do they see themselves? How do they see the roles in this game? That's the first big question. Second big question is, what are their interests? What are their motivations? What are they trying to accomplish? What are their goals? And the third big question then is, given their role and given their interests, what is their optimal strategy in trying to achieve their goals? Okay. So, given these three questions, we're going to look at how Iran, Israel and the United States will play this game in this war. Okay, so Iran is probably easy to do. So, what's our Iran? Iran perceives this war as the opportunity to achieve really important national strategic goals. The first is to create national unity and to further legitimize the authority of the regime. As you know, because of sanctions and because of mismanagement, because of corruption, this regime in Iran is not very popular. But if the Americans are coming to invade and over for the regime and so chaos and destruction, then the people are going to solidly unite behind the the government. I don't know what government it is. Also, the Iranians see this as the best opportunity in a long time to finally destroy the American presence in the Middle East by forcing the Americans into a quagmire that they cannot extrate themselves from. As we've discussed many times, supply issues in Iran will be a huge problem for the American military. They can get in, but it's going to be very hard for them to get out. And the third strategic national interest is to create global legitimacy by defeating the Americans. The Shia regime is trying to be the leaders of the global Muslim movement. And if they were to defeat the Americans in Iran, then they would become the de facto leaders of all Muslims in the world surpassing Saudi Arabia. So those are the three major national strategic interests of Iran. And another question then is, how would Iran force Americans to invade? What is the optimal strategy in this regard? Because remember, the Iranians, they're not going to be able to beat the Americans in a conventional war. They don't have to take technology, they don't have the weapons, they don't have the financing that the Americans do. So they're going to have to trap the Americans in Iran, encircle them and cut off their supply lines and force a negotiated surrender. That's the optimal strategy of the Iranians. So why would the Americans be lured into attacking Iran on Iran's terms? Well, there's a concept in geopolitics in global science called the escalation ladder. The idea of the escalation ladder is that before a full blown war can start, there has to be a certain process of escalation. And in this theory, the Americans have something called escalation dominance, which means that the Americans can always use nuclear weapons if they feel they are losing this war. They are the hegemon, they are the global hegemon and the Iranians are the underdog. So in theory what they teach you in science is that the hegemon has the advantage of escalation dominance. What I want to show you today is actually this theory doesn't really work because escalation dominance, what it does is it forces you into reactions that may be against your best interest. So let me use the metaphor. Let's just say there's a bully in a high school and he's been bullying people for a year now and he's the biggest guy in the school. He's really mean and everyone's afraid of him. He has a reputation for being a thug and that's why he's able to accomplish what he wants to accomplish. Now let's just say that you, you know, have his size. You want to start a fight with him. So, you would think that that would be against your advantage, but one of the events that you have in this fight is you can control the terms of engagement. You can calibrate your actions in order to elicit responses that are to the detriment of the bully. Okay, so what I mean by that is if the bully punches you, well you have options you can choose to go to the principal, you can choose to not do anything, or you can choose to fight back, okay? You have some options. But if you were to punch the bully, the bully would have actually no choice but to punch you back. If he relents, if he compromises, then he loses all credibility in the score. So he has absolutely no choice in the matter, but to punch you back and punch you back harder than you punched him. And what this means is there are ways for you to calibrate your attack so that the bully is trapped. So for example you might say some bad things about him behind his back, then he responds. And anyway the point of the matter is even though the bully is supposed to be the stronger player, He's forced by his reputation to respond in a certain way that you can control and calibrate. Same situation here with Iran versus the United States. The United States is a global hegemon. If Iran were to close off the Sharia hummus, if it were to attack Saudi Arabia, if it were to attack American bases in the Middle East, then the Americans must respond in a way that demonstrates escalation dominance. Okay? And so by slowly and methodically and steadily provoking the Americans in a way that seems fair and reasonable, then Iran can slowly force the Americans into evading Iran. Okay? So it's a gradual process, but the Iranians can do this. Remember, it's the Americans who first launched the first strike against the Iranians. And so the Iranians can now calibrate response in order to slowly trap the Americans in the Middle East. Okay, so from an Iranian's perspective, the optimal strategy is to force Americans to use ground troops to invade Iran. And they can accomplish that by carefully calibrating responses in a way that forces the Americans to respond more harshly until finally the only option really is to use round troops, okay? That's the Iranian case study. Now let's look at the Israelis, okay? The Israelis and the Americans seem to be allies in this war. But the reality is the Americans and the Israelis have divergent interests. America is the global hegemon, therefore it wants to be able to balance forces in the Middle East. Yes, it supports Israel right now, but if Israel were to become too powerful over time, then the Americans would start to back Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, okay? The Americans must maintain lots of power in the Middle East. The Israelis, on the other hand, want to be the dominant hegemon in the Middle East. call the Greater Israel Project that among certain circles in Israel is an extremely influential idea. And the idea is very simple. They believe that in the Bible Yahweh their God gave the Promised Land to Abraham. That's a The promised land though extends from the Nile to the Euphrates. That entire Middle East is supposed to be what Yahweh promised Abraham. And there's a philosophical faction within the Israeli government that seeks to accomplish the promised land. And of course, if that were the case, then the main adversaries to this project would not be the Iranians or the Saudis. or the Saudis, it would actually be the Americans, okay? Because to accomplish the issue, the greater issue of project, the Israel needs to remove America from the Middle East. So how can Israel do this? Well, let's just say, just hypothetically speaking, the Americans were to invade Iran with ground troops and they're stuck there for years and years and they get nowhere. Now the American Empire collapses. The American people revolt against the invasion of Iran. They refuse to serve. They burn their draft cards, as they did in Vietnam. There's civil chaos. There's an emerging civil war in America. And now the American military is forced to retreat from the Middle East. What would happen in that situation? Well, the moment that the American Empire dies, the Empire of Israel is born. Why? Because controlling the Middle East, the American military controlling the Middle East is called central command. They have bases, they have weapons, they have soldiers. If the American nation were to retreat from the Middle East, it does not mean the American military goes away. All it means is the American military will not become absorbed into the nation state of Israel, making Israel the de facto hegemon of the Middle East. Okay, that's the long-term play of Israel. It does Israel absolutely no good to defeat Iran. They need to both defeat Iran and America. Now, best way to do that is to entangle both into a war that will destroy the militaries of of both nations, okay? That's the optimal strategy for Israel. And that requires the Israelis to persuade the Americans to use ground troops to invade Iraq, okay? That's the Israel case study. Now let's look at America. Obviously America does not want to use ground troops because the moment that Americans are dying in the Middle East, the moment that they institute draft it will create chaos in America. People are going to protest, people are going to revolt, politically speaking it will be a quackmire. What the American empire wants to do is use bombing propaganda and financing and this is something we discussed last video to overthrow the Iranian regime, the Alatola, and the Molas, and install a more friendly regime that they can control. And in that way, they can control all the resources, the oil of the Middle East, and they can control global trade as well. And they have to do this as a response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which really put the American Empire on the back foot. So that's the optimal strategy of the American Empire, okay? To overflow the regime with as little casualties as possible, hopefully through bombing, decapitation strikes, killing the Alatola, special forces strategies basically. Okay, but the person leading the American Empire right now is Donald Trump. And if we look at what he wants, it's actually not, it's actually different from what the American Empire wants. Let's ask ourselves a question. What game is Donald Trump playing? Does he really care about Iran? Does he really care about the Middle East? Does he really care about Israel and Zionism and the Great Israel Project? My guess is he does not care. What he cares about is maintaining his political authority and power within the United States. He also cares about destroying the global elite that in his mind robbed him of power in 2022. Remember for Trump the 2020 elections were stolen from him. It's something that that he's been adamant about for the past four years. In fact, he still use over it. So he wants to get back at the global elite who stole the American election from him. And also wants to make sure he stays in power. That means destroying the global elite and the American empire. Okay, so it's really a struggle between America first, represented by Donald Trump, and American empire. Now you would think that this war between the American first people and the American empire would mean that Donald Trump would not use ground troops in Iran. But what better way to destroy the American Empire than to give it what all that it wants, okay? What better way to destroy the American Empire by making it arrogant and by giving it all at once and by putting it in a situation that it cannot possibly win, right? So the idea is this, the idea is at first Donald Trump will seem to want regime change in Iran. And he may even commit ground troops. But as the American people start protesting, as there's violence and civil strike within America, as American soldiers start to die in Iran, as the global economy collapses, then Donald Trump's going to want to change his mind, right? But the American Empire is fully committed to winning this war. It wants, it's all in. It refuses to surrender. And now a conflict emerges between the American Empire and America first. And Donald Trump can now aggravate this tension by standing with America first over the American Empire. And this would lead to a civil war. And you think, you think this is a bad thing, But the civil war and an unknowable war in the Middle East are going to greatly enhance the power and authority of Donald Trump. So much so that he would probably be able to capture a third term. Okay? So it's really interesting in that all three major players, Donald Trump, Israel and Iran, want America to use ground troops in Iran for their own selfish, individualistic purposes. And that's why I think ground troops will eventually be used in Iran. And I think what will happen is that basically all three players, Iran, Israel, and Donald Trump will get exactly what they want. Israel will be able to remove America from the Middle East and become the empire of Israel. Iran will unite the Muslim world behind its leadership. And Donald Trump will probably get his third term. Okay, that's what I see the upshot of this war being. Now this raises a lot of questions though, right? I mean, if Israel becomes greater Israel and it becomes the empire of Israel and dominates the Middle East controlling oil and trade, then wouldn't the world unite against Israel? And unfortunately, that's part of the plan. That's part of the prophecy. Okay, and this is something that we will discuss in the next video, because using game theory itself, It's not enough to fully explain and understand what's going on in the Middle East. To fully understand what's going on, in my next video, I'm gonna explain to you the religious ideals, the religious obsessions, driving this war in the Middle East. I'm gonna explain to you the idea of eschatology, which means the understanding of how the world ends. Basically, all the major players in the game, Iran, Israel, even to a certain extent to the United States, the Christian Zionists from the United States, see this war in Iran as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. They really see this as the end of the world. And that's why this war is so scary for all of us. And so in my next video, I will reveal to you the religious dimensions of this war. Okay. Some other points before I conclude this video. Some of you have reached out in my last video and said that I should not reveal my public information. I shouldn't put my family in front of the camera. And you're absolutely right. Upon reflection, I want to thank everyone who voiced their concerns. Honestly, this is all new to me. I was a high school teacher, teaching my students, and now I'm internet famous. And everyone's looking to me for some guidance as to this US Iran war. And I'm flattered, but I'm also overwhelmed by the attention. I'm an educator. I want to continue to educate people on how this war is going to unfold so that you will be better prepared. I see that as my mission. And so I'm going to continue making videos. I'm going to continue as this war progresses, explaining to you using game theory how this war might unfold. But I now understand that any that can be a scary, crazy, insane place. So I have to be much more careful about my public profile and I have to be a lot more careful about protecting my family. Okay, so I'm gonna keep on making videos, but I apologize if you reach out and I don't really answer you. I'm being overwhelmed right now. I apologize if you reach out and you wanna have coffee and I can't do it. Again, my focus right now is on studying this war, trying to figure out what's going on and to the best of my ability to explain and clarify what's going on, okay? So I will see everyone next time. Goodbye."}

Remember the story so far? We talked about the Bronze Age and where Massey and Grease was trading and fighting with the rest of the world. And then the Bronze Age collapse happened and Massey and Grease came to an end. And because of its destruction, This allowed for massive innovation throughout Greece. So we saw the introduction of the polis, the city state. We saw the beginning of the use of the alphabet. And so literacy rates increased radically throughout Greece. And we saw Homer, who gave us the Iliad and the Odyssey. So today I'm just going to go over the overview of Greek history, mainly focusing on the polis. Okay? So one thing to understand about the polis is that geography is destiny. Okay? Geography is destiny. And this basically means that your geography will determine the culture, the economy, and the political structure of your society. And we see that with the Greek polis. The Greek geography is very diverse. There are mountains, there are rivers, there are plains, and there are coastlines, okay? And depending on where you are, geographically in Greece, you will have a different type of polis. And so the two classic examples are sparta and Athens. Sparta and Athens are the two most dominant polis in about the year 500 BC, okay? So let's first talk about sparta. So sparta is located on the Pelinese, This is Sparta. And the land around Sparta, it's basically plains, which makes it ideal for agriculture. So for most of its history, Sparta was an agricultural nation. And because it is ideal for agriculture, it needs people to work the land. And through its conquest, Sparta developed a slave system. And these people are called helots. And helots are just slaves in Sparta that work the land. They're farmers, and these are people who have been conquered by Sparta. And because there are so many helots, the ratio is about 10 to one. So for every one helot, sorry, for every one Spartan, there's 10 helots. Sparta had to become a military society in order to control the helots. So it created an education system in order to train its citizens to be soldiers. So the system worked like this. About eight, seven, about eight, seven, you left your family and you were put into a boarding school where you watched over by kids who were older than you, okay, maybe 11 or 12. And obviously if you put young kids with older kids, the older kids will beat the crap out of these young kids who are about seven or eight. And this instills the idea of emotional discipline into the children. Now when these children became teenagers, they were paired with a mentor who was maybe 25 to about 30, okay, an older adult, And they became lovers. The Sparins did not consider this homosexuality. We would consider it homosexuality. But they themselves did not consider this homosexuality. They just considered this as a way to build emotional cohesion, love among its soldiers. And about age 18 or 19, the students would graduate. and they would go on to marry and have their own families. But the Spartan soldiers were all required to eat together, okay? So the soldiers, even though they had families, they were still required to train together and to eat together. Spartan had no private property. Everything, including the helots, belonged to everyone, okay? So it's basically communism or proto-communism. They had no money system, they had no wealth. Everything belonged to everyone. And it was a brutal state, okay? The Spartans were notorious for being brutal people. So an example is the hellots. So they had a campaign of terror to maintain control over the hellots. So young soldiers would often be required to patrol at night. Okay, they would maybe lie in the fields because now and then some hellots would break curfew. They would at midnight try to sneak out and have some fun. And if you, as a Spartan young man, saw a hellot be out at night, well, they would kill you. They would take it at night and stab you in the neck. And this was meant to instill terror in the hellots. to prevent them from rebellion. But the problem is, because there are so many hellots, and the Spartans were so brutal, rebellions and revolutions would break out often. So this greatest society, which focused on maintaining control in the Pelinese. So the Spartans were not at all interested in foreign policy. They had absolutely no interest in the world outside Sparta. The Spartans, as a culture, was very conservative. They liked the way that they liked the way they wanted things to stay the way they are. So it was a very conformist culture. Now and then you had some kings or individuals who tried to change society. the Spartans would kill those people, okay? You were not allowed to question authority. You were not allowed to promote change in Sparta. The Spartans were also isolationists, okay? Their entire policy was, if you leave us alone, we'll leave you alone. And so that was the society of Sparta. When you think about it, in many ways, it's very much like China throughout its history, okay? So the analogy is China, which China has always been, brought to its history, very conservative and very isolationist. China is just not interested in the outside world. Why? Because it's focused on maintaining control over its peasantry, OK? There's too much internal chaos. China just is not interested in the outside world. So China, for its history, has both been conservative. does not like change, okay? And very isolationist. Is that concern about the outside world? Does that make sense, guys? Any questions so far about Sparta before I move on to Athens? Okay, so Athens was a completely opposite society to Sparta. And the reason why, again, is geography. This is Sparta. Sorry, this is Athens. And Athens is in Attica. And it's by the coast. And Athens, the countryside, is very hilly. So it's bad for growing crops. But Athens has two major advantages. The first major advantage is it has a very good harbor. And also, it's hilly, but the hilly terrain is actually good for growing olive trees, olives. It's also very good at pottery. So because of this, Athens, for most of its history, focus on trade. It was a trading nation. And because they are traders and merchants, they have a very different culture to the Spartans. So the first thing is they're very expansionist. They're aggressive. And the idea here is the Athens will go and seek out new markets. They also plant new colonies throughout the Aegean. To the west is the Aegean Sea. this south is the Mediterranean, okay? And they will plant colonies throughout this area. And they have to encourage their citizens to go out and explore the world in order to find new markets in order to bring goods and ideas back to Athens. Okay? Because Athens was expansionist, its cultural system, its cultural beliefs was very different from the Spartans, okay? So whereas the Spartans were very conservative, the Athenians had a policy, had a belief in the idea of eudaimonia, eudaimonia. So eudaimonia is a Greek word and it means human flourishing, flourishing. And the idea here is to be the best that you can be, all right? So the example of Eudaimonia, the most famous example of Eudaimonia is this. In Homer's Iliad, the main character is Achilles. Achilles is the best warrior of the Greeks against Troy. And Achilles says this in the book. He says, before I came to Troy, I saw a prophet. I saw a fortune teller and he told me my fortune. He said I could choose to not come to Troy and live to be a, live a very long, healthy life. But I'd be a nobody. If I came to Troy, I would die young, but I would die as a hero. I would be remembered by everyone, everyone would sing of my glory and my triumph. So that was my choice. I could live for a long time and just be a nobody, or I could be a hero and die young. And he said, well for me, that's not a choice. For me to be alive means to achieve new pneumonia. I have to be the best that I can be, and therefore my only option is to come to Troy and die a hero. And that's the mentality in Athens. It is much better to die young as a hero than to live a long time as a nobody. Whereas in Spartans, we're the complete opposite, okay? It's just better to be a nobody and get along with everyone than it is to die as a hero. So very opposite societies. And what this did, this idea of eudaimonia, it made Athens into a very competitive society. Okay, because if everyone's trying to achieve eudaimonia, then you're gonna have a lot of competition, okay? Because they're gonna be one hero. Everyone cannot be a hero, they're gonna be one hero. So again, the example is Homer's Iliad, and when Achilles got into a fight with Agamemnon, Okay, Achilles basically says, I don't like you, you're a dog, I'm not gonna fight for you. And Egemanon says, I don't need you. What Achilles did was, he went to his mother, who was a goddess, and Achilles said to Thetis, his mother, could you please get the gods to help the Trojans, so that Egemanon would have to come beg for my help against the Trojans. He was basically committing treason. And in the Greek world, you're allowed to do that because the most important thing is eudaimonia, to achieve eudaimonia. Okay, does that make sense? It's a very weird world, but in Athens, it's extremely competitive where everyone's trying to backstab each other in order to become the hero. And because of this, there's so much competition, Athens created a new system called ostracized. So the idea here is because the Athenians were so at each other's throat, if someone was breaking the rules or if someone was being too competitive in the pursuit of Eurymonia, the Athenian people could choose to ostracize this person. And what this meant was you'd be banished, banished or exiled from Athens for 10 years. And this was considered even worse than death. Okay, this punishment was worse than death. The reason why is in the Polish system, the only people that mattered were citizens. Okay? And the Greek world was very chauvinistic or close, which meant that you could not be, you could not earn the right to be a citizen. You have to be born to become a citizen. You understand? You have to be born into citizenship. You cannot become a citizen through your own hard work and through your merit, okay? Does that make sense? So in other words, if you were banished from your Polish, you became a nobody. You were basically dead to everyone. These only citizens had rights in the Greek world. If you were a slave or you were a foreigner, you had absolutely no right. You cannot own land. You could not even speak in public, okay? Does that make sense? All right. So Athens was a democracy where everyone had the right to speak and to vote. But really, when we talk about democracy in this world, we're not saying that everyone could become president or everyone could become a leader. Really, political power can only be held by people of nobility. So democracy usually was a battle between different factions of the nobility, usually between the upper nobility and the lower nobility. And this is a lesson that's true throughout history. So remember, usually we think history, society, the conflict is between the halves and the half-knots, the poor and the rich. half versus half nots. What I would teach you in this class, one important thing I would teach you in this class is this is not true, okay? In the illiterate history, the conflicts in society are usually between the half a lot and half some what more. Does that make sense, okay? It's usually between the half a lot versus the half some what I want more, okay? And throughout history, we call these people different names. So in this society, these are basically the lower nobility. These are the nobility who have money, but they want more. And in the French Revolution, we'll call them the petite bourgeoisie. And today we call them the middle class. Does that make sense? The poor people do not rebel. They might riot, but they do not revolt. It's usually the middle class or the low nobility or the petite bourgeoisie that revolt. Does that make sense? All right, so, out there is a democracy and it's usually a conflict between the upper nobility and the low nobility. Sparta is an olararchy, okay? Which is basically means rule by the few and they hate democracy. So these systems, these cultures, Spartan and Athens, are diametrically opposed to each other. They hate each other, they're always in conflict with each other. Does that make sense? Any questions so far about Spartan and Athens? Are you guys clear about this? These two different cultures. All right, so this is about the year 500 BCE. Around this time, the Greeks are colonizing the Mediterranean and the Aegean, okay? And this territory belongs to Persia. The Persian Empire is considered one of the greatest empires ever in human history. We will do the Persian Empire later this semester, okay? But I wanna focus on the Greeks for now. All you need to know is the Persian Empire spread throughout most of the world, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, And we're called Iran today, okay? It was a huge, huge empire that was extremely enlightened for its age, okay? It was really considered the best empire at that time. And there were Greeks who lived in Anatolia or what they call Asia Minor back then. The thing about the Persian Empire is if you were a subject city, you could do whatever you want, but you have to pay taxes. And these people did not like to pay taxes. So they revolted. And they revolted, they went to Sparta and Athens and sought help. Okay, they basically said, look, we're all Greeks. We're being oppressed by the Persians. Could you please help us? What does the Spartan say? What was the Spartan's response? No, because we don't care, okay? Your problem, not my problem. Well, and what did Athenians say? Yeah, sure. Let's achieve eudaimonia, man. Let's be Achilles. Let's go over and help them and maybe make a lot of money for ourselves. Okay. So because the Persian Empire was so powerful, they destroyed the rebellion. Okay. And in 490 BCE, the Persians decided to attack Greece to teach the Athenians a lesson. And this was called the Battle of Marathon. And in the Battle of Marathon, we actually don't know that much about it, okay? The sourcing is very limited, but what they say, okay, is in the Battle of Marathon, there are about 10,000 Athenians versus 25,000 Persians. That's a huge advantage for the Persians, right? Well, the Athenians destroyed the Persians, okay? The Athenians lost about 192 men. The Persians lost about 5,000. It was a slaughter. And a lot of the reason why is in military tactics. So the Persian Empire is huge. OK? Lots of flat land. And in this geography, your main advantage is cavalry, right? Horse archers. That's what the Persians were known for. Men on horses who would ride around and shoot arrows at you. OK? The geography of Greece was different. It was hilly, so you didn't really use cavalry. It was mainly infantry fighting against each other. And what the Greeks did over 100 years was develop a new military tactic called hoplites. Hoplites. So hoplite that comes from the word hoplain, hoplain is Greek for shield. So these are men with large shields and spears, okay? The way they fought was using the phalanx formation, phalanx. And the innovation of fact innovation was, it was basically a wall, okay? So men would stand together and behind each other so that they made a wall. And because they shield and spears, it was a moving wall. And the person didn't have armor. So when men of armor went to battle with men without armor, usually armor wins, okay? So the Greeks, the Athenians, destroyed the Persians at the Battle of Marathon. That made the Persians even more angry, OK? So in about 480 BCE, Persia organized a massive invasion force against Greece. And this massive invasion force, again, The numbers, the data, we can't conform it, but we think it's about half a million people, half a million soldiers. That's huge, okay? But not only that, you had a huge navy. And basically, Persia called on every nation of its empire to fight against Greece, which included Egypt, okay? Which included the Phoenicians, which also included Greeks who lived in a territory of Persia, okay, and these Greeks are called the Ionian Greeks, okay? So it's a massive invasion force. And Sparta and Athens became allies to resist the Persian invasion. But there were also some Greek polices that sided with the Persians, including Thebes, okay? The Macedonians to the north was also studying with the Persians. So the invasion came north from Macedonia down here. And you may have heard of the Battle of Thermopylae, okay, the Thermopylae. This was made famous by a movie called 300. I'm not sure if you've seen the movie 300, okay? But basically it was about 300 Spartans, about 5,000 other Greeks, who tried to make a stand against the Persian invasion and they got destroyed. Okay, so the Spartan, So the Persians came in and the Greeks decided, okay, you know what, their numbers are so much bigger than ours, let's retreat, okay? Back to Sparta. And here at Corriath, they decided to build a wall to stop the Persian advance. The problem though is Athens is here, okay? So the Persians came in and burned down Athens. Now, what's important to understand is the Greeks have the cause of a polis. It's not a place, it's a community. A polis is wherever the Greeks choose to be. So what happened that's very interesting is even though the Athens came to destroy, sorry, even though Persia came to destroy Athens, the Athenians just got into their ships, they just boarded their ships because Athens is a naval power and they just sailed away. Okay, do you understand? So Athens was at the stride, the city of Athens was destroyed, but not the community, the polis of Athens. And so, but now the Greeks are in a lot of trouble, okay? Because what the Persians can now do is basically take their ships and sail around and attack Sparta from behind. And there's a huge problem for Sparta because why? What is Sparta's ultimate weakness? Why is it so easy to defeat Sparta in a war? What's the problem? Do you guys remember? What are the Spartans really afraid of? The hellots, right? Okay, the hellots. Remember, there's 10 hellots where everyone's Spartan and the hellots hate the Spartans because the Spartans are terrorizing, have terrorized them for centuries. So all that Persia has to do now, okay? Very easy is take their ships, land and sparta and build forts, defenses, and the Hellots would run into them. Then the King Xerxes of Persia says, I, the benefit of the King of Persia, declare the Hellots to be free people now. Now you have a revolution, okay? The Hellots are now armed by the Persians. And guess what? The Hellots are gonna kill the Spartans. Game over, okay? You understand? The war is over. That's all the Persians have to do. Take their ships, sail around to the coast of Sparta, build forts and defenses so that the Hallots can run to them, give the Hallots weapons, and then let the Hallots run loose against the Spartans, and the war is over. Greece is forever destroyed. Okay? You understand? Very simple, right? The Persians did not do that. Okay? The Persian king Xerxes had a war council. And there were a lot of general generals who said to King Xerxes, king, we've won the war. We're all over Greece. We have half a million men in Greece. There's nothing the Greeks can do about this. So the Persian were feeling very confident. And the Greek Navy was on an island called Salamis. And everyone was freaking out. And what the Spartans wanted to do was say, let's take our navy and defend the coastline of Sparta, because we know the Spartans are gonna invade Sparta at some point. They're gonna land their ships on Sparta. Let's take our navy and defend Sparta. There was one Athenian general, okay? His name is Femmeciclis. And he said, you know what, that's great for you guys, Okay, but remember our city Athens has been destroyed. We need to take on the Persians head on. We can't wait. And the Spartans are like, yeah, that's fine, but they outnumber us three to one. They have three more ships, they have three ships for every one ship we have. There's no way we can beat them in a naval battle. And the Feminescans he says, we either fight the Persians now and achieve Eurymonia or we Athens, where we like screw you Spartans, we're gonna go take our ship and sail off West to Sicily or Africa, who cares, okay? But we're gonna go away and we're gonna leave the Persians to kill you guys, okay? So, spontaneously, we're gonna have a choice but to listen to Athenians and fight. Then what Thameskinesis did was he sent a spy to King Xerxes and King Xerxes was having this war council about what to do and most of his generals were like, my great king, we've won the war. Let's just take our ships and attack Spartan and the war is over, okay? Then a spy, said by Famiscopys, says to King Xerxes, oh, great king, the entire Greek navy is stuck in Salamis, but they want to run away. Now's your chance to attack them and destroy the Greek navy once and for all, okay? And at this point, King Xerxes made the decision to send his entire navy, okay? To destroy the great navy at Salamis. And the generals were like, don't do that man, that's a risk you don't have to take. Why do that? Why take the Greeks on, why fight the Greeks head on when we can just starve them out? And King Sturgeon said, no, I came to defeat the Greeks. I'm the great king, I want to defeat the Salamis and build a monument to celebrate my great victory over the Greeks. My father, King Darius, set an army in 490 BC and the Athenians killed or destroyed his army at Marathon. I'm going to prove I'm a greater king than my father by defeating the Greeks at Salamis. I don't want this war of attrition, this slow war. I want one great battle so that history will be memory forever. So he sends his entire force, about a thousand ships, to Salamis. And Salamis, it's a straight, okay? It's very narrow. So the ships have to line up and attack the Greeks one by one, okay? And at Salamis, in the headlong battle, okay? The Greek ships were heavier, and the Greek ships were manned by hoplites with armor. And in this battle of Salamis, the Greeks destroyed the Persian Navy, okay? Do you understand? The Persian army had won the war. And as Salamis, they lost the war. Okay? Now the problem is, now that the Persian Navy has been destroyed, supply lines are in trouble. Okay? You understand? Because Greece is very poor. Greece is a very poor nation. You cannot resupply yourself in Greece. How do you feel, have you met people? Well, you need to bring in supplies from Persia. but now your navy has been destroyed. So now King Xerxes freaks out and he goes home. He's like, you know what, I burned down Athens, that's good enough for me, okay? And he leaves his cousin, General Mardanis, to fight the Greeks, okay? And at this point Mardanis could have chosen to not fight the Greeks, right? Because Athens has been destroyed and Sparta is still under threat. So all Mardones had to do was, he was in thieves, okay? He was in thieves. All he had to do was stay in thieves and wait out the war, okay? This is what we call a war of attrition, where you wait out the other enemy, because the other enemy has basically less resources than you. Okay, does that make sense? Again, really easy for the forces to win, but Mardones chose to fight the Greeks at the Battle of Palatia. And here, it was about equal forces, 100,000 Greeks versus 100,000 Persians, and the Greeks destroyed the Persians. The Persians lost five times more men than the Greeks. And General Mardona was killed in this battle. So this war that the Persians should have won very easily the persons lost and were completely destroyed. Doesn't make sense. Any questions so far about the Persian invasion? And because of this war, Greece now became extremely wealthy. The reason why is, Persia is forced to retreat from Asia Minor and the Greeks were able to capture a lot of treasure. Okay, now after this Persia switches strategies. Persia never again invades Greece because they think this is stupid to invade Greece. But the Greeks don't know this. The Greeks think, okay, the Persians will come back at any point. So the Athenians say, let's take the battle to Persia. And what do the Spartans say? The Spartans say, no, we're gonna go home And that's it, okay? So to battle against the Persians, the Athenian civilization called the Dalian League. The Dalian League is a defensive alliance between Athens and these colonies and islands in the Aegean. And the idea is, if the Persians come back, we will master forces and fight the Persians at sea. The problem is that only Athens had a navy. Everyone else didn't really have a navy. So everyone else is like, we don't have a navy, but what could you make money? And they agreed that this money, this treasury, could only be used against Persia if Persia invades. So they put all this money on a place called Delos. And the island called Delos. That's why it's called the Dalian League. Doesn't make sense. So basically, Athens would put up a navy, and everyone else would put up money. And this money, the Treasury of the Daily League, can only be used in a war against Persia. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay. So while this is happening, Athens is the rising power in this world. And in 461 BCE, a new political leader called Pericles comes into power. And as you should know from your research, Pericles is considered the father of Athenian democracy. He's the one who spreads democracy throughout Athens. And historians today worship Pericles. Pericles is considered one of the greatest leaders ever in Western history. I'll talk more about Pericles and democracy in future classes. But I want to show you that Pericles was first and foremost a politician who was concerned about amassing and keeping power, does that make sense? So he did a lot of wonderful things for Athens, but I want to show you these things that he did, even though they seem great, they really were about him amassing power for himself. Okay? So the first thing he did was he spread democracy to everyone. OK? He basically gave every citizen the right to vote. And you're like, OK, that's great. Directive democracy. Athens creates democracy. This is great, right? But the reason why he did that was to change the balance of power in Athens. So he basically represented the lower nobility versus the upper nobility, right? Usually, the upper nobility has more power because it has more money. It has more prestige. So the way for the lower nobility to defeat the nobility is by aligning itself with the people. Doesn't make sense. You do that by giving people the right to vote. And so by doing this, Pericles basically made himself king of Athens. Doesn't make sense. In fact, he stayed in power from 461 to 429. Okay, doesn't make sense. All right? And to please the people even more, he basically made corruption official. What he did that was very important was, he basically took the money from Delos and brought it to Athens. Basically, he practically said to the Delin League, you know what, there's money in Delos, it's a lot of money. I'm afraid that the person's coming to steal it. So let's take it to Athens. When he brought to Athens, the next thing he did was, he spent all of it. He built a lot of really impressive buildings, including something called the Parthenon. The Parthenon is this great temple to Athena, which is a patron goddess of Athens. They made the Athenian statue out of gold. They spent billions and billions of dollars on this temple. The reason why is when you do that, right? You give people jobs and you give people who support you money, okay? So this is basically official corruption. Now, there are people in the upper nobility who fought what Pericles was doing was terrible for Athens. And basically in meetings, they wanted to ostracize Pericles, right? They accused Pericles of corruption, of basically bribing the city of Athens, and they said, you are corrupting our morals. You are hurting our democracy. Therefore, we want to ostracize you. And there was this vote against Pericles. And what happens? You guys know? The people voted to exile Pericles' opponents. Those who criticized Pericles were now exiled from Athens. Therefore, Pericles no longer has any political opponents. And Pericles can do whatever he wants. And so the two big innovations of Pericles is democracy. OK? Let's give people the right to vote, and let's give people more money. OK? But also empire. The reason why is after Pericles basically stole the money from the Dealing League, the allies were obviously angry. Right? You stole our money. So we are out of this league and Pericles said, well, if you leave our league, we're gonna come in and invade you. So Athens started this expansionist campaign in order to maintain its empire. So the dealing league basically became the Athenian empire. And now Athens got basically 20% of its revenue from its allies, okay? Doesn't make sense. So that's what Pericles was doing. He was promoting democracy in order to make sure people voted for him. He was promoting empire in order to maintain the easy money flow into Athens. Empire is important because, remember, Athens has a culture of eudaimonia. So empire makes the rich extremely wealthy. You understand? Empire makes everyone rich, but it makes it a wealthy, even more so. And so the lower nobility, okay, the lower nobility became very jealous. And so the way that we resolved this issue is the lower nobility could choose to invade other places, okay? And if they win, they could make a lot of money for themselves. So one place they chose to invade was Egypt, but that failed, okay? So throughout this time you had a lot of Athenian expeditions throughout the world in looking to conquer new territory, and sometimes they succeeded, but a lot of times they failed as well, because that makes sense. All right, so as Athens is expanding and becoming much wealthier, other Greek colonies, other Greek policies start to get angry at Athens. Athens is basically the big bully. They were afraid of Persia before, but Persia didn't really bother the Greeks, whereas Athens was a big bully. They wanted to control all of Greece. They basically were a mafia organization that was forcing these islands in the agency to pay tribute to Athens. They were trying to take more territory from other Greek policies. So in 431, the Greek policies united around Sparta, and so it's something called the Peloponnesian War. And historically, what most historians will tell you is this war was started because Sparta was afraid of an emerging Athens. Okay? Sparta was the hegemon. Sparta was the most dominant power in Greece at that time. Now that Athens was rising, Sparta felt threatened by Athens and therefore declared war on Athens. That's not true. Okay? That's not the reason. The reason why is because Athens was an empire and it was going around and bullying everyone. And so you didn't have a choice in the matter. You got to fight Athens now or wait for Athens to invade you. So it was because Athens was a imperial power. And so other nations had to, other group was had no choice but to stand against Athens. And Athens was an imperial power because of its theory of unimonia. So the great irony here, and you will see this pattern repeat itself throughout history, is the thing, the culture that allows a nation to rise, unless you're unimonia, will also cause it to decline. Doesn't make sense. Because it's because of the Pelican War, which class from about 431 BC to 404 BCE, 27 years, that Athens loses its empire. So the culture, eudaimonia, that causes Athens to rise will ultimately lead to its decline as well. So are you guys clear so far? Please let me know if this is clear to you, if you have any questions before I continue. So even though Sparta and Athens are now at war with each other, this war again should have been pretty easy won by Athens. Why? What can Athens do to destroy Sparta? You guys know? What can Athens do? Really easy to destroy Sparta. Hellots, right? The Athenians have ships. They can choose to do what the Persians should have done but they didn't do. Which is to basically take its navy, land its navy on the coast and support the hell-ots in the rebellion, okay? If that would have happened, Sparta would have been destroyed very quickly. They think it's in do that, right? Do you understand? They think it's in do that. Now, Sparta, to counter this threat against Athens, what should it have done to counter this threat against from Athens? Exactly, thank you, okay? Its only option in this scenario is to free the hell-ots and save the Helots, if you fight for us against Athenians, we will give you your liberty, okay? And the Helots would have been, yeah, let's go fight for the Spartans, okay? So Sparta would have increased its army 10 times and it could have destroyed Athens. Sparta didn't do this either, okay? Do you understand? So from a military strategy perspective, the way the Pope-Polysian War didn't make any sense. The only way to understand what happened is to understand that the very basis of conflict in society is between the upper nobility and the lower nobility. You understand? The upper nobility is only interested in maintaining the status quo. They're very conservative. They don't like wars because you could lose wars and also because you win wars, you have people who are now richer than you are. You understand? So the upper nobility is very conservative in both Athens and Sparta. Lower nobility can only become upper nobility through war or revolution, okay? So they're always looking to upset the status quo. So even though this war is going on, internally, there's still conflict between the upper nobility and the lower nobility, okay? And that's why, if you look at the palace between a war, a lot of military strategy doesn't make any sense because Sparta isn't really trying to win a war against Athens, Sparta is trying to maintain the status quo in Sparta. Athens is not really trying to win a war against Sparta. Athens is trying to maintain the status quo within Athens. An example is Pericles, the war starts in 431 BC. And a lot of people are saying Pericles, hey, let's go invade Sparta. And what Pericles says instead is, oh no, no, no. The Sparans are the greatest warriors in the world. We have no chance against Sparta. So what we'll do is we have these walls, okay? We have these walls, we'll hide behind our walls and let our navy protect us in the sea, okay? That was the defensive strategy of Pericles. And so what the Spartans could do was they could come to Attica and destroy all the farmland. And the Athenians could only watch as the Spartans destroy the farmland. This was a disaster for the Athenians because if you think about it, over time, the Spartans could starve out the Athenians. The other problem is you have too many people in one place, what happens? You have too many people living in a city, what happens usually? Disease, right? Disease. So because of the population in Athens, they had to play, which killed one third of the Athenian population. Okay, do you understand? One third of the Athenian population. If the Athenians went to war against Sparta and they lost, they would have at most lost about 10% of their population. But because they chose not to fight and hide behind the walls, not only did they lose their farmland, but they lost a third of their population. including Pericles who died because of the plague. Pericles died as well as his two sons. Doesn't make sense. So again, this strategy makes no sense. If you think from a military perspective, it only makes sense if you understand there's an internal conflict in Athens between the upper nobility and the lower nobility. Pericles represents the upper nobility. He wants to maintain a status quo. There's a war going on, but he doesn't really want to fight this war. He just wants to wait it out because he does not want to change the status quo. It doesn't make sense. So after Pericles dies, the low nobility become ascended. And because of this war, they propose an aggressive strategy against the Spartans. Basically, it's like, let's go attack the Spartans and cause a revolution in Sparta. And this was proposed by Cleon, who after Pericles died became basically the de facto leader of Athens. And he was considered a demagogue. If you look at the history, everyone says bad things about this guy. But really, what he is, he's low in ability who's trying to achieve eudaimonia. And he's basically like, from Mexico, please. All right? And he's a great military strategist as well. So, Cleon proposes this aggressive strategy against Sparta and guess what happens? Athens is now destroying Sparta. Okay? Now Sparta is under a lot of pressure. It's losing the war. So now what Sparta does is, it picks a new general, Brassidis, and says to Brassidis, listen, we're losing a war. What can we do? So Brassidis goes north and he starts to win these victories against Athens. And his policy is this, listen, we need to change our social structure in order to win against Athens. So what he does is he tells the hellots, if you fight for me, I'm going to give you your freedom. And so a lot of hellots fight for Brassidis. And Brassidis wins a lot of wars. And this is, and how does Spartans feel about this? Brassists who are Spartan is now winning wars against Athens. And so how do the Spartans feel about this? Are they happy about this? No, they're really unhappy about this, okay? Because it's changing their social structure. You understand? They don't want this crap. They want the hell out to be slaves. They don't want the hell out to be free citizens who helps them win wars, okay? So what ultimately happens is even though Cleon and Brassidys have both proposed strategies that allow Athens and Sparta to win the war. Ultimately, what happens is, Cleon and Brassidys get into a battle with each other and they both die in this battle. That's extremely convenient, guys, okay? That's really, really convenient. So I'd be very surprised if they actually did both die in battle. My guess is what happened is, they were both assassinated during the battle against each other. Does that make sense? because ultimately both were the bigger threats to the social structure of Sparta and Athens than losing the war itself. Doesn't make sense guys, okay? Any questions so far? Okay, doesn't make sense. Okay, okay, so now, so this war keeps on going and then what happens is the Persia gets involved and gives Sparta a navy. basically Persia gives Sparta a blank check. And because Sparta is so conservative and insular, it doesn't really know how to have a navy, okay? It doesn't know how to fight with a navy. In fact, Sparta is militarily, like in terms of strategy, it's actually very weak, okay? If it's like, Sparta and soldiers by themselves are very strong, but in terms of like overall military strategy, Sparta, because it's so conservative and insular, it's very weak again, it's very weak compared with Athens. But Persia has a lot of money and Persia is back rolling Sparta, okay? And eventually Persia says to Sparta, hey guys, what are you trying to do with strategy? The strategy is this. If a general is winning against the Athenians, promote the guy, okay? And you're like, okay, well that makes total sense. The Spartans didn't do that, okay? The Spartans were not concerned about winning the war, they were concerned about maintaining their social order. You understand? There's a social hierarchy in Sparta. That's what's important, not winning the war. And then there was a Sparta commander, Lysander. And he was really the only Sparta who knew how to win naval battles. The problem with Lysander was he was a half citizen, which meant that his father was a Sparta, but not the mother. You understand? Only if both your parents are citizens are you allowed to be a citizen. So Lysander was really looked down upon in Sparta. But he could win naval battles. So he was unpromoted. The person said to the Spartan, listen, this is stupid, okay, Lysander is a great commander, you have to promote him. The Spartans didn't even have a choice in the matter. And so Lysander, after he was promoted, singlehandedly won the war against Athens. He laid siege to Athens in 404 BCE, and then Athens had no choice but to surrender because they were out of food, okay? Does that make sense? Now, for 27 years, Sparta and Athens were at war with each other, they were killing each other. Now Athens has finally been defeated. So what do you think should happen now? What should happen to Athens now? Okay, the answer is nothing happened to Athens. Usually if you lose a war, in this world, what happens is they come and kill all the men and enslave all the women. And that's what the Persians wanted. That's what the other Greek cities wanted to happen to Athens. The Spartans didn't do anything to Athens. They left Athens alone. And there are many different explanations for this. One explanation is Sparta wanted to maintain a bunch of power in the Greek world. they destroyed Athens, then Persia could come back and destroy Sparta, okay? But another explanation is, well, guess what guys? The upper nobility of Sparta and the upper nobility of Athens, they're good friends with each other. Okay, do you understand? Rich people tend to marry each other. They tend to be good friends with each other, okay? So Athens and Sparta weren't really enemies, do you understand? They had to fight this war because of the internal pressures from the low nobility, but because this war is killing off so much low nobility, it maintains a status quo. Does that make sense? All right? You guys understand so far? Any questions? All right, so I'm gonna conclude with evidence for this theory, okay? So what I just said, like war is really about killing off internal descent, not really about beating the other enemy. That's very controversial, okay? So I will give you some evidence for this theory and it's called ratutopia. So in the 1960s and 70s, there was an American researcher, American scientist, his name is James D. Cahoon, okay? And he was interested in the question, what would it be like for humans to live in a world of abundance? What would it mean for humans to live in a world where everything was perfect? where you didn't have to fight for food, where food was just given to you, okay? And utopia. What would it be like? Well, he couldn't really experiment on humans, so he decided to experiment on rats instead, okay? So he built this universe, okay? Basically this big house, and food was plentiful for rats. The food, the water was plentiful for rats. So rats could just play all day, okay? Now I'm not sure if you know about animal rats, but the thing about animals, and this is a very important idea, is that animals live in a heavily ritualized and rules-based world. It doesn't make sense, guys. We think of animals as chaotic, no, no, no. If you actually study their society, ants, monkeys, rats, they live in an extremely rule-based, heavily ritualized world, okay? So let me give you an example of this. So rats, when they mate with each other, what happens is this. A female rat is interested in having sex, okay? So she's going out and then a male rat spots this. He sees the female rat in heat. So what he does is he gets on a mound, okay? Where she can see him and he starts to dance. Okay? He starts to dance. And the female rat becomes interested And he sees she's interested, so he comes down and they start chasing each other, okay? They're having fun together. And then what she does is she runs home and hides herself in her burrow. The male rat just stands outside and waits for her to come out. After some time, she comes out and they run together again, and then she runs back again. They do this many, many times until finally she lets him catch him, and then they have sex. And then after they have sex, they have children, and they start a family together. Does that make sense? That's how rats usually behave. When they often like to play with each other, and they fight, but it's very playful. So there's lots of rules, there's lots of rituals in this rat society. But that's out in nature. In the world of James B. Kahoon, he creates a rat utopia, where everyone has enough to eat. And at some point the society breaks down. These rituals, these rules all break down. What happens is male rats, when they start fighting each other, they become very violent. They're no longer playing. They're actually trying to kill each other. And some actually die. And this like mating ritual, it breaks down. So the male rats don't even try to dance. They're not dancing. They just see a female and they rape her. Okay? And it's like gang rape. It's not one male, it's like lots of males raping her. These gangs of rats, they try to break into burls, homes and try to rape the wife, okay? The mother. And at first the husband is finding all these other rats, right? But eventually what happens is he gets tired and he just runs away, okay? He's just a bad family. Now the female rat is responsible for fighting off now the other rats. But she becomes so traumatized, she starts to beat everyone up, including her own children. So she kicks her children out of the house. It is a complete social breakdown. And after a few more months of this crap, the entire colony of rats dies. The entire society collapses. Doesn't make sense, all right? So this is what we call rat utopia. It's been done many times. And each time they do this, this happens. At some point, this society will collapse. And this makes no sense to us. Everyone has enough food to eat. Everyone should be happy. Why does society collapse? So there are different explanations for this. James B. Calhoun, his argument is if there's too much food, there's overpopulation. There's overpopulation, then that creates conflict. And the conflict causes the rules to collapse. The problem though with this theory is the colony never became overpopulated. There was space for everyone. But at some point, everyone started to fight each other. So this is my theory. And this goes back to the Peloponnesian War. It has to do with the idea of status. So in a world of abundance, in a world of wealth, who benefits the most? It's the elderly, all people, okay? All people can live a lot longer in a society that is wealthy and abundant, and abundant, okay? Doesn't make sense, okay? But then what happens is the status becomes locked in which prevents younger rats, younger people, from ascending into power and status. Does that make sense? OK? So the idea is, the metaphor is, these rats are online. I'm waiting for to climb the mountain. This is the mountain top. You're waiting and waiting to climb the mountain. And everyone's moving along. It's slow, but you're still moving along. And eventually, you'll reach the mountain top, which is where you want to be. But let's just say for whatever reason, the line stops moving, okay? Everyone's stuck in place. Well then you get very anxious. You get very stressed out. You get very agitated. You're like, when is it my turn? And it's never gonna come because the people at the top won't leave, okay? So what do you do? Well you start kicking the people behind you, right? You start fighting with each other. You understand? That's what we call rat utopia. In a world of abundance, in a world of extreme wealth, all people do not die. If they do not die, it is impossible for young people to ascend into power and status. And so they have all these energies, and because they cannot reach their potential, they become violent and start attacking each other. Okay? So that's rat utopia. That's what rats do. But if you look at the peloponnesian war and what happened between Athens and Sparta, It's really no different. Okay? It's really no different. They were killing each other for no reason. Extreme violence, which led to nothing. Okay? 431 BCE, the political world was no different from 404 BCE. The only difference is a lot of young people died. Okay? In wars against each other. So that's my argument to you. If society's become too wealthy, you have a problem of rat utopia. OK? If rat utopia, societies will then engage in wars that will lead eventually to its collapse. And that's what happened to Athens. Does that make sense, guys? All right. Any questions about this? Does it make sense to you guys? All right? Any questions? Yeah? OK. So the question is, in the retuutopia, why do the mothers want to start attacking the kids? So this is actually a complicated question. The answer is this. Humans are different from rats. So humans have the ability to reason and to adapt to new circumstances. Does that make sense? Rats don't. There are these wolves in place. And if these rules are broken, then the rats don't know how to adapt. So if you're a rat mother, you have a husband. Your understanding is the husband will protect you from strangers. Your understanding is if someone is violent towards you, you have to be violent against that person. So in a situation where the husband leaves, the husband runs away or is dead, The mother does not understand this new order anymore. So the mother becomes the word we use is traumatized. You're traumatized, you can no longer reason, okay? You're so focused on protecting yourself, you attack everything and everyone, including your own children. Doesn't make sense. Yeah, this is an experiment because obviously this would not happen in real life, okay? There's no way the rats get free food in real life. So they have this experiment where the experimenters gave the rats free food every day and this is what happened. No, no, no, so the experiment is the rats were left by themselves, okay? The rats could do whatever they wanted. The only thing the experimenters did was feed them every day, okay? If you do that, if there's abundance in this well, then you have complete social collapse, okay? Okay, all right, so, okay, all you need to understand is this, okay? The entire society collapses, okay? How it collapses can be different from family to family. The entire society collapses, everyone dies at the end, okay? Do you understand? Okay, any more questions? Any more questions? So I know this is a lot to take in, okay? This is very confusing and this is very hard, but it's okay. Just ask any questions or points where you want me to clarify. Okay, so next class we will do Greek theater and then after that we'll do Greek philosophy which includes Plato, Socrates and Aristotle, okay?"}

So this class we are focusing on William Shakespeare. But before I do that, I want to give you an overview of how we will end the course. To end the course, we will focus on the four great modern civilizations that have fought for global dominance these past 20 years. These four great civilizations are the Russians, the Germans, the British, and the Americans. Now what's interesting about all four civilizations is that they all claim to be the ultimate Christian civilizations that are here to Rome. But because of the differences in their geography and their culture, they have different interpretations of Christianity and Romaness. So let's compare and contrast these four great civilizations. The Russians, as you know, Russia is the largest land mass in the world. It is huge. It is also really cold and dark. Okay, so the geography transformed the Russian character. Okay, Germany in contrast, it is within Europe and it does not have the natural boundaries that the other nations have. It is always being attacked and threatened by adversaries. Okay? The British, it's an island fortress. The Americans are the most interesting because it is a continental fortress. It is not only invincible, it cannot be invaded, but it also has all the resources it needs in order to have a thriving modern economy. Therefore, America can choose to isolate itself from the rest of the world. Okay? Now, because of the difference in geography, you have differences in Christianity and in its Romaness. So the Russians believe that they are here to the Byzantine Empire. And as such, they are the protectors of something called Eastern Orthodoxy. Okay, so to understand what Eastern Orthodoxy is, think of Augustine. Okay, we read Augustine, city of God. So it is a very mystical, metaphorical, collectivist attitude towards religion. In contrast, the Germans believe that they are here to the holy Roman Empire first initiated by Charlemagne. And as such, they are more Catholic than the Russians. Okay? Then you have the British who believe they are here to the real Roman Empire. And their religion is Anglinism. Okay, remember Anglinism, there's really little difference between Catholicism and Anglinism. When in Anglinism, you swear allegiance to the king of England, in capitalism you swear allegiance to the pope of the Vatican. And then you have the Americans who believe that they are the heirs to the Roman Republic, okay? Not the empire, the Republic, before the time of Julius Caesar, the best former government in the world. The religion, so the elite is something we call diast, okay? So they believe in God, but God as someone who is removed from the world. You also have many different sects of pantheism, okay? So the religion in America, it is very diffuse, very diverse, okay? So the different cultural outlooks will also determine their cultural identities. So for example, the Russians, they have, the thing that differentiates the Russians is, They have a very dark imagination. So some of the greatest literature, some of the greatest music philosophy actually comes from Russia. So think of Toystoy, Dostoevsky. In terms of music, you have Tchaikovsky and Shtevinsky. I will also show you that the Russians produce the greatest geopolitical leaders in history. So in the 20th century, the greatest geopolitical leader was actually Joseph Stalin. And I will show you this is the case when we move to the 20th century. Today, the greatest Yopulovic leader in the world is Vladimir Putin. So there's something about the Russian dark imagination that produces men of genius to lead their countries. The Russian cultural identity is the idea of mother Russia, the land itself, the nation, the people. It is divine. All right, and so the main objective of all Russian Yopulovic leaders is to protect its borders from enemies. because Russia is so huge and encompasses two continents, it has a lot of geopolitical enemies. So that's the Russian civilization. When we move to the Germans, the Germans are really interesting because the Germans have also one of the great human civilizations in history. So rather than a dark imagination, the Germans believe in the idea of will to power. We will discuss this when we discuss German philosophy, especially Nietzsche. But the idea is this, that we have the capacity to impose our will on reality. That's the idea of will to power. We are not subject to culture, we're not subject to reality. There are great men among us who can impose their will on all of us. And that's why you have Hitler and the Nazis. What the Germans believe in is the idea of limit-schrump. I know this is a hard word, it's a German word, But it's actually a pretty easy concept. The concept is called living space. So throughout its history, the German people have always been invaded, attacked by its adversaries. So to protect itself, it needs living space. It needs to move out and colonize its surrounding territories, Poland, Russia, Austria, and make it more German so that the German nation can thrive. Versible concept. But this is the concept that drives the German military strategy in World War I and World War II. Limits Rome. You have the British. And the British, as we discussed last class, they are very practical people. The philosophy is empiricism and utilitarianism. It's not a question of what is right or what is ideal. It's a question of what works now. The British are extremely practical. The British empire is based on the concept of white man's burden, meaning that the British culture is inherently superior to all other cultures. And as such, the British have a responsibility to go out and civilize and educate and enlighten all others. So this is the philosophy that drives the British Empire. The Americans are interesting because they are a new civilization and they try to base their culture on the ideas of enlightenment. So Rousseau, Kant, especially John Locke. Their driving ideology is the idea of manifest destiny. So the idea of manifest destiny is that it is the obvious will of God for America to control the entire western hemisphere. That's why Trump today is saying, we should take over Canada, we should take over Greenland, because that's always been part of the American understanding of the world. It is God's will that America will eventually control all the entire Western hemisphere. It kind of will eventually come into America as well, and eventually America will drive out all European powers, including Denmark and Britain, from the Western hemisphere. So next class we'll discuss America in greater detail. Today we will focus on the British Empire, which is founded by Wilms Shakespeare. So we will discuss William Shakespeare today. Next week we'll start to focus on the Russians and the Germans, okay? But these are the four great civilizations that will drive history from the 19th century up to today. And I will also show you later on that it is actually the conflict between these four great civilizations that will drive human creativity, science, technology, philosophy, okay? And that's why from about 1800 up until 2000, you had a tremendous flowering of ideas and culture. So that's the game plan for the rest of the semester. Any questions about this framework? Again, you don't have to know these ideas right away. I will explain them in detail to you as we move forward. But, understand, the overall framework is there are four different civilizations that will drive human modernity, and they are in conflict with each other, and it's because of this conflict that drives human innovation. Okay, let's move on. So the question we are looking at today is, how did Shakespeare transform English into the language of empire? So for the longest time, English is what they spoke on the British Isles, okay? maybe in the British Isles, primarily in England. So how did Shakespeare transform that into the language that everyone speaks today? English really is the language of empire. You think when you learn English, you're not just learning grammar and vocabulary, you are really learning a culture, a philosophy, an identity. All right, and what's amazing about English is that it has really created, It's really, through soft power, convinced everyone to believe that Anglo-American culture is really the best in the world when objectively speaking, it is not. You can make the argument that Russian and German culture is far superior to Anglo-American culture, but everyone, especially young people in the world today believes that Anglo-American culture is just vastly superior. And the reason why is because most people speak English and we absorb our understanding of the world through language, okay? All right, so that's the question we were looking at today. All right, so before we talk about Shakespeare, I want you to understand some basic principles about language, art, culture, and civilization, okay? The first major principle is great art, okay? Dante, Homer, Vermeer, Shakespeare. It lifts the soul of civilization and changes the neurological structure of societies, creating a new way of being unseen. Okay? So this is a really important idea where you have to understand that civilization has a collective consciousness. And what great art does is it seeps into this collective consciousness and we wires the brain to make the civilization see the world in a new way, which causes people to behave differently. So we discussed this about Homer and Dante, right? Especially Homer and Dante. Today I'll show you how Shakespeare roughly transformed the English imagination. All right, another idea I need you to understand is how poets transform civilization is they innovate in imagery, grammar, and vocabulary. Okay, and when they do that poets expand a civilization's capacity to imagine feel and think okay, so We will discuss Wilms Shakespeare Wilms Shakespeare did not live very long. He died at 52 Okay, so he was not alive for a very long time, but his accomplishments are amazing In his brief life, he wrote anywhere between 38 to 41 plays And he established the English cultural identity. Shakespeare is really the founder of English culture. And he established his English historical memory. And he did this by writing a lot of plays. So tragedies, histories, comedies, you've read some of them in school. So his accomplishments are tremendous. The reason why we don't know how many plays he actually wrote is he never published in his lifetime. All his plays were published after his death by his friends who are working with his notes as well as recollections from actors who participated in Shakespeare's plays. That's why, so we don't have actually anything written specifically by Shakespeare, okay? So keep that in mind. In his plays he used anywhere between 20,000 to 30,000 different words. So his range of vocabulary was just vast. What's really unique about Shakespeare is he introduced, and it was between 1700 to 3,500 new uses of words, what we call diction, okay? I'll show you what diction is later on. To put this in context, between the years 1500 and 1650, around 10,000 new words are being introduced into England because of revolutions in agriculture, in trade, in communication, in technology. Okay, so at this point in history, England is going out into the world and it's transforming a society and therefore it needs to bring in new words. What Shakespeare does that's really important is he transforms the British imagination in order to better absorb these new ideas. And he does so through new uses of words, what we call addiction. So this makes sense, guys. So let's examine how he does this. Let me give you an example. Let's look at the word dagger. Dagger means just a short sword. And it's a very common English word. But what Shakespeare does is he uses it in a really imaginative, metaphorical way that forces you to reimagine the world around you. So let's look at some examples. And these are my examples, by the way. They're not Shakespeare's examples. We will look at Shakespeare's examples later on. So the first example is, he is a dagger, fat and short. This is interesting because we see a dagger, we think of something that is thin. Let's say this is fat. So this forces you to think about what dagger as a metaphor. And this makes your mind think, oh, he's a dagger, fat and short. So it's impossible that on the surface he looks fat and short. But actually, as a person, he is lean and mean. He's very, very clever. He pretends he's stupid, but he has very precise cleverness. Okay? All right? So that's what Shakespeare does. He takes a traditional metaphor and he radically reverses or or inverts it to force you to reimagine things in a new way. That's the first example. Second example is, I daggered him with questions. Now the word dagger actually exists in English language, but it means you carry dagger with you. So they say, I am daggered. It means there's a dag my pocket. And that's the traditional use of dagger. But there's no reason why you can't do what Shakespeare does and says, I daggered him with questions, which means I stab him with questions. I'm threatening him with questions. I ask a lot of questions. And this is very visual. It's very imaginative. Now, the third example is his voice is daggily. Daggily as a word does not exist. But because you know what the word daggily means, you can imagine what daggily could mean, right? A voice that is like mine, very high, high, high. And which you feel is jabbing at you. So that's the genius of Shakespeare. he takes words that we use every day and he finds new ways of using it in his plays that forces us to reimagine the world in a different way. That's the power of Shakespeare. Now what this is saying is this. What Shakespeare understands is that language can be a portal into the neurological framework of our minds. So you might have some study some neuroscience or psychology, you know like our brain is structured by these things called synapses, okay, these pathways in our brain. And what Shakespeare understands is that by manipulating language in a new way you can also perform a sort of surgery on these synapses. Alright? Alright. So, Shakespeare asked music. The thing to remember about Shakespeare is his plays were meant to be formed as musicals. Today in school we have you read Shakespeare, but remember during the time of Shakespeare no one read him. You experience Shakespeare by going to his plays and his plays were musicals. When people spoke Shakespeare it was as though they were singing and also there were lots of like dance routines within the place as well. These are people who are extremely ordinary, okay, who are going to Shakespeare as a form of match entertainment. It's almost like the equivalent of like going to movies today. And the way that Shakespeare creates music in his place is through a device called Iomic Pentameter. Iomic Pentameter, you know, right? It's, Iambis is just the arrangement of syllables where you have one that is deep and then another that's high. So, deep, high, deep, high, deep, high, deep, high, deep, high. When you have ten syllables, it's called a pentameter. Okay? So an example, of course, is two B, or not two B, or that, it, the, quick. So, you understand how this works, right? Low, high, low, high, low, high. And Shakespeare does that throughout his plays. That's why he comes across as musical. But if it's musical, then then it's easy to remember, because it becomes like a song, right? It's really easy for us to remember songs. So, emic pentameter, Shakespeare plays are memorable, beautiful, and resident, meaning they touch our souls. And again, these are ordinary people. So through emic pentameter, Shakespeare is performing a surgery on the imagination of civilization, right? All right, so having said that, Let's go into some brief history about Shakespeare. During the time of Shakespeare, theater is extremely popular around the country. And theater is primarily the means of mass entertainment. It's also the means of mass education. If you want to know about history, if you want to know about culture, you go to the theater. Now, the problem with this is that during the time of Shakespeare, around the 16th century, as we discussed last class, there's major conflict going on between the Protestant religion and the Catholic religion. And so the Queen Elizabeth is concerned about theater as a means of creating the scent in society. So what they do is they force all the theater productions to be placed in a suburb of London. And that's where Shakespeare is going to work. By doing that Shakespeare is being introduced to all the major theater all that time. So Shakespeare never actually wrote anything that is unique. So Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Othello, King Lear, these are all plays that are part of the British theatrical imagination. But what he does that's different is he re-ematters the characters and uses his new diction into the place to make it beautiful. So this is the globe, which is where Shakespeare performed much of his productions, the Globe Theater. The thing I also remember about this time is theater is low class. So in this district, there are lots of brothels. People go to theater and they get drunk, okay? They're drinking, they're spitting, they're eating stuff. They're also participating in something called, in a gamut activity called bare baiting. Bare baiting is really strange, The idea is you take a bear, you chain him up, you blind him, okay, and then you have dogs attack him, and then you bet who wins, the bear or the dogs. This is a really popular thing to do at this time. So it just shows you that we think of Shakespeare as a very high class, and we teach Shakespeare as a high class, but at this time Shakespeare is a very, very low class, and Shakespeare's plays are performed right beside bear-baiting venues as well as brothels. This is important because if Shakespeare is reaching to the masses, he's educating the masses into a global imagination. Shakespeare and theater, it's so detested by the upper class that from 1642 to 1660, the Perotens banded from England. Remember we discussed the Perotens and how they're obsessed with control. They hate alcohol, they hate fun, they hate theater, especially theater, they hate Shakespeare, okay? So they banned it. So during this time, Shakespeare is extremely controversial. So having gone into the history, let's discuss the genius of Shakespeare, okay? You do Shakespeare in school, you've read quite a few of his plays, so I'm not gonna go too deeply, but I'm gonna focus on one example, that distinguishes Shakespeare from all other playwrights, okay? to use is Hamlet. Hamlet, the story you know, it's a very simple story. It's about this Prince of Denmark, Paul Hamlet. He's going to university in Germany, I believe, Wittgenstein, which is where Martin Luther went. He comes home and then he's visited by the ghost of his dead father. The ghost of his dead father tells Hamlet, I was killed by your uncle Claudius who now has stolen the throne from me as well as married my wife Gertrude, mother. It is your responsibility as my son to seek vengeance against Claudius. Okay, so that's the mission of Hamlet. The problem is that Hamlet, he is a very analytical person. He thinks too much. Paralysis is analysis. Okay, so he spends entire play thinking about how to kill him, kill Claudius, but also whether or not to kill Claudius. And this is why we believe that Hamlet is Shakespeare's best play because it is a very deep philosophical work and in many ways Hamlet is really the expression of Shakespeare. You may not know this but Shakespeare had a son called Hamlet and Hamlet actually died when he was young. So a lot of scholars of Shakespeare and there are like thousands of scholars on Shakespeare believe Hamlet is Shakespeare's most personal play. All right so we're going to go into a bit of Shakespeare and look at the most famous Sylla Cree in Shakespeare to understand how he thinks, how he writes. So again this is the Atomic Metameter. To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows about rageous fortune, Mortaric arms against the sea of troubles, and by opposing end them, To die, to sleep, no more, and by asleep, to say we end the heartache In a thousand natural shocks, that flesh is here to, To the consummation, devoutly to be wished, To die, to sleep, to sleep, per chance to dream. Aye, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death, James and they come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause. There's respect that makes calamity of so long life. Does conscious stuff make cowardice of us all? And does the native hue of resolution is slicked over with a pale cast of thought? And then the prices of great pith and moment with this regard, their currents turn awry and lose name of action. Okay, so some brief comments about the slick way. First of all, as you can understand, it's beautiful. It's also, if you think about it, pretty easy to read. There are lots of really complicated words in the speech, but it's really smooth. If you read it for yourself, it's really smooth, and that's the power of amic metameter. If you really want to be fluent in English, just read Shakespeare Loud for a few months, and your English will be perfect. The British really are the best practitioners of English. read magazines like The Economist. It's really the best written magazine in the world. And you think to yourself, well, do the British invented English? No, okay. Just because you invent something doesn't mean you're good at it. So the Chinese invented gunpowder, compass, printing, paper, didn't really get us anywhere. The fact of matter is that in England you're expected to read and know Shakespeare. So it's Shakespeare that allows the British to have amazing English. All right, so this is very complicated, but it's actually not that deep. Okay, it's not like Dante. Dante is very, very deep, but Shakespeare is actually not that deep. All right, so let's look at what it actually means with these words. Okay, to be or not to be, that is the question. Against the misfortune in our lives, is it more brave and to bear it or to step against it. I no longer want to bear this pain. Let me sleep. I no longer want to feel my heartache and my body become wicked and injured. That is my wish. I want to sleep and to dream. But that is a danger, isn't it? When we are dead, we cannot control what we dream. And that is what frightens me. And that's why I continue to bear the most misfortunes around me. It is my own mind that has made me a coward and why each time when I become determined, my resolve breaks apart and I cannot act. That's what he's saying. That's literally what he's saying, no difference. But of course, when you do this, when you simplify Shakespeare, you lose the beauty and richness of Shakespeare. So another question then is, why is Shakespeare so complicated? What's he trying to do with his language? So the first thing that he's trying to do is he's trying to use language as a mechanism to convey different realities, different meanings. So when you Shakespeare, with each of his plays, there are many different layers of meaning that can be true at the same time. So let me show you an example of this. Let's look at the first possible interpretation of to be or not to be. You can say it means to die or to live. I cannot decide. I do not know. It's more brave to live a painful life or to run away from it and escape into death. So this is saying that Hamlet is overwhelmed by the moral dilemma he's put in. He cannot escape. He has to avenge his father, right? Or he cannot sleep. But avenging his father means killing his uncle, who his mother loves. It's an impossible moral dilemma. He doesn't want to deal with it. So he wants to kill himself. That's one possible interpretation. Another possible interpretation is to kill or not to kill, I do not know. Is it more good to let those who do evil suffer their own fate, or should I stop their evil and end their lives? So you can interpret this as saying, he's asking himself, how should he kill Claudius? Should he kill Claudius? That's a different interpretation. Yet another interpretation is, should I follow my fate, or should I defy it? Is it more brave and good to do as I am told or to fight against my fate, and in so doing, perhaps die? So this is a much more deeper and richer meaning where he's talking about faith and life in general. He's making the argument that we have no free will. We are forced into a situation where we must do what faith tells us. And in this situation, what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have free will? Where you're controlled by the forces of faith around you. Okay, so that's a much deeper meaning. And then the last deep meaning is, what is the point of existence? I do not know. When we exist, we must face pointless questions in our lives. Should we suffer or should we fight? So this is the deepest meaning where he's actually asking, what is existence? What is the point of all this? How do we get here? What is the purpose of existence? So there are four possible interpretations of this speech. And they're all correct. You can interpret them in any way they want. So it's the first power of Shakespeare where he's forcing you to interpret his speech in different ways, okay? The second part of Shakespeare is it's visual, okay? In this tradition, in this oral culture where no one reads and writes, well, most people don't read and write, most people access information through words, right? And in this tradition, words are images, right? So let's go over the siliquae and see how these are images, okay? So when Hamlet says, suffer the slings and arrows about racist fortune, or take arms against a sea of troubles and by posing and them, the audience is seeing these pictures. They're seeing a movie in their heads. Okay, that's the attraction of Shakespeare. Okay, do you guys see this? Is it clear to you guys? All right? And because you're seeing pictures, they remember all this. Okay, when you talk to an English person, It's amazing how much Shakespeare that person knows subconsciously. Another image, okay? In that sleep of death, what do you say come? When I've shoveled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. All right? So this is an image of a person who's dead, so his soul goes up to heaven. But what's in heaven? What's in that sleep of death? No one knows. Okay? Another image. The native heel of resolution is sliggled over it with a pale cast of thought. So this is a complicated sentence, but it's really about how something that is clear to us, once we think about it, becomes very dark and unclear. So that's a power of Shakespeare. It's a visual language. All right, another example. In the price of great piffing moment, there are currents turn awry and losing of action. So imagine a ship, it's going in direction, you're set on that path, but the moment you think about it, the moment you think deeply about what you're doing, the ship collapses. You don't know where you're going anymore. So is that clear to you guys? All right, so another example of the Poff Shakespeare is Julius Caesar. I'm not sure if you read Julius Caesar in school, but Julius Caesar, it's a very, I mean, the plot is very simple. Julius Caesar, he has defeated all his enemies in the Romans of war, and his friends, Brutus, Cassius, they're worried that he'll become a dictator. They're worried that he'll become king. So they plot to kill him, and Brutus and Cassius and all the conspirators kill Julius Caesar, And then, Brutus and Cassius think this is over. But Mark Anthony, who is Caesar's lieutenant, he's the worst vengeance. And Mark Anthony and Octavian will combine forces to destroy and kill Brutus and Cassius. And that's a plot of Julius Caesar. Not very complicated, okay? But in Julius Caesar, you will find some of the greatest speeches in the English language. It's stunning speeches. And in the speeches, you will find an example of how Shakespeare understands language as a surgery on the brain, how through speech making, how through language, you can actually transform the neurological structure of the human brain. So let's look at an example of this. Mark Anthony and Buddhists are going to engage in a speech competition. They're going to debate each other. This will be the first to give a speech and then he'll be followed by Mark Anthony. So the strategy of Brutus is you use a rhetorical strategy called the antithesis. The antithesis is basically very simple. You have two opposing ideas, and they are opposed to each other. So the idea is I am Brutus, I am honorable. You know me as honorable because my name is Brutus, which is also the name of Lucius Brutus who founded the Roman Republic. You know me as honorable person. Now, who is Caesar? Caesar is ambitious. Honor and ambition can not go together. So I love Caesar, but because he was ambitious, he wanted to enslave us, out to free us. Therefore I had to kill him. So that's the idea of Brutus. He's trying to create a economy between Caesar and himself. If you know me, Brutus, as honorable, then you must believe that Caesar is ambitious. This rhetorical strategy is what we call antiphysis. In the human mind, you just see these two things separate from each other. Mark Anthony then responds to Brutus using something called the chiasmus. Okay? The chiasmus is really interesting. The chiasmus tries to take these two opposing principles and combine them together. Alright? So what Mark Anthony will say is that Caesar was ambitious and honorable as honorable and ambitious as Brutus. This is what we call chiasmus. It's called, it's an ABBA structure. When you do that, when you have a trismus, you collapse the antithesis. Remember, the antithesis are two separate ideas that cannot meet together, exclusionary. The trismus shows you like these are mirrors of each other. Okay? When you do that, in the Roman imagination, the Roman mind, you then collapse the continuity between Brutus and Caesar. And you see them as one and the same. But if it was Brutus that killed Caesar, then Brutus must be the less honorable and more ambitious one. Does that make sense, guys? Julius Caesar. So let's see an example of this. All right. This is Brutus talking to the Roman crowd after the death of Julius Caesar. He's trying to explain his actions before the Roman crowd. He says, if then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer. You want to know why he killed Caesar? I'm going to tell you why he killed Caesar. Not that I love Caesar last, but I love Roe more. Had you rather Caesar were living and dying to all slaves, then that Caesar were dead to live all free men. This is an antiphasis, right? I love Caesar, but I love Roe more. This is antiphasis. This is also antiphasis. Caesar, if he were living, he would make us into slaves. If Caesar is dead, we will continue to live as free men. two exclusionary ideas developed by Brutus. Now what Mark Anthony is gonna do is, he's gonna collapse this, okay? He's gonna change your neurological structure. He's gonna change your synopsis within you through his speech making. Let's look at Mark Anthony. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious and sure he's an artable man, okay? So he's summarizing the argument made by Brutus. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not about cause. What cause withholds you than to mourn for him? This is a chasmus. Cause, cause, love mourn. Can you see that? He continues with the chasmus. But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassie's wrong. Who you all know are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, than I will wrong such honorable men. This is two examples of chiasmus, where word of Caesar and reverence match. Stood and lies match. For the chiasmus, he's collapsing this economy. Another example is here. The red match, the green match. This is what we call chiasmus. Does that make sense, guys? Have you guys learned this before? It's really important. You know these ideas. All right. So that's the power of Shakespeare. Through his language, through his rhetoric, he's transforming the British imagination so that they are more open, more fluid. They can absorb new ideas, and they can be more innovative. Now, as we discussed way back at the beginning of this course, Homer did the same thing. So let's compare and contrast Homer and Shakespeare. How was it able that they were both able to be founders of great civilizations? All right, first of all, they came at a time when there's a cultural tabular rasa. Tabular rasa just means blank slate. So Homer came at a time after the branchage collapse of Greece. The Maesanian civilization collapsed and now you have the Polish system. So it's a tabula rasa. So it's being with Shakespeare where Britain at this time, it is not an advanced culture as much as the French and the Spanish. Second is rapid cultural change where Britain is undergoing all these revolutions. When it's undergoing all these revolutions, people are anxious and they're looking for new ideas. Oral culture. We talked about this, where if you live in an oral culture, people have a stronger memory and have a greater imagination. That's why they're able to sit through three hours of Shakespeare at one go, at one, one go and visualize his language. And this is like the most common person in Britain, okay? These are not the elite. These are just commoners. And so, we have an oral culture of a stronger memory, imagery, vibrancy, and flexibility. They did, look guys, I hate to say this, but back then they were smarter than we are today. We have, you know, Google and chat TBT, but if you think about it, all these things are just making a stupid, okay? Opening cooperative competition just means that in their times Homer was just one of thousands of bars that are traveling around Greece and singing legends of the the Trojan War and the Golden Fleece. So what they were doing was, they were stealing from each other. Shakespeare was stealing from everyone else. And that allows for rapid innovation when you have an open, cooperative competition. Democratic sensibilities, this is really important. Homer was talking to ordinary people. Shakespeare was talking to ordinary people. The problem with today's culture is there's a lot of market differentiation where if you feel that you are high class, you're a university professor, you don't want to talk to common people, you want to talk to other university professors. That leads to stagnation and segmentation, okay? Free market, really important idea where, how do you know if you look good or not, okay? Well, in a university, you know if you're good or not, if a professor tells you you're good or not, but how do you know the professor knows what he's talking about? The free market provides an objective feedback loop which forces you to constantly innovate and improve, right? How do you know you're good? Because people come and listen to you. They pay attention to your place. They want to pay for your place. Right? And it turned out that because of the free market and open corporate competition, Shakespeare proved to be the best. Okay. And the last idea is poet as profit. Okay. This is a really important idea where, okay. Yes. Shakespeare became very wealthy because of the place he was producing. He came from a very calling background. He was not very wealthy. He didn't go to university. That's why today there are scholars who believe Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare because he didn't go to Oxford or Cambridge. Christopher Marlowe went to Oxford or Cambridge but not Shakespeare. So you have a lot of scholars who actually believe because he's not well educated. He could not have written a place he wrote. But what drove Shakespeare and what drove Homer is the idea that you have a divine mission to spread the truth. So Shakespeare and Homer, they were rich, they were popular, they were famous, but they were not driven by money. They were driven by a divine messianic mission to transform the world. Does that make sense, guys? This is really important to understand. Great artists are driven by a messianic mission to change the world for the better. You're not driven by money or power or fame. All right, so having done that, let's recap and summarize the three great poets that have impacted Western civilization, okay, and compare and contrast the three. All right, you have Homer, we found the Greek civilization. You have Dante, who we discussed in great detail this semester. He's the founder of modernity, and you have Shakespeare, who was the founder of the British Empire, all right? So again, Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare were all Democrats in their heart. Homer was a Roman bard who went around the different polices to sing and entertain the masses. Dante was revolutionary because he wrote the line comedy not in Latin, which was the language of the educated elite, but in the vernacular in Tuscan, so that ordinary people could access it. And by doing so, he transformed Tuscan into the official Italian language that is spoken today. Shakespeare again was a playwright. He wrote and attained the masses. That's why in Shakespeare you have such, I mean it's very offensive, some of his language, okay? All right. They have different conceptions of language though, all right? And this is very key for us to remember. For Homer, language is a window into the human soul. So we go back to the Iliad and the Odyssey. It was really about what drove us humans. Achilles was driven by the thirst for fame. Odysseus was driven by his love of Panoply and his son Tamakis. So both the Iliad and the Odyssey were tremendous psychological studies of what it means to be human. And you have Dante. Dante uses language as a portal into the mind of God. What is the universe? How did God create the universe? What does God want from us? Okay, that's the divine comedy. Shakespeare is very different, okay? Shakespeare creates a new idea of language as a reality onto itself, all right? A reality onto itself. So what I mean by that is with Shakespeare, it's not really deep meaning. It's very hard to find deep truths in Shakespeare. But the language is beautiful. And this is the culture we live in today where, you know what, people write novels, they use beautiful language, beautiful description, great imagery, but there's really not great truths, deep truths, grand truths, in the novels that are written and produced today, okay? So let me give you example of what it means to have language as a reality onto itself, all right? So let me show you what this means. And to do so, I'm gonna use a different poet, His name is John Keats. Okay, John Keats. And this is from his most famous poem, To Autumn, which is considered the greatest English poem of all time. All right, so let's read it together and then I'll show you how this is a reality onto itself. Where are the songs of spring? I, where are they? Think not of them, thou has thy music to you. While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day and touch the stubble plains with rosy hue, then in a well-fought choir, the small gnats mourn among the river shallows, borne aloft or sinking as I win lifts or dies. And frogrown lambs, loud bleat from hilly borne, heads crickets sing and now trebles soft, the red-breast whistles my garden crop and gathering swallows twitter in the skies. Okay, so it's beautiful. What does it mean? All right, I'm gonna show you what it means, okay? This is language as reality onto itself. It is language visualizing a new world, all right? So you see how the words match, right? While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day and touch the stubble plains with rose and hue. It's a painting, guys. All right? This one sentence is a painting of a new world that you can see in your heart. Also, then in a well-fledged choir, the small gnats mourn among the vershalos, born aloft or sinking as a light when lives or dies. Okay. You can see the music within this picture. Right? This is not just a picture but it's a world that you can access because it's moving. It's alive. It's a power of language. Next sentence. And fro-grown lambs, loud beat from hilly-born, head-trick at sing, and now with treble soft, the red breath whispers from a garden crop. Okay? So you see what's happening where this poetry, it is entering your soul. And it is activating all your emotions, all your senses. There's the visual, okay, there's a sound, there's a smell, there's a touch, and gathering swallows, Twitter in the sky, okay? What's a poetry? Poetry is the expression of a new world that you can access, all right? And when you access it, when you enter it, it transforms your soul and your imagination, your capacity to think, feel, and imagine. Does that make sense to you guys? All right, so let's summarize what we learned. Shakespeare turns English into the world's linguistic internet, a platform in which all cultures, ideas, and worldviews can meet and crossbreed. So Shakespeare's transforming English into this extremely flexible, beautiful, memorable language language, which allows everyone to learn English well. If you want to learn English well, just read Shakespeare. Okay? That's all you have to do. And then you can master English. So it's a linguistic internet. For the first time, all cultures are able to meet together in, within the language, language and communicate with each other. Okay? There's a problem with this. There's a problem with this. The problem is this. So this exchange is mediated through Anglo-American civilization, which is at its heart, Euthetarian, skeptical, and empirical. So when you embrace English, when you experience English, you're also experiencing British culture, history, and philosophy. And as we discussed, the three main philosophies of British culture are Euthetarian, skeptical, and empirical. Utitarian we discussed last class, it just means that we should do things that works as opposed to what is right. Skeptical is to be skeptical of our capacity to reason and to think. If you think you know something, you probably don't know it. And then empirical just means the only thing you know is things you experience. So in other words, Anglo-American culture, even though it dominates the world, it's pretty lackluster. It's very narrow-minded. It's very practical. It's pretty mediocre. And if you want to know what I mean by that, think about, think to yourself, what was the last great American novel you had? I mean, there are lots of great Russian, German novels. So Russians you have, and a Korean war and peace, common punishment, the Germans have great philosophy, Kant, Nietzsche, Hegel, we'll go into that later on, okay? But I struggle to think about what great art the Americans have produced, even though they are the most wealthy, most powerful country that has ever existed in human history, okay? And I mean, Shakespeare is great. I mean, like, like, like, I love Shakespeare. King Lear is one of the greatest plays ever written. But Shakespeare compared with Dante, I mean, I don't know. Okay, Dante is like, you are in the mind of God. You can feel this is divine, okay? But with Shakespeare, you're like, this is beautiful, but isn't a pretty nothingness? Okay? That's a question I have. And again, to be fair, it's been a long time since I actually read Shakespeare. I've read most of his plays, but it's been a long time since I've read Shakespeare. So what I want to do later on, maybe a few years from now, is actually teach Shakespeare and see if I'm wrong. But right now, I have to say, Shakespeare is not as impressive as Homer and Dante. I think Homer and Dante are the two greatest poets who ever lived. All right, so let me give you an example of what I mean by how British culture is kind of narrow-minded. All right, so this is considered the greatest epic in the English tradition called Paradise Lost by John Milton. And it's really about Adam and Eve, right? Why did Adam and Eve eat that forbidden fruit and why were we banished from the Garden of Eden? And look, it's 12 books, which is a model of the great epics of integrity, Homer and Virgil. And there are some parts of Paradise Lodge, which are beautiful. I mean, I love Paradise Lodge. I've taught Paradise Lodge before. But the reality is this. As an epic, as a grand vision of the world, it doesn't really work. I mean like, I don't really think the plot, the vision of Paradise Lost, it is as fully formed, and as grand as Homer and as Virgil and as Dante, okay? And so Paradise Lost, you might have a chance to read it in college one day, but it's very limited and narrow-minded, epic. All right, so let's conclude. All right, so we did Britain today, okay? And I hope you understand British culture. It's not in fortress. It sees itself as a Hindu Roman Empire. It is an Anglican religion. It's driven by the empiricists and the utilitarian philosophies, okay? And Shakespeare is the founder of this great civilization. Next class, we'll do America, okay? And then after we do these two cultures that now dominate the world, we'll move on to the Germans and the Russians. Okay? That's the game plan. But what's today's class clear to you? Do you understand Shakespeare now? Does this make sense? Okay? Any questions? Anything you're not clear about? Any questions? Okay, yeah. So, okay. So the question is, what is like, like, so Shakespeare is played off, is performed all the time. and you are forced to reach Shakespeare in school. So where is, where do we get these plays from? Okay, so let me explain to you what's happening. All right, okay, so Shakespeare's plays. All right, so when Shakespeare was alive, he didn't really publish his plays, okay? He didn't publish his plays. And there are many reasons why he didn't publish his plays. First of all, in this culture at this time, there's no copyright. So if you publish your play and someone steals it, too bad. So you're not incentivized to publish your play. Second of all, people don't really read and write. So there's really no market for his plays. So even if you were to publish his plays, he would not make money off it, okay? So what he did was he wrote his plays down, primarily for his actors to memorize. But the benefit of Amicant Pataminar is that actually the speeches are pretty easy to memorize. Okay? And when he was alive Shakespeare was a national celebrity. He performed his plays in front of the king and queen. He was very, very well known, extremely famous. He was looked down upon by the nobles, but I mean he was very, very wealthy and he himself will go on to purchase a noble title for himself. So he was extremely successful. When he was alive, people didn't really fully understand his genius. It's only about 100 years, 20 years afterwards when people really appreciated his genius. And his play spread throughout Europe, especially Germany. The Germans loved Shakespeare. And it was only after his death that people realized what a unique genius Shakespeare was. So after his death, his friends, and I don't remember their names, but his friends want to remember him. They want to memorize him. So they start to publish his plays. It's something called the First Folio. So basically what they did was, They took the notes from Shakespeare, so some surviving manuscripts, not complete, but some of his notes. They also got the actors to basically write down what they remembered. They remember a lot because these are actors. Actors have extremely good memories. So they were able to remember exactly the speeches. And then they'll make edits. Okay? And this is the first portfolio. First folio, okay? But as you can imagine, over time, there'll be a lot of additions and mistakes. All right? But, so today, there are thousands of Shakespeare scholars and they argue over certain words. Did Shakespeare really have this word? Or was it a later addition, okay? And I mean, it's a really silly thing to do I guess as I explained to you, the genius of Shakespeare was to imagine language as this very fluid, flexible, imaginative tool for you to experience reality onto itself, okay? So to argue, I mean like, was it a dagger or a data? Or a dasher, okay? And people will argue this. I mean like, does it really matter? I mean like, a lot of Shakespeare is just word play, right? there's really no deep truth in Shakespeare. And quite honestly, I mean like, these words are not gonna change the deeper meaning of Shakespeare. Okay, so it's something that I think overpaid English professors do, okay, just because they're nothing better to do, okay? They argue about what was in the first Fort Leo, what was edited out, what was added to. They're trying to figure out what was Shakespeare's original intention. And I mean Shakespeare, think of him as a musician. He's trying to sing beauty and truth. But a lot of it is not intentional. A lot of it is not conscious. A lot of it is just being driven by inspiration and intuition and imagination. So when we go back to Hamlet, the Silicui, if we change a few words, it doesn't really change the meaning of the Silicui. Does that make sense, Eva? Great question though. Any other questions? Yes. Okay. So it's a great question. White men's burden. This is a concept that was introduced during the age of imperialism towards the end of the 19th century by Robert Kipling, the white men's burden. We have a responsibility as white people to go and civilize the dark people in Africa and in China and other places. What's your connection to Shakespeare? Okay, first of all, Shakespeare was not interested in the world. He was very provincial. He was interested in London and that was about it. I'm not even sure if he traveled, okay? This is a bit whether or not he actually speaks French and Latin. He knows a bit of Latin, but this is a bit whether or not he speaks French. So Shakespeare was not an imperialist. He was not a globalist. He didn't really care about the world. But within Shakespeare is British culture, okay? He wrote up histories, tragedies, and comedies. It was like 38 to 41 plays. And together, they are the encapsulation of British culture, right? So as Britain was going out into the world and conquering people and colonizing nations, You need to explain why this was happening. Why are you going and killing people for no particular reason? This is why Shakespeare is important. Because Shakespeare allows them to say, well, do you ever Shakespeare? Do you have 38 to 41 plays that are beautifully written? Well, if you don't, then that means you're not civilized. We have Shakespeare, you don't have Shakespeare, that means we're superior to you. Therefore, we will teach you Shakespeare. will educate you in Shakespeare, will civilize you. So this is not just Shakespeare. There are other individuals as well. But primarily Shakespeare. Shakespeare is really the greatest cultural product of the British. So that doesn't make sense, Echo. So Shakespeare himself was not an imperilist. He didn't really care about that sort of thing. but his legacy will be co-opted by British imperialists in order to justify and explain whether going out and killing so many people around the world and stealing the resources. But we'll discuss this when we enter the age of imperialism, which is towards the 19th century. And then this will lead us into the great wars, World War I and World War II. All right, any more questions? Yeah, I understand the question, okay, great. So you're doing Othello in class, and you're looking at Othello from the perspective of race and identity and culture, right? Okay, so let's discuss how Shakespeare wrote his plays. So he wrote around 40 plays before he died at 52, which meant that he was basically producing one, two, three plays a year. That's a lot guys. If you read Shakespeare, the themes are extremely diverse. You have Othello, who's a Moor, who kills his wife Desimona. But you also have Merchant of Venice, Julius Caesar. So there's a wide range of his plays. And so the question is, how did he do it? Well, he was stealing it from everyone. Remember, this is a huge market for theater. There are dozens and dozens of really talented playwrights in London and England who are producing wonderful works. So he's just stealing these plots from different playwrights. But what makes Shakespeare unique and special and superior to these other playwrights is, first of all, his characters. He has a deep empathy for his characters. He goes into the mind of his characters And he says, if I'm this person, how would I behave? So that's one thing that makes him unique. Second, as we discussed, is his use of language. Just the fluidity and the beauty and the flexibility of his language. And the last thing is the realism, which is he's trying to make the plot as realistic as possible. He's trying to remove the supernatural elements. He's interested in psychology. So when you look at Othello, he's asking himself, why is it that a man who loves his wife, what could drive him to kill his wife? That's the question he's asking. He doesn't see Othello as a black person in a foreign culture. He doesn't see it that way. I want to ask myself a question. If you truly love a person, what would drive him to kill her? But because the theme is so universal, it allows you to impose cultural readings. So he himself was not interested in the issue of race, culture, and identity. Quite honestly, at this time in history, There's no such thing as race or identity. Okay, remember I keep on saying this, but for most of you of your ministry, we differentiate ourselves according to race. We differentiate ourselves according to community. Okay, so within England, people didn't care about the French or the Germans. They hate, but you know what? They cared about each other and they hated each other. Remember, the main conflict in England at this point is the conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants, okay? So they weren't focused on the world, they were focused on each other. So these cultural readings come later, they come from today. Shakespeare himself was only interested in psychology. What drives us humans? All right, and you can see that manifests itself in Othello and in Hamlet. And quite honestly, I'll be honest with you, I think it's really unfair to Shakespeare that we're doing this. All right, I mean like, it wouldn't be much more interesting class We stop asking ourselves, oh, Othello was a black person. So how black people persecuted it? And ask yourselves, Othello is a man of great achievement. He's a man of great, tremendous pride and honor. But it's impossible that in certain circumstances, this can be used against him. And that's the plot of Othello, which makes it a Greek tragedy, right? The Greeks were concerned about hubris, arrogance, fate. These are the questions that the Greeks were concerned about. So in many ways, Shakespeare saw himself as continuing the Greek legacy. All right? And the fact that we're focusing on questions like race, culture, and identity, it sort of like degrades the play. Because it's saying like, if you're a black person, then you may always be manipulated and persecuted. And quite honestly, it's also reinforcing certain racial stereotypes about black people as very violent and emotional. Okay? So if I were to teach Othello, it's a great play, and I've never taught Othello, but I would focus more on the human aspect of Othello, as opposed to the racial aspect of Othello. Does that make sense? Okay, great. Any more questions? That's a great question. How is Shakespeare able to focus on human psychology, given the fact that he's not well educated? Okay, I will make the argument, it is precisely because he's not well educated, that he focused on human psychology. Okay? When you are educated, you are educated into cultural attitudes, norms, and values of the elite. But if you're not educated, then what you do is you observe humans as they are without prejudice. You want to know, you want to know how are we as humans? And you have not been indoctrinated to believe certain things. Okay, if you go to school you do on school and you go to university Well first thing you're taught is only what you get at people are capable of deep psychological insights And that's a prejudice. That's a failing Because the Shakespeare never went to school. He's able to see himself as equal to other people And therefore he's able to have tremendous empathy for other people and therefore he's able to understand the psychology in his own psychology He's able to see people as a reflection of his own psychology and that's what drives his genius. And that, quite honestly, that's also what drove Homer. So I mean, I hate to say this, but I did go to Yale University. I studied English literature there so I spent a year studying Shakespeare. And I was not impressed with the education I got at Yale because, again, the problem of one of these elite universities is you're taught to think in a very rigid way that inhibits your empathy, your curiosity, and your own psychological understanding. In fact, I'll be honest with you. I watch a lot of YouTube videos and like to do research for these talks. I'm always impressed by how these self-taught historians know much more about history than these academics at Yale, Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard. That's something that I've observed. You're much better off talking to an individual who has a passion for history and who spent his entire life asking himself what is history but never really got a form of education, never got a doctorate in history, as opposed to a Harvard PhD in history. That's a hard lesson I learned in my life. It was very hard for me to accept because I am an elite graduate of elite university. But what Shakespeare understood intuitively is, no, it's the common people, the ordinary people, that's where the truth lies. Not in books, but in people. And that's what makes Shakespeare so great. He is first and foremost an anthropologist, psychologists of people. You want to understand how people think and behave. And when you read his plays, that's what you experience for yourself. He's really interested in the psychology of Aego, Desimona, and Othello. That's what he's curious about. He's not interested in these structural forces that drive conflict and persecution among these people. That comes later. That's what we do to Shakespeare today. But back then he was only interested in what it meant to be a human being. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay, great. Any more questions, guys? You want to ask more about Othello? I'd be happy to answer, even though my reading of Othello might be different from what you're being taught in class. Okay. Okay, so the question is, how does Shakespeare develop his themes? So Othello, sorry. So Othello, Hamlet, King Lear, all these plays are well-known stories. They're extremely well-known stories. But Shakespeare, he is curious about people. Because every day, if you work in a theater, you deal with people all the time. Your customers are people. Your actors are people. And what he discovered over time is people are very complicated, people are very emotional. People have their own psychology, there's diversity among people, okay? And so what he does that's really interesting is he takes these legends and he combines them together, okay? He takes these legends and he takes these observations of human individuals and he combines them together to create Shakespeare. In other words, what he does that's unique is he takes these characters, King Lear, Hamlet, It turns them into people he's observed. When you do that, you get a lot of interesting psychology. So let's imagine you become Hamlet, and you were in a circumstance where your father has come and told and given you a mission to go kill your uncle because he's sleeping with your mother. And how would you behave? Well, you probably would be Hamlet. You'd be very confused, you'd be very distraught. Okay? Does that make sense? Same thing with fellow where, let's just say that you're this great champion, you're this great hero. Well, other people are gonna be jealous of you. Right? If other people are gonna be jealous of you, what they're gonna do is figure out how to get back at you. Okay? So it's not a racial issue, it's a human issue. If you're the top student in the school and every day the teachers are praising you, right? I'm pretty sure those teachers are gonna hate your guts. That's a fellow, right? That's a human thing. It's not a racial thing. It's not because he's black. I mean, it's because he's such a accomplished individual. Okay? Does that make sense? All right. Great. Okay. So next class we do the American Revolution. All right?"}

So today we do Joseph Stalin. And I want to make you the argument that Joseph Stalin is probably the greatest man who ever lived, okay, for three reasons. The first reason is that Joseph Stalin, he is a poor high school dropout from Georgia, which is on the Frenchess of the Russian Empire. And he leads an extreme fringe in the Spice Poggle Party called the Bolsheviks into absolute power in Russia. That's the first reason. The second reason is that among the Bolsheviks, Stalin is the least impressive. Everyone else is intellectual with many books, many speeches, many achievements to his resume. But Stalin defeats them all and becomes the ultimate ruler of Soviet Russia. That's the second reason. And the third reason is during World War II, Soviet Union was up against Germany. So Stalin took a poor divided, isolated nation and defeated Germany and turned it into a global hegemon. So these are the three main reasons why I consider Stalin to be certainly the greatest man of the 20th century. And quite possibly, you can make the argument that he was the greatest man who ever lived. So let me reframe what I just said in a different way so it's clearer to you. The Bolsheviks should not have triumph. If you just looked at what's going on in the early 20th century in Russia, you would not have predicted that the Soviets would have won. Stalin should not become Soviet leader and the Soviets should not have won World War II. All these three things happened because Stalin willed this reality into being. He is what Friedrich Nietzsche would call the urban months. The urban months is someone who steps out of history and warps it to his will. That is Joseph Stalin. That is the argument I will make to you today. All right, so some basic history about Russia. As we discussed previously about Russia, Russia is very much a nation of a split personality. It is both Asian as well as European, both Christian and pagan, both enlightened as well as reactionary. And because of these contradictions, it leads to many rebellions and revolutions throughout Russian history. One of the most famous being 1825, a group of military officers, Khaled Asambuist, tried to overthrow the Tsar and install a military dictatorship. Ever since this event, Revolutionary discussion becomes sort of like a national pastime in Russia. Dostoevsky, both Dostoevsky and Toystoy were sympathetic to revolutions. 1853 to 1856 is a pivotal moment in Europe, in Russian history because that's when Russia loses the Crimean War to the Ottoman Empire backed by the French and the British. And this marks a limit to the expansion of Russia. So when we let Russia resolve its internal contradictions and its internal conflicts, it's by expanding eastwards and allowing the nobles to accumulate more land, more slaves, and that modifies a lot of these nobles. But in 1853 to 1856, after Russia loses the Korean War, Russia understands that it is backward and agricultural compared with Europe. So Alexander II, who was a star of Russia at this time, he embarks on a series of radical, liberal reforms. The most major being in 1861, he emancipates the serfs. The serfs are slaves who are tied down to the land. And by liberating them, he hopes to further industrialize Russia as well as create a more vibrant market economy, which is what you need to be a modern nation state. But as you can imagine, this creates a lot of pushback from the nobles who lose a lot of wealth and property because of these reforms. A fun fact about Axon II was he was very good friends with Abraham Lincoln. In fact, Act of the Second was a huge admirer of the American Republic. So much so that when in 1861, the American Civil War started, saw Act of the Second was worried that the French and the British were intervening on behalf of the Confederacy. The reason why is that, first of all, the American Confederacy provides a lot of cotton to the British and the French for their textile industry, as well as well the French and the British see America as a growing threat. So by supporting the Confederacy, they believe that they can divide and weaken America. So in response, Agenda Sackend publicly stated that if the French and the British ever declare an alliance with the Confederacy, then Russia would intervene on behalf of the union. And to show that he was serious, he said warships to New York and San Francisco to show that Russia would defend America. So this is forgotten, but this is a really fun fact about Russian history, that Axel II was a huge admirer of Abraham Lincoln, so they wrote letters to each other, and he did much to save the American Union in a time of crisis. Now, in 1881, his liberal reform stopped when he was assassinated. This was the day, he was assassinated on the day that he returned from a meeting where basically he was gonna promote constitutional monarchy in Russia. And then he was assassinated by a terrorist group called the People's Will. Now, there's a very good reason why the People's Will assassinated Alexander II. At this time in Russian history, there were a lot of revolutionaries who believed that to liberate Russia, you need to liberate the mindset of the peasants. The problem is the mindset loved the Tsar. And so the intellectuals felt that the idea of the Tsar enslaved the peasants from seeking enlightenment and freedom. And therefore, to send a signal to liberate the peasantry, you needed to kill the Tsar in an act of violence. And that's what happened in 1881. So this is the people's will. And what you will see is that they're very small people. There was at most 2,000. And they were founded right before the assassination of the second, 1879. And after the assassination, all the major members were quickly arrested by the secret police and executed. And they confessed to their crimes. That's why we know so much about them. But this creates a problem. The problem is this. If the secret police were so effective and capturing all the assassins right after the assassination, why weren't they effective in stopping the assassination? That's a curious question. In fact, if you think about some more, you have some other problems. For example, the People's Will, it is a terrorist organization. But where do they get the funding? This is always a problem when you are an underground organization. Where do you get your financing from? Another problem is if these are religious fanatics, they really believe that their mission is to liberate the present tree. They're probably very opinionated, and it's probably very hard to organize them into a hierarchy. So these are two major problems that the people's will and other terrorist organizations throughout Russian history will face, including the Bolsheviks. Now, to answer both questions, let's do a thought experiment. Let's just say you're a secret police, your task with monitoring and capturing these terrorists. Now, is it to give you a benefit to capture them, or is it to give you a benefit to assist them? All right, now this sounds like a silly question, but let's think about deeply. All right, so why don't you wanna support global extremists? Well, there's some very good reasons. It's risky, it's violent, it's unethical, it doesn't really help anyone, okay? So we should not help political extremists. But if you're a secret police and you ask yourself, what are the benefits of helping them? It turns out, there's quite a lot. All right? Let's go over them. Number one, by helping extremists, you defame the entire political opposition. Right? You make all the people who oppose us all look bad because look, these are fanatical, they're violent. Okay? That's one really good reason want to support extremists. Second is you want to foment internal dissent among political opponents. So the classic example is the Marxist group at this time in history are the Menshiviks. And they are intellectuals, and they believe heavily, in Marx. The Bolsheviks are led by Lenin, and they are an extreme group. The main conflict is the Menshiviks believe that for the revolution to happen, you have to follow Marxist prescription, which is you go from an autocracy to a bourgeoisie democracy, because that is what's gonna help Russia industrialize. Once industrialization happens, capitalism will automatically make the Poletariat class conscious. And when they're class conscious, they will unite and overthrow the bourgeoisie democracy to create the dictatorship of the Poletariat. That is the classical Marx theory of evolution towards a communist society. Lenin believed, no, we don't need this, okay? Because the Meshavik worldview is, we have to be patient, we have to wait for Russia to industrialize. Right now, the industrial workers in Russia is about 3% of the population, okay? The passenger is 80%. And Lenin's argument is, we don't have to wait for the politics to become 80% of the population. What we can do is create a vanguard party and lead the peasants into communist paradise, okay? And the Manchiviks say, when you do that, all you're doing is creating a peasant revolution, which will lead to a dictatorship of the peasantry. You'll be no different from the Tsar. All right, so eventually Lenin and the Bolsheviks will split apart from the Manchiviks, okay? And it would be to the benefit of the Sikapolites to support the Bolsheviks, right? And we'll see evidence for this later on. By supporting political extremism, you also induce political violence to justify more state control, right? You collect intelligence by implanting spies within these extremist groups. You can also arrest extremists to score political points within the bureaucracy, right? Because the single police is gonna pay a lot of money. How do they justify their salaries? Well, they arrest extremists that they support, okay? Also, you can use these extremists to assassinate political enemies. So you make the argument that within the secret police there's a faction of nobles who were outraged at the reforms of Axiom in a second, especially the thought of creating a constitutional monarchy which would limit the powers of their aristocracy. And therefore, they had the people who will kill Axiom in a second. You also have false flag operations where you have extremists on behalf of your enemy create terrorist events within the country which will justify a war against an enemy. And also the best reason of course is because it's fun and exciting. The people in the secret police, they're all psychopaths and they enjoy this process. In fact you can make the argument that when the main function of the secret police is to create problems of society so that they can justify their power. All right, so again, this sounds pretty extreme to you, but let's look at some evidence that this was a case in Russia in the late 19th century. All right, so this is Vladimir Lenin and he was a revolutionary who had to escape to Europe in order to not be captured by the secret police, okay? And again, he was a fanatic. So let's read from Wikipedia about his time in London. Lenin's factionalism began to alienate increasing numbers of Bolsheviks, including his former close supporters. So this guy was an asshole. He was a fanatic. He was extreme. He was violent. No one would like this guy. And normally what would happen is he becomes ostracized. He becomes alienated. He is thrown aside and he's left to write his own books, which would happen in a normal course of events. But at this time in history, the secret police intervene. The Ocarina, which is the Russian Imperial Secret Police, exploited his factional attitude by sending a spy, Roman Malanskowski, to act as a vocal, Lenin supporter within the party. Various post-mortemists expressed their suspicions about Malanskowski to Lenin, although it's unclear if the latter was aware of the spy's duplicity. It is possible that he used Malanskowski to feed false information to the Ocarina. Okay, do you understand? The secret police was an active supporter of Vladimir Lenin. Now, the Wikipedia tells us that, okay, well, the Aquinas sent a spy to support Lenin. We can also guess that the secret police were also sending money to Lenin, which is very important, right? Because Lenin can support his faction within the larger socialist movement. In fact, they probably have more money than the other groups, okay? So the secret police is incubating the Bolsheviks. Alright, let's use another example. Have you ever asked yourself where Islamic extremist comes from? So when we did the Islamic Golden Age, what I said, and what I still believe today is Islamist, the Islamic Golden Age was a period of openness and tolerance. So what changed? Well, after World War II, the Americans and the British started to sponsor Islamic extremism. Okay, this is pretty well known historically. Why? There are three main reasons why. The first reason is, at the time in history, the Soviet Union and America was fighting a Cold War. There were no Islamic minorities within America, but guess what? There were lots and lots of Islamic minorities within the Soviet Union. In fact, it was maybe like a third of the population. That's a lot. And they hated the communists because the communists were atheists and they wanted to celebrate their religion. So by sponsoring Islamic extremism, you are destabilizing the Soviet Union. That's the first really good reason. Second reason is at this time, the Middle East is growing in importance because of its oil resource, right? Well, at this time in history, the 50s, 60s, 70s, nationalism, panorism, and socialism are the major ideologies of these nations at this time. And these are all threats to American, British, commercial interests within the Middle East, right? Because all these ideologies are saying, like we shouldn't give our oil for free to America and Britain. We should protect our resource. So by supporting Islamic extremism, you're undermining these ideologies, which is exactly what happened in Iraq. And the last reason is the Americans in the British heavily support the Saudi regime, which is extremely unpopular. So a long time ago, the Saudis made a pact with Wahhabism, which is a fanatical ideology within Islam. And so by supporting Islamic extremism, new support, Wahhabism, which supports the Saudi regime. Okay? So I want you guys to remember this. The Sikkim police throughout history have been supporting bloke extremists in order to achieve short-term political objectives. Okay? All right, let's continue. So after the death of Akshawna II, his son, Akshawna III, comes into power. And he is a reactionary. But he dies fairly young, which leaves his son, Nicholas II to take the throne. And Nicholas II, he's very young and he's very inexperienced. He's a nice guy, he loves his family, but he's not really equipped to lead Russia in a time of tremendous political and social tumult. 1904, the Russians lose a war against the Japanese. And at this time, not only did they lose the war, but there's famine going on throughout Russia. So this is a time of tremendous discontent and revolution in Russia, which leads to something called a Bloody Sunday in 1905, where worker protesters were killed by soldiers. Also at this time, what's happening is that the world family, they start to ally themselves with a priest named Gregory Rasputin. If he looks scary, it's because this is very scary man. He styles himself as a mystic and the world family they have exactly one here to the throne and his name is Alexei, the young son. The problem that Alexei is he has something called hemophilia which means that if he bleeds he could die and resputant was very good at calming down Alexei so resputant became a member of the world family essentially but people, the The Russian people hated Rasputin because there were rumors that he was a sex maniac. He was organizing all these satanic rituals. Also there was a very popular rumor that Rasputin was sleeping with Alexandra, the Zarina. And eventually the nobles were organized and assassinated Rasputin. But not before this entire fear does tremendous damage to the reputation and prestige of the royal family. World War I breaks out, and even though Rasputin pleaded with the Tsar not to intervene, the Tsar did declare war against Germany, and now Russia is up against Germany, the Austrian-Hungary Empire, as well as the Ottoman Empire. And this war is devastating for Russia. And in 1917, there's a huge, spontaneous, protest against the Tsar. And at this point, his generals tell him he should abdicate, which is what he does. And so now the parliament, called the Duma, becomes the provisional government and they clear a republic. All right? But they're still at war with Germany. So what Germany does is it organizes Lenin to be smuggled back into Russia so that he can foment discontent and rebellion and revolution. So Lenin was not just a useful idiot to the Russian secret police, but he was also a useful idiot to the Germans, who wanted to knock Russia out of the war. When Lenin returned to Russia, he tried to organize a rebellion against the Provisional Government, because the Provisional Government still wanted to stay in the war, and Lenin wanted to take Russia out of the war. Lenin called for three things, okay? Land, peace, and bread. And this was very popular among the people. Eventually, the professional government tried to arrest Lenin, he escaped. But then what happened was the military tried to overthrow the government and now the professional government under Kerinsky now requires Lenin to help out and defend the republic against the military. And Lenin is not in any way a politician. He's a theoretician, okay? And he's fanatical. So let's read a passage from his book, State of Revolution, which he wrote at the time of 1917 to understand his thinking. He says, the petty bourgeoisie, Democrats, he's talking about the professional government, though sham socialists, the Mensaviks, who replaced the class struggle by dreams of class harmony, even picture the socialist transformation in a dreamy fashion, not as the overflow of the rule of the exploiting class, but as the peaceful submission of the minority to the majority, which has become aware of its aim. So Lenin has absolutely contempt for all of his enemies, a violent, visual contempt. All right, so in 1917, October, Lenin orders a coup d'etat against the Provisional Government. And this will eventually lead to some call the Russian Civil War. And at this time in history, the Bolsheviks are controlling only some small cities, primarily Petrograd, but their enemy is called the Whites, okay? Though the Whites are former remnants of the Russian Empire, the aristocrats, the military, they control most of Russia, and it seems like they're making a huge advance against the Bolsheviks, okay? But there are three things that will conspire to ensure the Bolsheviks win. The first thing is, the whites don't actually have a policy for reform. They don't have, they want things to stay the way they are. And peasants are hungry, they're landless, they want peace. So they lose the support of the peasants. That's the first problem. Second thing is, the Bolsheviks will enact a reign of terror. They have the secret police called the Cheka, which goes around and kills all enemies of the revolution. All right, so they are fanatically instilling fear and terror among the Russian people. The last reason, the most important reason, is Leon Trotsky. Leon Trotsky organizes the Red Army. And Leon Trotsky is an incredible orator as well as organizer. He is absolutely ruthless. He organizes something called blocking divisions. So the idea is when you go into battle, you're supposed to run ahead. If you change your mind and you run back, some of the backhoe blocker will shoot you to death. So it is brutal, but it works very effectively. Also, Leon Trotsky, we organized the Red Army into a meritocracy. So he doesn't care about your political affiliation. He doesn't care whether or not you're supposed to support the Bolsheviks. if you're capable, you'll be promoted within the Red Army. So he turns the Red Army into a very effective fighting force. And this was what allows the Bolsheviks to eventually triumph. So in many ways, the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution are very similar. So let's go over the similarities. In both, you have a poet. Rejana Uso said freedom is general will. Mark said freedom is classist. Then you have a prophet who leads everyone into a promised land through his peer faith as well as financial. So in the French Revolution, you had Rose Pierre who said reason will set us free. Within the Russian Revolution, you have Lenin who said violence will set us free. And the last thing which we'll focus on in this class is then you have a Messiah figure who comes and conquers the world to ensure the revolution succeeds. In the first revolution Napoleon, right? Who said, I'm the expanding empire, okay? So his theory to ensure the revolution will survive is to expand upwards and conquer Europe, which is what he did. But then you have Stalin, who is I'm the continued revolution. So the way that he maintains the stability and the vitality of the revolution is, like he's constantly purging his enemies, okay? Very much along the lines of the course of revolution in China. All right, so let's look at the similarity between Lenin and Rove's peer. Both are from the low nobility. They're both poets in many ways. And their families faced downward mobility. So Lenin's father was an educator and member of the low nobility. But Lenin's father died when he was young. So Lenin's brother, who Lenin really admired, he was arrested while he was at university for plotting against the empire. And he was executed. But both are idealists. they sought to create justice in a world of injustice. Now, the similarities between Napoleon and Stalin are also really interesting. They're both from marginalized minorities. Napoleon was Corsican, Stalin was Georgian, and they felt persecution and inadequacy. And so they came obsessed with obtaining power to escape their insecurities. So the similarities between these characters are very, very enlightening for us. All right, so now we focus on Stalin. The background of Stalin is this. His father owned a small shoe factory when Stalin was born. But then the father lost the factory and became an abusive alcoholic. Stalin was born poor and he did well in school. He had a very loving Christian mother. He did well in school. But in high school, he came in contact with Marxism and then he dropped out. So the fact that Stalin was a young man who suffered racial discrimination, double mobility, and a college father made him the perfect recruit for three types of organizations, criminal networks, revolutionaries, and the secret police. And guess what, guys? He was part of all three networks. And he was the nexus of these three networks within Georgia. Okay? All right, so this is Stalin and he came from a very poor family and eventually he will rise to the very top. All right, so some Wikipedia background about Stalin, okay? So we won't read all of it, but I wanna point out some certain sentences. Let's look at this sentence. He goes to Batuma and there, his military rhetoric proved divisive among the city's Marxists, some of whom suspected he was an agent provocateur. Here's a spy. His mission was to promote violence and organization within localities. So the secret police can swoop in and arrest everyone. And this makes a lot more sense than a poor man discovers Marxism and then it's totally committed to the cause. It makes more sense that he was recruited as a spy by secret police in order to sow discontent and violence among the Marxists. Let's continue. Stalin began working at the World's South refining storehouse, where he co-organized two worker strikes. After the strike, leaders were arrested. Really important, the moment he organized the strikes, these all these leaders were arrested. He co-organized a mass demonstration, which led to the storming of the prison. Stalin was arrested in April of 1902, and sentenced to three years exile in Siberia, arriving in November 1903. After one failed attempt, Stalin escaped from his exile in January 1904. So throughout this time, he is getting arrested by the secret police, but for the reason, he escapes only after a month. And the benefit of being arrested by the secret police is what? He has credentials now. You can only be a revolutionary if you've been sent to Siberia by the secret police. This is all very suspicious. Okay, let's continue. In 1905, government troops massacred protests. Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke up between Armenians and Azeris and he formed Bolshevik battle squads, which he used to keep the cities, warring ethnic factions apart. So for all the Bolsheviks, okay, because at this point in history Lenin, Trotsky, they're basically writing books. Stalin's the one who's out there organizing people, committing violence, creating organizations. In fact, he's the one funding the Bolsheviks. Okay? Why? Because he assembles his gang, criminal network, which attack black hundreds and raise money through racketeering, counterfeiting, robberies, and kidnapping children of wealthy figures for ransom. He's the mean financier of the Bolshevik Party. Without him, there will be no Bolsheviks. And I would make the argument to you that he's doing this on behalf of the secret police. Right? Because why would you do this? If you're stealing money, why not keep it for yourself and spread it to your friends and bribe the police? Why are you taking all this money and giving it to Lenin? Alright, so ultimately Stalin will triumph. Why? Because Lenin and Trotsky, okay, he's two main competitors were ego maniacs who wanted to be proved right. Okay, they're intellectuals. They're theorists. Stalin just wants power for himself. Okay, so Vladimir Lenin, he is the one pushing for the revolution. He's the theorist, right? And as the Soviets developed power, by the 1920s, he started to have strokes. He's always been in bad health, but now he's really in bad health. And so now he has to figure out who will succeed him, okay? And ultimately he decides the best person to succeed him is Leon Trotsky. Because Leon Trotsky, he's a hero of the revolution. He like Lenin, both believe in an international movement of communism. They both believe that if communism is to survive in the Soviet Union, that it's spread to Europe. And they both believe very strongly that with one push, because of World War I, all of Europe will fall to communism, okay? Stalin disagrees with them though. Stalin believes in maintaining communism within the boundaries of the Soviet Union, okay? And being a nationalist. And ultimately, it is Stalin who will triumph over Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin and create this cult of personality in the Soviet Union. Most people assume that Stalin and Lenin were best friends because really, while Stalin, there'd be no Lenin, right? But you also make the argument about Lenin to be no Stalin, okay? So they were co-dependent on each other. So it was always assumed that they were best friends. But before his death, Lenin wrote a secret memo to the party leaders and he said this, Comrade Stalin, who's now general secretary, so he's head of the organization department of the Communist Party, which is a very important position. How many of you come, Secretary General, has unlimited authority, cartridge in his hands? And I'm not sure whether he will always be capable of using authority with sufficient caution. Stalin's two courts and this defect. What Lenin is saying is this, if you let Stalin continue to amass power, he would become a dictator. Lenin is ahead of the Bolsheviks, but he's not dictator. There's a committee rule, okay? So at this point in history, you would think that, okay, Lenin is now leader and he's gonna make it his mission to ensure Stalin is removed from the general secretary position and Stalin is removed as a possible contender for power within Sovian. But then something happens, which is Lenin has a stroke, convulsions, and he dies. We will never know what really happened. But if you talk to medical practitioners who've looked at this case, they say, look, these convulsions are more indicative of poisoning than they are of a stroke. So there's certain people, and this is not a mainstream view, there's certain people who believe that Salon poisoned Lenin because Lenin was about to remove Stalin from his position of power. Now, he was like, okay, that makes no sense. But at this time in history, there were three individuals that are in the way of Stalin amassing complete power. So Lenin we talked about, but then there's a man named Zakhov Swarovlov, and he was Lenin's right-hand man. In fact, he was the general secretary of the Bolsheviks before Stalin. He was extremely competent. And then at a very young age, okay, only his 30s, he dies of an illness. That's really convenient for Stalin because now Stalin can become head of the organized department of the Bolshevik Party and install all his cronies into position of power. That's really convenient for Stalin. But guess what? 1926, head of the Cheka, Felix Zavinsky, okay? had the secret police. He dies as well under mysterious circumstances. He has a heart attack and he's also really young. And remember the secret police is where the center of power in government is. And after he dies, Stalin is now able to implant his cronies, his law of subordinates into the secret police. Okay? So all this is like really convenient for Stalin even though we we have no evidence that he, in fact, poised all three. It's just really convenient for him. All right? This is really weird how this really worked out for him. We'll never know why, okay? But you have to be suspicious. Okay? Either he's the luckiest man ever in the world or he basically just killed everyone in order to amass power. And in fact, he continues this. In 19, from 1936 to 1938, there's something called the Great Purge, which is continued revolution. At this point in history, what Selim will do is kill at least one million party members. He destroys the old guard. And he does so by having the secret police purchase the army and the bureaucracy, and then secret units within the secret police purchase those guys, and then new units purchase those secret units, okay, and so on. All right? There are the show trials where the Bolshevik leaders, the old guard, they confess to being traitors to the regime. They confess to being secret capitalists. All right, so let's look at the parts of the Red Army. This is from Wikipedia. The parts of the Red Army and military maritime fleet removed three or five marshals, 13 of 15 army commanders, eight of nine admirals, 50 of 57 army corps commanders, 154 of 106 division commanders. So what he did was he completely wiped out the entire leadership of the Soviet military. And actually this piece of fact is what sort of convinced the German student in 1941 because they're like, well, you know, selling killed of all the experienced officers and so let's attack them because they won't know what to do. Okay, but in fact, you can make the argument and I think a lot of people have made the argument that this will ultimately be beneficial to the war effort in World War II. Why? Because you've removed all the dead weight. You've removed the conservative generals who are not experienced with innovative warfare. So by doing this, what Salah did was make the Soviet military more innovative and more open and more flexible. And so I know this is a hard idea to understand. Let's just do a thought experiment to understand this idea. Let's say there's 100 of you students and you're shipped off to a desert island and you're forced to survive by yourself. Well, I mean, maybe in the beginning you would struggle, right? You fight, but eventually I think over a couple of weeks you would learn to get along and you would learn to survive on this desert island, okay? That's what I think would happen. I don't know, but I hope that's what happens. Now let's imagine 20 teachers go with you guys. I'm pretty sure you're worse off, okay? those 20 teachers would be more intent on maintaining a hierarchy of things than to actually solving a problem. And so you can make the argument that by purging the army in the late 30s, Stalin made the Red Army more innovative and better prepared for German invasion in 1941. All right? Now, the show trials, basically all the leading Bolsheviks, anyone who could have possibly challenged Stalin were arrested and they confessed to being criminals, to being traitors, to being spies. All right, and all of them were, of course, innocent. These are loyal Bolsheviks who sacrificed their entire lives, their families, in order to ensure the revolution would succeed. So why did they confess? Well, this is Arthur Kessler, and he wrote a book called Darkness at Noon, which is really one of the best books ever written. Just brilliant. And in it, he profiles an old Bolshevik leader, And he tries to go into the mind of this person as he is about to be executed. And he's remembering his life where for the revolution, he killed everyone basically. He sacrificed everyone. He betrayed everyone. He is guilty as sin. But the moment that he's about to execute it, he confesses to everything. And the argument here is, if you spend your entire life doing bad things, You're not going to admit this is all for nothing, right? He's going to do everything possible to save the revolution. If that meant killing himself in order to save the revolution, he would do so. So think of the original sin, right? The original sin of the revolution is all this violence committed against civilians. Well, now the sports week, he is like Jesus who is sacrificed, he will cleanse the people of their sins and allow for the revolution to continue. All right? What was brilliant about this is, Stalin put these people on trial and he knew that ultimately they would confess. And this would cement his power. All right, so let's summarize what we've discussed and think about how Stalin wanted all, okay? So there are five reasons. Okay, the first reason is, from an early age, he wanna trust the powerful patrons. Criminal, like mafia bosses, secret police heads, revolutionaries, right? And then he was absolutely loyal to them until it was no more expedient. What's amazing about Stalin is, he made everyone believe that he was loyal to them personally and absolutely, okay? That was his absolute power. Second is, he always was able to identify, capable of subordinates, and he promote them selflessly, okay? So that's really important. Third reason is, he understands Silence can be more powerful than great speech making. Do not become too wedded to ideas and positions and let others despise you. So, Lamar and Lenin and Leon Trotsky were tremendous orators. They were brilliant. The problem though is that by making these speeches, it increases their hubris, it increases their ego, and it makes them more wedded to ideas. Silent refused to give speeches. So you can never understand, you can never know how Stalin thought about things. Now it's his secret weapon. Also, no one took him seriously. At this point in history, everyone thought Stalin was an intellectual lightweight. Because at this point, the Bolsheviks thought that whoever had the best theories were the most righteous leaders. And Stalin didn't have any ideas of his own. Shuzhik retreats are most effective in times of internal conflict. So disappearing, hiding, offends no one, and offers no risk. So another way of saying this is that secret police always to arrest Stalin at a time of tremendous conflict within the socialist movement. So the split between Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, Stalin wasn't there, he was arrested. So that's really convenient for Stalin. And then last is, let your enemies destroy themselves, except who they are and help them become their worst selves. So Trotsky lost out because Trotsky was a tremendous egomaniac, he pissed everyone off. And Stalin encouraged that. So, just let your enemies destroy themselves. And this is what he will do with Hitler as well. And that's how he won World War II. Okay? All right, so let's take a short break and then we'll come back and do World War II. So there's no way we can understand how Stalin was able to defeat the Bolshevik leadership. And so, very simple formulation. Lenin, Trotsky, were all priests. Okay? Stalin was a spy. And so, let's look at the differences. Priests have favoring conviction. You're trying to bring God to the world. Whereas, a spy has multiple personalities. So, Stalin could be a different person and a different, two different people. In fact, no one really thought Stalin was a serious threat. And no one really took Stalin seriously. Second is, the priest doesn't call analytical intelligence. That's why they're able to write books. That's why they're able to give great speeches. A spy has emotional intelligence. A spy is able to make you trust him. The last is, priests are concerned with the pursuit of truth in God. Spies only want power. So if you think about this way, if you look at this formulation, then the Bolsheviks didn't even have a chance against Stalin. So now let's go on to World War II. And there's tremendous debate as to what happened in World War II. It was a calic-calicismic struggle between the Soviet Union and the Germans, okay? Tens of millions of people died in this war. It was a tragedy. So there's always going to be debate as to what happened. Why did the Germans lose? All right, so let me give you my interpretation. Basically what happened was this. The Germans had a certain doctrine of war, a certain belief system going into the war. And they executed this belief system, this plan perfectly in a blitzkrieg, okay? But when the doctrine of war failed, they couldn't adapt. So the German doctrine of war is called blitzkrieg. And the idea of blitzkrieg is you very quickly cut off the head and the body collapses. You basically go in and you destroy the command control center of the military. That's what happened throughout Europe in the late 30s, right? That's what happened to France. In only a few weeks, Germany was able to cut off the command center of the French military and cause the French military to collapse. But the problem with the Soviet Union is that it's huge and there's really no command control center. So what was happening was even the Germans were destroying the Soviets, they were running around Russia, pointlessly, for many, many months. They really didn't have a plan because the plan was always to destroy the head of a snake. But if you can't find the head, you're gonna run around innocently. The Soviets are really good at fighting a war of treason, right? Something called Scorch Earth Policy, which is how they defeated Charles II of Sweden, as well as the Poldian of France before. And that's how they also defeated the Germans. The Germans are known for their organizational supremacy, okay? But they're not known for the battle for the flexibility. The Soviets, even though they were losing many battles in the beginning of the war, they eventually adapted themselves to German warfare and eventually they were able to overwhelm the Germans. And I think a lot of this flexibility had to do with the fact that they lost a lot of their major leadership in the purges. So now we're seeing this is the difference between the Germans and the Russians is Hitler did not purge his military. Stalin did purge his military. And that's why the Soviets were much more innovative than the Germans in the war. Also, the Germans were fighting for something called Liban's Rom. Liban's Rom means living space in German. It's basically like if we are to survive as a German people, as a German nation, we need more resources, we need more land. And so we need Ukraine, okay? Especially for the oil. But the Soviets were fighting for their motherland, mother Russia. So they were much more motivated to fight than the Germans. Now, so look at this map. You'll see two things, okay? The first thing is the Germans were really spread out throughout the front. That allows for encirclement, okay? That allows for the Soviets to attack them from different angles and encirclement. That's the first thing. Second thing is you also notice that the Germans didn't get that far in this war. They at most got to the outskirts of Moscow, but not beyond. And the Soviet Union, if you look at the map, it is huge. Okay? All right. So this was one of, this was the deadest war in human history. The Germans sent in almost four million personnel and they overwhelm the Soviets in the beginning, but it was not enough, okay? Four million men was not enough to conquer the Soviet Union. You needed 40 million, and the Germans didn't have that. All right, so what's the big deal? So the Soviets had unlimited resources, they defeated the Germans. This is a big deal because, let's go back to the year in 1935. In the year 1935, if we were to have this class and we were to discuss what will happen 10 years from now, we could probably guess that the Soviet Union would collapse. Why? Because Stalin was perching all the major leadership of the Soviet Union, creating a lot of discontent, a lot of civil conflict. As well, if you look at a map of the world in 1935, most of the world was capitalist. Japan, which controlled the East, was capitalist. Then you had the Germans, the Nazis rising. You had the English. Then you had the Americans. And all four of these nations were under threat from communism. They were common subversive in all these countries, and they were considered a major threat. In fact, in the 1930s, there's a real threat that in America, there would be a communist rebellion. In Germany, there's a failed communist revolution. In France and England, the communists were everywhere. So these four nations, Japan, the Americans, the English, the Germans, they all see communism as a major threat to them. So we could imagine that they would unite against Soviet Union at some point to destroy communism once and for all, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is that at this point in history, race science is very popular. Eugenics is very popular. And guess what? The Americans, the British, and the Germans, all of them saw themselves as one people. The Nordic people, the Aryan race. In fact, Hitler was a tremendous admirer of the English people. They saw the English as brave, as brilliant, as the master race. Okay, so you can make the argument that the Nordic people would eventually unite together to destroy the Slavs, which was a major threat to them in Europe. And the third major reason is at this time as Germany is industrializing, the Americans are helping Hitler industrialize. Okay, this is from ChatGBT. American industrialists invested heavily in Nazi Germany particularly before and during World War II. Okay, this is important. Major companies like General Motors, IT&T, Eastman Kodak, Senate Oil and others had substantial assets and investment in German subsidiaries. So these American companies, the major American companies of the time was helping Hitler to industrialize his war machine. All right, so given all this, you could imagine that America would eventually come to support Germany in a conflict with the Soviet Union. So at this point in history, the Soviet Union, it was unlikely the Soviet Union would survive, okay? But then in 1941, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa. Now, this is one of the greatest mysteries among historians. The mystery is this. Hitler had to organize four million soldiers, multinational force to invade the Soviet Union. Spies, the Americans, the British told Stalin, listen, Hitler's going to invade you. Stalin refused to believe them. Stalin said, listen, first of all I have a non-aggression pact with Hitler. We're friends! He's going to invade me, number one. Number two is Hitler's being being blockaded by the British. We the Soviet Union are providing all these resources, oil, food to the Germans. Why would they invade us? It's suicidal. And third of all, Germany doesn't have the resources to invade us. Okay, so Stalin refused to believe that the Germans would invade. He believed it was a British and a first British plot to undermine the friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union. Also, there were some German soldiers who were sympathizers to communism. They would run away and go to the Soviets and tell them, listen, I have all these secret plans of this invasion called Operation Barbarossa. They're gonna come, the Germans are coming. Be ready. And what the Soviets do? They shot them to death for being spies. Okay? So the Germans invade and the Soviets aren't prepared. Not only that, but Stalin seems to be purposefully sabotaging the Soviet war effort. As the Germans are advancing, the Soviets should push back, okay? But some orders, the army should stay where they are so they get encircled by the Germans. And at this point, the Germans have more prisoners of war than they could possibly imagine. Millions and millions of Soviets captured in the first months of the war. It is a complete disaster for the Soviet Union. And so everyone's like, Stalin has gone out of his mind. First of all, why wasn't he ready for Hitler's invasion? He refused to believe that Hitler would invade. Second of all, why didn't he give his generals authority to run the war in a way that should have been run? Why did Stalin interfere and destroy the Soviet Army in the first few months? These are the two major mysteries of Operation Barbarossa. Okay, I know this is going to be controversial, okay? But I'm going to make you this argument. Stalin purposely did both things. Stalin purposely let Hitler invade, and Stalin purposely let millions of soldiers be captured by the Nazis. And you're like, that's insane! Well, guess what happens? At this point, because the Nazis are destroying the Soviet Union, The Americans come in on behalf of the Soviet Union. Remember, at this point in history, the Americans think they're gonna go to war against the Soviet Union. The Americans wanna ally with Germany. But because the Germans are about to destroy the Soviet Union, the Americans can't let this happen. If Germany destroys the Soviet Union, Germany, the German science, technology, and organization would have access to Soviet manpower, oil, and food. Germany would be invincible. So the Americans stepped in, but look, let's look at what the American contribution to the war is. In total, US deliveries to the US are a full land lease amount to 11 billion, equivalent to $150 billion. Over 400,000 jeeps and trucks, 12,000 armored vehicles, 7,000 tanks, 14,000 aircraft, 1.75 million tons of food. The Americans basically industrialized the Soviet Union, giving the Soviet Union unlimited resources, unlimited technology. Why? Because they're afraid of a German conquest. All right. From Wikipedia, roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR. So Americans gave about 17.5 million tons of equipment to the Russians. But guess what? When the Americans entered the war, they used a total of 22 million tons. That's incredible. The American army used the same amount of supplies that they gave to the Soviets. That's incredible to think about. Yeah, there are millions of soldiers captured by the Germans, okay, and it's a travesty what happens to them because most of them will starve to death. They starve to death not because the Nazis are barbarians, but because the Nazis had a doctrine of war that would go in and after three months the Soviet Union would Now they're stuck with these millions of soldiers. Now they're in trouble because they can't actually deal with all these soldiers and they don't have enough food and supplies to continue the war. So these prisoners of war are a huge problem for the Nazi war machine. And because a lot of these soldiers are dying in prisoner camps, guess what? It motivates the Russians to fight to the bitter end. What were two depths? The Soviet Union lost anywhere between 26 to 27 million people. It is the greatest tragedy to follow a nation in human history. One of the greatest tragedies. But okay, that is true. But let's look at something called Game Theory Counterfactual. Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you different possibilities different outcomes. Okay, so let's just say So everyone knows Soviet Union and Germany is gonna go to what some point Okay, it's entirely obvious to everyone But and there are four possibilities the first possibility is the Soviet Union invades Germany and Threatens Berlin. Okay What happens here? Well, I guarantee you the Americans come in on behalf of Germany The Americans send the military to defend Germany because they cannot afford for Europe to turn communist Okay, so in this situation guess what Stalin loses the war the Soviet Union is destroyed and since in a one So no to the Soviet Union invades Germany and is stopped at the border by the German war machine Guess what? Americans still come in because I kind of afford for Germany to lose this war against the Soviet Union Okay, they were gonna still come in silent loses so no to no three Germany invades Soviet Union and is stopped at the border and this is scenario the Americans are locking their heads off, right? because fine, fight it out, we don't care, okay? And the Americans are probably gonna sell supplies to both the Germans and the Soviet Union, all right? To destroy both, and they eventually come in to destroy both Germany and Soviet Union. So in all three situations, the Soviet Union loses. There's only one situation in which the Soviet Union wins. Germany invades the Soviet Union and threatens Moscow. Okay? This is the only situation. There are 10,000 different scenarios. There's only one scenario in which Stalin wins the war and he found it and he implemented it, okay? But it required a sacrifice of 27 million Soviet people, soldiers and civilians. Only in this situation does Soviet Union win World War II. Only in this situation. In every other situation, every other thing that Stalin does, he loses the war, because the Americans will come in on behalf of Germany. And of course, this war is fundamental and it changes the course of history Because without this war, without Stalin winning, there'd be no Mao Zedong. There'd be no Communist China. There'd be no New China. There'd be no today's China. Okay? You have to understand this. Communism was not inevitable. It did not have to happen. In fact, you can make the argument that in the 1940s, it was going to get destroyed by the capitalists. It was only because Stalin won World War II that China was able to turn communist. Okay? So Stalin changed the course of human history. None of these things should have happened. made them happen. And of course, we today have Vladimir Putin. And Vladimir Putin, I will argue to you, is also going to change the course of human history. And this is something I will argue to you next class. So Stalin was the uber months of the 20th century. I will argue to you next class that Putin is really the uber months of the 21st century. He sees where history is going and he He controls history to his benefit. He's gonna warp reality to the benefit of Russia. Okay? All right. So we have four great questions about today's lecture. The first question is, how do the Americans feel about communism and fascism? Second question is, the Americans and the British were very close allies. And we know this through Len Lee's, right? where the Americans are shipping billions of supplies to Britain for the war effort. So why did the British hate the Germans so much? And the third question is, what was the sound strategy via the Americans? And the last question is, in the first few months, the Soviets were gonna destroy. So what was Stalin's response and what did he promise the people to get them to fight to the bitter end. Okay, great questions, okay. So let's go over them one by one. Americans at this time in history, 1930s, the elite, they were heavy Nazi sympathizers. There was an American named Charles Lindbergh and he founded something called the America First Party. And he was very popular and there's a very good chance that he would have won the elections in America. So American isolation is the major dominant local trend and it was only when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor that the Americans entered World War II. If the Japanese didn't attack Pearl Harbor it would have been almost impossible to convince the American people to enter into the war. So the Americans were either, well I'm talking about the elite, they were either neutral, like we don't care where isolation or pro-Nazi, okay? So that was just the general attitude of the Americans in 1930s. Communism was a real threat to America, so communism, anarchism were real threats to the American political system in the 1930s, especially with the Great Depression, okay? So does that answer your question? Great, okay, question number two. So why were the British so intent on destroying the Germans? In fact, you guys don't know this, but Hitler made numerous peace overtures to the British, especially within Churchill. And again, the Germans had tremendous respect for the British. I mean, like it's basically the same people, right? So why was Churchill so intent on destroying Germany? Germany. So there are different historical arguments. One argument is, Churchill just hated Hitler. Like personally, he had a visual dislike of Hitler. Okay, that's number one. Number two is, the Germans embarrassed the British in the war, right? Because the British had this expeditionary force against the Germans and the Germans wiped them out. The British were forced to retreat at Dunkirk. I think for me the best reason is just geopolitical. So let me explain what I mean by this. So this is something called a MacKender thesis. This was developed after World War I. The idea is this, Britain is a naval power. And as long as it's able to dominate the seas, it controls the world. Because at this time in history, most people are training through sea. So Britain, as long as Britain is able to control the waterways, it controls the world. But there's a problem here. The problem is, let's just say that a power arises within the heartland, okay? And it could be Germany, and it could be Russia, okay? But it's gonna be one of these two. And if they're able to unite or conk each other, then they unite the entire European Asian continent. in which case, all they do is build railways. And then Britain ceases to exist as an empire. Okay? So the great threat is a great power emerging within Europe, Asia to unite the entire heartland. And the British believed this, but also the Americans believed this as well. Right? Because Americans would eventually inherit the British empire. And so at this point in history, Germany was conquering all of Europe and it was about to conquer Russia. So Britain's geopolitical interests was to ensure that Germany would be hindered, okay? So I know in the history books that you're taught that World War II was a great conflict between Britain and Germany for democracy and human freedom. That's nonsense, okay? World War II was fought primarily between Germany and Russia. three-fourths of German forces were directed at Russia. Most casualties were happening between Germany and Russia. What Ferdinand was doing that was vital was blockading Germany. And as Germany was running out of food and fuel, it had no choice between the Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, in order to access the resources of Russia, okay? So this idea that the British in the Germans always had to fight. I mean, it's something that became mythology after World War II. During World War II, Hitler wanted peace. Britain wanted to ensure Germany could not expand to the east and create the heartland. Okay, so that's what was driving British interest at this time. Does that make sense? All right, does that make sense to you guys? All right. Let's go to the third question. Stalin's strategy for the Americans. Okay, so what Stalin's able to do that's different from everyone else is, you know, if you're Churchill, you're thinking in terms of Europe. If you are Hitler, you're thinking in terms of like Europe, right? They're all Eurocentric. What Stalin was able to do that made him different was, he was able to see the world as it is, okay? He was able to see the Americans. He knew the Americans would eventually come into the war. He was able to see Japan, okay? And the reason why is, at this time, communism is an international movement. So it spies everywhere. So he was able, he basically had the best intelligence in the world. So he was able to figure out exactly how these pieces were gonna move about. So for him, it was like, okay, I go conquer Germany, but then the Americans come in and the Americans to Soyuz, okay? So the main problem were the Americans, Because the Americans at this point, remember, had the greatest industrial capacity in the world. Whichever side the American support would win the war. All right, so Stalin had to figure out a way to neutralize the Americans. And the best way to neutralize the Americans is, let's be friends, right? Because America's a democracy. If Roosevelt is saying, Uncle Joe is our friend, right? And he has all these photos in the press of Stalin and Roosevelt shaking hands, having these conferences, then the Americans cannot go around and backstab the Soviet Union. And guess what? After World War II ended, after the Germans were defeated, handily by the Allies, there were many Americans, especially General Patton, who was one of the main generals in World War II. He recognized that oops, we made a mistake. The real enemy are not the Germans, the real enemy are the Russians. And this would eventually give us the Cold War. So it was after World War II the Americans realized we were duped. We should not have come into this war on behalf of the Soviet Union. We should have stayed neutral, or we should have supported Germany to maintain balance of power. So Stalin just tricked everyone. That's why I say he's the overmatch. It should not have happened this way. If you just think about logically what each party, what each play of the game should have done, then the Soviet Union should have collapsed. So Stalin was able to trick Hitler. He convinced Hitler to invade him. He tricked Roosevelt. Roosevelt became his supporter. He even tricked Churchill. So I mean, I know this is not what you're taught in history class usually, but just look at it like just analytically, using game theory analysis. Then you have to conclude that Stalin was the only one who saw the world globally and was able to manipulate people to his benefit. And that's what's happening. By the way, this is what's happening today with Putin. Putin is the only one who's able to think globally. And he's the only one able to think strategically. Everyone else, like Trump, he's only responding to domestic issues. Does that make sense? All right, let's move on to the last question. Stalin, what did he promise the Soviet people? He didn't promise anything. He was God, okay? Do you understand this? He could do what he did because he was God. Any other leader who pulled this crap would have been arrested and executed for incompetence. Only Stalin, who because of the great Purge, consolidated power only in his hands. His authority was unquestionable, right? He had spies spying on spies and he had other spies spying on these spies, okay? So he created this like divide and conquer system within the Soviet Union which made his power absolute. In fact, you can make an argument that he was the most powerful person ever in human history because no one could question his authority. So he could afford to do this. He could afford to make mistakes and look like a buffoon because no one could challenge him. Does that make sense? And ultimately, the Soviet people rallied around him because they didn't want to be called by the Germans. They wanted to save their nation. And Stalin knew this. Okay, this is very famous quotation attributed to sound. It's not true, he actually didn't say this. But he could have said this. He said, one million people died in the Gulags, that's a statistic, no one cares. One man gets run over by a tractor, that's a national tragedy. So he understands intimately how people think. He understands psychology of both individuals and of nations. And that says he's able to manipulate people, control people to his will. All right? And it was able to create a certain market to be used among the population that were otherwise kind of divided by the ideal. OK, so that's a great point. Thank you. So his major contribution to theory, communist theory, is the idea of nationalism. Because what made him different from Trotsky and Lenin was, he was only concerned about the Soviet Union. He wanted to maintain the integrity of the Soviet Union, whereas Trotsky and Lenin were concerned about international communism. They saw the Soviet Union as the little brother in the movement. Germany would be the big brother because Germany had the most Poleteria. It was the most urbanized, and maybe the French as well. But the Soviet Union would be the little brother to the Germans. When the Germans eventually rebelled and established the communism. Okay, so Lenin and Trotsky were fundamentally in nationalism, whereas Stalin understood, people don't want that crap, okay? People want to feel part of the community. People want to feel part of a place. And so he heavily promoted nationalism, which galvanized the people, as Doug says, into making tremendous sacrifices during World War II. So people die, not for ideas, people die for each other. And that's what Stalin understood fundamentally, okay? So yeah, Mother Russia was his promise to the people. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Okay, great. So next class, Thursday, the grand finale to the course. We've done the entire human history from the Ice Age when we were just living in caves. On Thursday, we'll finish the course with the grand finale, which is the American Empire, Trump and the American Empire. So hopefully that will be the best class of this year. Let's end with the best class."}

I want to paint you a picture of the world in about 1200 BC. Okay, Malcolm. So in this world, the center of this world is what we call Mycenaean Greece. Okay? Across from the Mycenaean Greece, across the Aegean Sea, okay, this is the Aegean, is what we call Anatolia. Today we refer to Anatolia as Turkey. And in Anatolia, the Hittite Empire rules Anatolia. Further south is a place called Canine. Canine is important when we do the Bible because that is the birthplace of the Israelites. So, Canaan today is what we refer to as Lebanon, Syria, and Israel today. Canaan is a province of the Egyptian Empire, okay? So this is Egypt, okay? Over here is a place called Mesopotamia, and we today call Mesopotamia Iraq, okay? Over here is today what we call Iran. Back then it was basically Persia. Over here is Afghanistan. And the next to Afghanistan is India. And of course, remember these are the steps, okay? So from Masonin Greece, you also had the Mediterranean. And over here are the islands of Cyprus and Crete. And then over here is a place called Iberia. And over here is Britain. So this is a map of the world in 1200 BC. And what's really important for you to recognize about this world is it's interconnected. Meaning that they are trading and communicating with each other. This is what we call the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age. And why is it called the Bronze Age? Because they're trading basically bronze during this period. Back then, bronze is like oil today. It is the basis for the economy, the very structure of their economy. Bronze is an alloy made of copper and tin. Copper and tin you have to mine, okay? And only a few places will have these resources. So tin is found in Britain, in Iberia, in Anatolia, in Afghanistan, okay? Copper is mainly found in Cyprus and Crete, and also in Anatolia, okay? Now, meaning and what this means is in order to make bronze, you basically have to trade with the entire world. Okay? So India, this world, the trading would go as far as from India to Britain. Even China over here was part of this world, but not to the degree as these other places. Okay? In this world, there are different ways that you can profit or make money. The first way is mining. So basically extracting resources, tin and copper in order to make bronze. Second way is industry manufacturing. So turning, so making bronze from tin and copper, and then turning bronze into weapons, into pottery to be sold elsewhere. The third way you can make money is by what? Trading, right? So in this world, if you look at this map, who basically profit the most from trading? If you look at this map, who would make the most money from trading? This area, right? Does that make sense? It means it is the center of the world. You have to pass through this world in order to access everywhere else, okay? And this place over here, you look at the map, it becomes the center of the world. Because this place becomes the logistic hub of the world. To get to anywhere, you have to pass through this place. And so this place can basically collect tolls. This place is called what? You guys know? To me? Yeah, it's the toll gate of the world. You have to pass through this place in order to access other places. Therefore, this place is very wealthy. This place, can you guess what this place is called? You guys, can you guys guess? Troy. Have you guys heard of the Trojan War? Okay, we will do the Iliad next semester. We will discuss the Iliad in this class. But I want you to understand this place is called Troy. And because this place is so important, for centuries they've been fighting wars over this place. because it's really the center of the universe, right? If you can control this place, you become very wealthy because everyone has passed through you, you can collect tolls, you can trade, okay? Does that make sense? And the last way you can make money off this world is what? What's the last way in which you can make a lot of money in this world? You can do it through mining, industry, trading. What else can you do to make money? Piracy, right? Does that make sense? Steel, right? Piracy, right? So when we read the Iliad, what you will discover is the Greeks who attacked Troy, they were basically pirates. Troy made a lot of money off trading and pirates went to steal a lot of their resources and well, okay, doesn't make sense? So the main point is that this world was interconnected. It was a globalized world. called as globalization. But at the same time, it was very chaotic. It was very dynamic. They traded with each other, but they also fought wars against each other. Does that make sense? And these places in the center of the universe, my city in Greece, became very wealthy because they traded and they engaged in piracy. The high-tides became very wealthy. Egypt became very wealthy because they were the center of the universe. But a couple of decades later, this entire world collapsed. This world disappeared, meaning that machining in Greece was destroyed. It was completely burned down and they lost about a quarter of their population. Okay. The Haitham Empire destroyed. And even though Canine disappeared and even though Egypt was not destroyed, It ceased to be a hegemon. It ceased to be a global power. And a few decades later, they were conquered by outside powers. Okay? After 1200 BCE, Egypt ceased to be a power. So this is what we call the Bronze Age collapse. And for the decades, scholars have been trying to figure out what happened. Why is it that in 1200 BCE, this world was wolf-y, it was interconnected, and then a few decades later, it all disappeared, it collapsed. And that's a great mystery that no one has been able to solve. So let me tell you what we know. We know that what caused this collapse are what we call the sea peoples. And we know because Egypt has written records of battling the Sea Peoples. So basically, over the course of a few decades, people were coming in from the West and attacking Egypt. This was not one people. This was a series of different peoples attacking Egypt from the Sea. And Egypt had to spend decades in order to repulse the Sea Peoples. What we know is the Sea Peoples, whoever they were, they didn't destroy Egypt, but they did, they didn't destroy the Hittites and they did destroy the Mycenaean Grease, okay? So, and what we figure, what we know is the Sea Peoples, they were basically a combination of pirates and also refugees. These people attacked Egypt because Egypt was the bread basket of the world. That's where all the food was. So they were attacking Egypt for the food. These are people who are hungry. They joined with pirate ships. They were trying to take over Egypt together. They destroyed Muslim in Greece. They destroyed the Hittites. And they failed to destroy Greece. They were stopped in Egypt. So another question then is, what's driving this population movement from West to East? That's a great mystery. And over the past few decades, different solutions, different ideas have been proposed. Before, we thought that it must have been an invasion. So the idea is that what's happening is you had people from the north of Europe invade Macedonia and Greece, which drove them westward. That's the first idea that we had, but we have not found any evidence to this, we have not found any evidence this is the case, okay? So even though this was one of the first theories, there's actually no evidence to support this. Second theory that we had is basically a natural disaster. So the idea is maybe there was a volcano explosion somewhere, okay? And this caused the weather to change. And now farmers can no longer feed themselves so they can start to move westwards and attack Egypt. That's a second theory. And there's more evidence for this. But the theory that we have today is a perfect storm, or a systems collapse. And the idea here is that it was not one thing in one year that caused the system to collapse. it was a series of events over decades. And these three major events are natural disasters, or so basically earthquakes. So we have archaeological evidence that there was a series of earthquakes in this region at this time, which destabilized the region. So earthquakes happened. We also have evidence of climate change. So the weather became cooler over the course this period which meant it was harder to grow crops. Okay? And we also have evidence of eternal revolt. Okay? Meaning that people rebelled against the elite over food kings and there was a lot of war and violence. Okay? So the theory that we have today is what caused the branch age collapse was a perfect storm. Basically, a multiple factors which led to systems collapse. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions so far? Any questions so far? Are we clear? Alright. So one thing that you have made notice in this class is that I have a very different understanding of history than other people. So I happen to disagree with this theory of the Perkstorm even though it is the scholarly consensus. So I want to explain to you today my theory of what happened. All right, so the first thing you need to understand is this system collapsed even though it was traumatic for Europe, it is not unique in human history. This sort of stuff has happened before, okay? So if we go over here to North America, to the Mayas, okay, so the Maya civilization existed in Central America, okay, Guatemala basically. And so we find some of the pattern where, in about 200 AD, in the year 200, their civilization started to explode. It started to increase. It reached its peak in about 900 AD. In the year 900, its civilization was over the place in Central America. But then after 900, it went all the way down. So about 30 years time, by 1200, they're basically their entire civilization almost collapsed. So it's a very similar pattern to what's happening in the Bronze Age. So the question then is, why does this happen? And so to understand this, I am going to present you with a new theory that we will use a lot in this class. So I want you to understand this theory, okay? But it comes from a historian by the name of Peter Turchin. Peter Turchin, who's a historian. He's American, but he came from Russia. He's basically Russian-American. And he has a theory called elite overproduction. And elite overproduction, the theory is very interesting because it's arguing against the way we traditionally understand why societies collapse. So the way we usually understand why societies collapse is we get from Karl Marx. And basically what Karl Marx says is eventually your society collapses because the people revolt. So basically people rebellion. So in other words, Karl Marx believes that society collapses because it is a bottom-up process. It's a bottom-up process. If you treat workers badly, they will stop working. If you force them to work, they will go on strike. If you force them to work again, they will fight against you. They will rebel. A worker revolution. That's what Karl Marx argues. And Peter Turchin says, OK, that's a really interesting theory. But if you look at the historical data, if you look at the evidence, the problem isn't the bottom. If you look at what's collapsed, it's not because of the people rebelling. It's because there's infighting among the elite. So there's civil war among the elite. Does that make sense? That's his theory. If the problem of society isn't that there's too many the poor people, the problem is there are too many rich people. That's the real problem. And that's why society has collapsed. So let me explain to you this theory slowly. Elite overproduction. So in this world of 12-minute BCE, we have something called a permanent heritatory elite. Permanent heritatory elite permanent just means they're always there, okay? Heritatory means they pass on their status and their privilege and their wealth to the children and This is new in human history because before there was an elite But they were not permanent meaning they could be changed over time and they didn't pass their privileges on to their Children everyone have to earn their privilege and power So the elite was constantly shifting in society. But now in about the year 1200 BC, you had a permanent, heritory elite. When you have that, you have three advantages. What the elite gives society are three major advantages. The first major advantage is the idea of organization. Organization right basically think of the elite as your brain of Society's brain they can help ornate resources. Okay, that's good for War if any enemy you need an elite to lead you into battle. Okay, it's also good for public works Okay, so think of the pyramids in Egypt in the Great Wall of China, right you need an elite to to organize your resources in order to create public works that benefit all society. So the main thing here would be irrigation, right? So you need an elite in order to have irrigation. So that's the first major benefit of having a permanent, heritory elite. Second major advantage is, because you have better organization, you have more wealth. becomes wealthier if you have a permanent elite. People work harder. Okay? And even though there's more inequality, inequality also forces people to work harder. Does that make sense? Okay? And because you have these two things, organization and wealth, you also have scale. And what scale basically means is your population now can move up. Before in the Egotarian society, when you didn't have a permanent elite, at most society could reach about 10,000 people. But now when you have a permanent elite, you can reach about a million people. So now you can scale up. So these are three major advantages to having an elite. But there's a problem with having an elite. And the problem is they engage in something called rent-seeking behavior. I want you guys to remember this term rent-seeking behavior, which is very important for our class. So what does this mean? It means basically, to think of a landlord, right? A landlord doesn't really do anything, but a landlord has land that he can rent to you, the farmer, In exchange, you give me a share of your crops. So I don't do anything, but because I have land, I can rent it out to you. It turns out the elite mainly make their money through rent-seeking behavior. So let me give you another example of rent-seeking behavior. All of you want to go to university, right? Why do you want to go to university? What's your purpose? What's your purpose in going to university? honest. It's to get the degree right? Okay? The degree. Okay? And the degree is your ticket to success in society. Okay? You believe that you go to university, you are getting a ticket, the degree in order to access social mobility. Okay? To access wealth in society. In other words, the universities are charging you rent. Okay? So the degree is basically rent. Doesn't make sense. Now, some of you may say, wait, that's wrong because I'm going to university to learn. It's about learning. Well, guess what? When you actually go to university, you're going to discover they don't actually teach you that much. They don't have to teach you that much. And the reason why is you're stuck paying the rent. You need to degree, right? You don't have to actually teach you anything. You have to come to class anyway. Doesn't make sense? The same thing for the school, where in order to get to university, you have to go through this high school. So you're here paying tuition, and you're paying rent. Does that make sense? You're not here in the school to learn. You're here in school to get to the degree so you can access university and get that degree. And all this process, all you're doing is paying rent. So if you have a school, you can charge for rent. Just as if you're landlord, you can charge people rent for renting your room or real estate property. Okay, does that make sense? This is what we call rent-sicking behavior. Now, you're like, okay, well, this kind of sucks. Okay? And it does suck. But what keeps the system together is the idea of a social contract. Okay? Basically, the idea of a social contract is, yes, we delete, we know we are charging you rent, And we know this sucks for you, the people, but we have a contract. So as the elite, I'm obligated to help society. So the way they help society is by giving back to society. So what the elite do throughout society in the past is they organize public feasts and also public temples. So in today's society, like the parks or schools, they're built by the government, right? But back then, they didn't have a government that the elites who were responsible for building temples, for holding public feasts. So this idea of a social contract. And the reason why you need a social contract is because if you don't have a social contract and you just charge rent, people will leave. Does that make sense? So in this world, it's very chaotic, but there are different places, there are different social organizations you can go to. So if you are in Egypt, and you don't really like Egypt, guess what? You can go to Mesopotamia. So these cities were competition with each other for people because people provided labor and resources. Does that make sense? Right? So this is how it usually works. But over time, this system will break down. OK? This system will break down. And it's because of rent-sticking behavior. OK? So the first issue is this. With rent-sticking behavior, you create something called debt. OK? So I'm a landlord, and you are paying me rent in order to use my land. Right? And that land and that rent is usually a portion of your crops. So does that make sense? Maybe 10% of your crops. But let's just say, for example, it's a bad year. It doesn't rain. And you don't have any crops to pay me rent. So what do you do? You're supposed to pay me a rent, but you don't have the money, so what do you do? No, that comes later. What do you do first? Exactly, thank you. Yes, okay, so the first thing that happens is a boring, okay? You're basically going to debt, okay? So you promise to pay me double in the next year, and I'm like, okay, fine, right? But you get unlucky in the next year, it's also a bad year. And so for five years in a row, you are in debt. The problem with debt is this, something called compound interest. Meaning like over time, the debt becomes so large there's no way you can pay it off. If you can't pay it off, what happens now? Okay, good, yeah. So the idea is debt slavery, okay? So if you can't pay me back, you become my slave, okay? You promised me that your children would work for me for free, okay? And so debt slavery becomes the natural product of rent-seeking behavior. Does that make sense? Over time, you're always gonna have a percentage of your population who go into debt slavery. And this creates a lot of instability in society because obviously they either want to run away or they want to rebel, okay? Does it make sense? The other problem is elite overproduction. An idea here is everyone wants to be the renter, right? Everyone wants to be the landlord, right? But there's only so much land. So now people are competing for the power to charge rent. Does that make sense? Okay, so over time in any society, as the population increases, no people who go into that slavery increase, and therefore people at the bottom are very angry, but at the same time the elite, The number go up, but it's only a set amount of land. And therefore, they have to fight over the land. Doesn't make sense. And so eventually, what happens is the society goes into war as the elite fight each other for the right to charge rent. Doesn't make sense. And so the main message of elite production is unless you can control the amount, the number of the elite in society, your society must collapse. Does that make sense? It must collapse because you have too many people fighting for too little power. It must collapse. So historically, what are things you can do to control the elite? What are things you can do to control the number of the elite. Should we? Kill the elite? OK. But then where does the property go? So one possible thing you can do is the idea of land redistribution. So historically, this is one mechanism you can use to control the growth of the elite. And this is how kings came into power. So most societies have an elite and then one person from the elite said, listen, this society's not working, let me redistribute the land and cancel debt in order for our society to keep on going, okay? And this person became the king. So that's one possible solution, okay? What's another possible solution? To me? So you can also have a civil war, okay? Civil war, okay? The elite can fight amongst themselves and whoever wins gets everything, okay? So it's a second possible solution. What's another possible solution? What's another possible solution? OK, empire building, right? Does it make sense? Empire building. In other words, let's not fight amongst ourselves. Let's go and conquer new territory. It doesn't make sense. So because you have a permanent, heritatory elite, over time, they're going to reach a mass. Too many people. We have too many elite. You have to resolve this issue through three ways. The first thing you can do is kill the elite and redistribute the land. That's what a king does. The second thing you can do is have a civil war. The third thing you can do is create an empire. But these three solutions by themselves are also unstable. Because land redistribution is basically a revolution. Civil war is war. Empire building is also war. Doesn't make sense. So no matter how you do these things, you're always gonna create instability. And eventually, your empire, your society will collapse. Doesn't make sense, all right? So let me give you another example of how this works. To clarify for you, okay? So there's a book called, Capital in the 21st century by Thomas Piketty. Thomas Piketty is a French economist. And this is a very famous book that's been recently published. And in the book, he looked at the past 100 years of economic growth. And what he discovered over time is the financial economy grows faster than the real economy. Capital grows faster than manufacturing. Okay? So if you look at capital, grows at 5%. Real economy grows at 2%. All right? If things stay stable over time, this will happen to all societies. Capital will grow faster than the real economy. What this means is, let's just say you have a million dollars, okay? I have a million dollars. I have different options to invest my money. I can start a factory or I can start or I can put all my money into real estate or the stock market. Where should I put my money? I can open a factory, right? Or I can put it in a stock market. Where should I put my money? Yes, or why? Exactly, you understand. If you have money today, you do not put your money into the factories. You do not open a new business. you put it in the stock market because you make more money that way. What's the problem with that? It's, yeah, exactly. It's just a bubble guys, okay? Why is it a bubble? Because money isn't real. Capital isn't real. It's a fiction. You understand? So in other words, you don't work anymore. You understand? You're just renting now, okay? You're engaging in the rent-seeking behavior. We have too many people doing that. You have to society where nobody works. Doesn't make sense. Nobody does any work because all the wealth is being put into red-sinking behavior. It's being put into speculation. So no one's doing any more work. No one's creating more wealth. And this eventually leads to social collapse at some point. Okay? Doesn't make sense? All right? So Peter Torch's theory of elite overproduction is because the number of rich people can only go up over time, your society must collapse at some point. Unless you choose to have a revolution, or you have a civil war, or you go invade other countries, okay? Those are your three options. But if you did that, that creates more instability. So over time, no matter how you structure your society, it will collapse. Does that make sense? So that's what happened during the brunch. It collapsed, where the societies, mustn't agree, high-tides, Egypt, Kenan, they were fundamentally unstable because of red-sticking behavior. Same with the Mayans, where they were growing very fast, but eventually they collapsed. All studies will do this at some point. No society is stable. And the reason why is you have an elite in charge who help society grow, but over time, they will just engage in red-sicking behavior, which will eventually lead to collapse of society. Doesn't make sense, right? And this is a pattern that we'll see over and over again in human history. And we'll discuss this idea throughout the semester. Doesn't make sense. Any questions? Right, so let's look at a very specific example of rencing behavior, mycenaean gris. Mycenaean gris. So mycenaean gris, and you may remember this from last class, it was a long time ago, but last class we talked about the Yemnaya, right? The Yemnaya, right, they conquered Europe. So the mycenaean gris and the hittites are direct descendants of the Yemnaya. And as you remember, this is a warrior culture. So these societies are warrior societies, meaning the warriors are in charge. And they have a system called a palace economy. A palace economy. A palace economy is basically the palace is at the center of society. And everyone brings their wealth to the palace to be redistruded to everyone else. So the idea here is we're all farmers, right? And maybe you have 100 bushels of wheat, maybe 20 bushels of corn, okay? Everyone brings everything to the palace and then the king redistributes everything to you, okay? But obviously he takes a cut, understand? So this is called retzing behavior where you're basically paying taxes, okay? Does it make sense? Okay. Now, this is fine when things are good. Okay. But if there's, if the weather becomes bad, this system starts to collapse. Why? If the weather is bad, things start to become chaotic. Why? Okay. The reason why is they lead still want their cut. You understand? It's not like, oh, this year the weather's bad, so let's just suffer together, okay? Let's make sacrifices together. No, it's like, no, we don't care if the weather's bad, you still have to pay our cut, okay? You still have to pay your taxes, right? And that creates strain on the people. And the people get very angry, okay? So we have evidence that during the Bronze Age, there was an internal revolt in Mycenaean Greece. And the reason why is we can dig up my city in Greece, okay? The palace, and what we see is the palace is burnt down, but the surrounding houses are fine. Okay, does that make sense? We also have written records from my city in Greece that show how the policy economy worked, okay? We can also dig up the graves of the kings and show that over time they became waffer and waffer, because when they were buried, the things they were buried with were very expensive. Does that make sense? So that's my understanding in Greece. Any questions so far? OK, it's clear about this idea. So what a lot of scholars believe is that the Bronteys Collapse was a unique event in European history. And what I'm trying to show you is it was not a unique event. It was not a revolution. It's just part of the natural cycle of history. Because when you have an elite who engage in red-sinking behavior, eventually, this society will collapse. Because you have too many elite who want their cut. And when we look at other societies, you will discover that this pattern repeats itself. So this is Peter Turchin, hysteria of elite over production. Are we clear? Yes? OK. So let me clarify about my seeing gris. The problem is that you have too many rich people who want to charge rent. And that creates pressure on society. And this instability means that your society is no longer resilient, okay? Resilient. And the idea of resilience is that it survives disasters. Right? So think of a tower that's about to collapse, okay? It will not collapse on its own. Something must hit it for it to collapse. But this one thing could be anything, okay? It could be the people get angry and they riot. It could be the weather turns bad, okay? It could be there's an earthquake. It could be there's an invasion. Does that make sense? So these different societies, okay, my city in Greece, Hytites, the Kenyanites, they collapse for different reasons. But the fundamental reason is because their societies were unstable. The reason why they were unstable is you had too many elite people trying to charge rent on everyone else. Does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? That's a good question, thank you. Excuse me? Oh, can you avoid the cycle into that society? Okay, that's a great question and the answer is no. Okay, it is impossible to build a society that is stable over a long period of time. In fact, you can make the argument that it is good for societies to rise and fall. Okay, it's the same thing as, it's really the same question as is it possible for us to live forever? Is it possible for us to live forever? Then the question then is, why would we want to live forever? You understand? Innovation happens when we die. OK? So what's amazing about the Bronze Age collapse is because the Bronze Age collapsed, my singing grease changed into a new society that gave us Greek civilization, which then gave us Western civilization. OK? So in other words, if my singing that collapsed, we would not have today. Also, because Kynan collapsed, a new society came into being called the Israelites, Israel. And Israel gave us what? You guys know? The Bible. And guess what, guys? The Greeks and the Bible are the two foundations of Western civilization. So we would not have Western civilization if these societies that collapse and new societies could come into being. So you can make the argument that innovation, progress, is driven by death and collapse. Do you understand? And if we did not die, if we did not die, besides that collapse, there'd be no progress. Does that make sense? But that's a good question. And people will have been debating this question for a long time, but I think the answer is it is impossible to build a society that lives forever. Even though people have tried, and also we shouldn't even try, okay? Because collapse is good. Also think of a force fire. Have you guys studied force fires in school, in science class? Force fires, force fires guys. Each time there's a force fire, okay? The force burns down, that's good, because it allows the force to regenerate and become stronger. What happens if you don't have a force fire? Do you guys know? The resilience goes down. And also the ecosystem is less vibrant. There are less animals, the trees are less strong. Do you understand? So that's why it's important to burn down the force now and then. If you don't put it on the forest, and then it's less resilient. So there's a big forest fire. It will spread and destroy the entire forest. Does that make sense? So it's good for society to constantly change over time. Any more questions? OK, that's a great question. All right, so before we talk about egalitarian societies, how they were at most 10,000 people. And they did have an elite, okay? They had an elite. They had people in charge, but this elite didn't own the property. There was no private property, okay? So it got terrier. And so these societies were pretty stable, okay? And the reason why is usually it was the woman in charge and the woman were good at controlling population, okay? Because as a woman, you have control over your body. So you could choose not to have children or have less children. And it was very peaceful, right? People didn't really fight. There was nothing to fight over. Everything was owned by everyone else. The problem with egotistical societies are these three things. They're less organized, meaning they are less willing or less able to create public projects. They have less wealth, and therefore they have less scale. You can have at most 10,000 people. Which means what? which means like, eventually they'll be conquered. Okay, does that make sense? Because if you are one of these societies, okay, you're an empire, you must constantly expand in order to please the elite, basically, okay? Either you expand or you fight a civil war. And so you take over egotistical societies and you make them into your society, okay? Do you understand? So for most of the human history, we're egalitarian. But that's because we didn't have that many people. But over time, as population increases, then you are less egalitarian. You become more unequal. You stay egalitarian. You will eventually be conquered by a not an egalitarian society. Does that make sense? But that's a great question. You're exactly right. for most of human history were egalitarian. But once we start to develop elite societies, kingdoms, then it could easily conquer egalitarian societies. Any more questions? But that was a fantastic question. Okay, any more questions? And when we do, so we are skipping ahead, but when we do Samaria, Samaria, which is basically many different city states in Iraq, Mesopotamia, What we will discover is that there are different social structures, okay? There are different social structures, including societies that were egalitarian. But when you're in competition with each other, societies that are more organized, more wealthy, now bigger populations will always win out over other societies. Okay? You have these three things, you need a permanent, because they are more incentivized in order to work harder. Okay, does that make sense? And then the question then is, okay, why is that true? And it's true because for societies to become welfare, you don't need everyone to work hard. You just need a certain number of people to work hard. You just need a small group of people to work hard. It doesn't make sense? So think of like China, right? How China became wealthier these past 30, 40 years. And the reason why is you had a small number of entrepreneurs who worked really, really hard, okay? Not everyone worked hard, okay? But because you had these people who did work really hard, China became wealthier. Does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? Okay, so great, okay? So again, what makes this class different from other classes is we are looking at the entire scope of human history, all right? And so it's very important for you to not remember the facts, okay? I don't need you to remember the facts, okay? I don't need you to remember my sony agrees or the sea peoples, but I do need you to remember the concepts and the ideas, okay? How the world history is constantly competition with each other, and why is it that some ideas win out over other ideas. So that's saying this is the best idea. I'm not saying a permanent heritatory elite is a really good idea. I don't think it's a good idea. But I'm showing you why it wins out and how it impacts human history and the development of civilization. Does that make sense? OK. Any more questions? Well, that's it."}

And then about 50,000 years ago, because of climate change, we started to spread around the world, okay? We went into Europe, then into Asia, then we crossed the Bering Strait into North America in South America, Asia went to Australia, okay? And 50,000 years ago, there's about a million of us around the world. And the argument that I'm making you, that I made to you in this class is that from the very beginning, we were religious, okay? We know from the Ice HK paintings, we know because of place like Goblet Tepe and kind of Hoiak that we had a religious belief that told us who we are and what we're doing here. And as we discussed in class, this religious belief is animistic, meaning we believe that we all come from one source, the mother goddess, and we are all the children of the mother goddess, including animals, plants. And because of this, we were a very compassionate people that were egalitarian, there was no difference between men and women, that was peaceful, we were violent, there were some violence, but we didn't really fight wars, okay? And we were artistic, we celebrated the mother goddess through paintings and through artwork, okay? And now the question then is, if we were like this for most of human history, how is it that today we have war, private property, and patriarchy, where men make all the rules and women have little agency and power? And so this week I will explain to you how this happened. So in today's class, we will discuss really the height of this civilization. And this is what the anthropologist Maria Gumbotas called Old Europe. So to begin the story, I want to tell you what we've discovered in terms of linguistics. So for many hundreds of years, many people have speculated that maybe English, German, Greek, Latin all came from the same language that's been lost to us. This is a language we call proto-Indo-European. And through decades of strange research, linguists have been able to conclusively prove that all these languages that we speak in Europe, okay, all come from the same mother language, the first language. But not only that, but also Iranian and Indian, okay, Hindi, okay, all come from proto-inter-European. So the question, so does that make sense to you guys? So we know this because there are many words that sound the same in many languages. So for example, father in English is father, right? But in Latin it's patar, that's where we get the word paternity from the father. Greek, pataras, Persian, padar, Hindi in India, pita. So the word father seems to come from just one word in all these different languages. Then you look at the word mother, okay? Mother, Matar, Matara, Madar, Math, okay? Also sounds very similar. So again, for 100 years, people have speculated that there was just one language. And if you look at this map, okay? for example, the English word for two, okay, number two. You can draw a schematic that shows you how all these languages, the word two, derive just from one word, doa, okay? So linguists have been able to piece together this proto-inter-European language. We've also been able to figure out how this language spread, okay? So there are two hypotheses. Either the language spread from Turkey and Anatolia or from Ukraine, basically Russia. And we know it spread all around the world. So basically all of Europe and including Iran and India. So this is the first language of all these languages that we speak today in most of Asia and all of Europe. So any questions so far? All right, now the problem for linguists is how do you piece together the language, okay? Because this language is lost to us. So this language is lost to us. And so what linguists did, okay, and this is a very slow process, is they basically looked at all the words that seemed to come from the same word in different languages. What they discovered is that there's certain words that are distinct to the first language. So words like bull, cow, ox, ram, ew, lamb, pig, piglet, sour milk, y, curds, field, dog, shear, wool, textiles, scratch plow, oxen, yoke, grain, shaffer, grain, shah, furrow, wrestling, grinding, pesto, household. What do you guys notice about these words? Do you see patterns in these words? What patterns do you see in these words? Okay, so what these words tell us is the culture and lifestyle of the proto-Indo-Europeans. Does that make sense? So from these words, we're able to figure out four things about the proto-Indo-Europeans. The first thing is that unlike other cultures, these people have a word for wheel. In fact, they have five different words for wheel. And what this tells us, what we can guess that these people, whoever they are, they invented the wheel. Okay, does that make sense? We said they have words for wheel and other cultures don't. Okay, so they were the first to invent The wheel. Second is that they have words for dairy products, cow milk. And this is important. Why? Do you guys know why this is important? Why is this strange? Yes. So they were raising livestock. What makes this strange is that for most of human history, we were lactose intolerant, meaning we did not have the ability to drink milk. So these people, not only did they invent the wheel, but they changed their system, biological system, so that they became lactose tolerant. They now have the capacity to drink milk. Does that make sense? So where these people are are the first people to drink cow milk. The second characteristic, sorry, the third characteristic is they really don't have that many agricultural terms. So maybe they farmed, but they weren't focused on farming, okay, whereas other cultures were focused on farming. That's the third thing. The fourth thing is they have words for horse. And this is important because this tells us that they were first to domesticate the horse, meaning that they could control the horse, okay? This is important because throughout history, horses, if they see a human, they run away, okay? Because that's the best way to survive. If you see someone coming, you run away. This is what we call excitability, okay? Horses are excited. So it took 1,000 years for these people, the proto-Indo-Europeans, to domesticate the horse, which means they could ride the horse. It doesn't make sense. So we don't know who these people were, but based on their language, we're able to guess four things, okay? So this is a theory. Now what's interesting is that archaeologists start to dig up things, and they start to discover the linguists were right, okay? By saying the language, the linguists had four hypotheses. And the archaeologists were able to provide evidence this is true. The most exciting thing is that for the past five to 10 years, advances in genetics, DNA technology, we've been able to look at the DNA of the skeletons. And we've been able to confirm a lot of these hypotheses. Does that make sense? So what I'm telling you is, for the longest time, we guess that the proto-Indo-Europeans existed. But now we have conclusive sonic evidence that they did exist and who they were. Does that make sense? All right, so wheels. So again, they have five different words for wheels. And we're able to know from the archaeological evidence the wheels were invented about 3500 BC in this area, basically Russia. And because wheels are part of proto-Indo-European, then this language, whoever starts first speaking, must have been speaking after 3,500 BC. Does that make sense? There aren't that many agricultural terms in proto-Indo-European. We have a lot of words for milk, to milk, sour milk, buttermilk, cheese, cow. So whoever these people were, dairy products were a very important part of their culture and their diet. This is DNA evidence that shows us that these people, who we call the Yanaya, these people are called the Yanaya, they were able to develop hormones that allow them to be lactose tolerant. Okay? In about 4,500 BCE, very few people could drink milk. And by the time of the Yenaya, about a thousand years later, they could basically all drink milk. And because they could drink milk, what happens to their body? Can you guys know? What's the difference? If you drink milk, exactly, okay? So we know from the evidence that these people are taller than everyone else. In fact, these people, because they drink milk and they eat a lot of protein, they were on average 20 centimeters taller than farmers. Okay, does that make sense to you guys? Okay? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, okay, okay. So the milk we drink today is very different from the milk that they drank before. You understand? The milk they drank before came from cows that were raised in grassland. So it's all natural. The milk we drink today comes from cows that are raised in factories. And we inject a lot of drugs and hormones into these cows. Do you understand? No, no, no, no. If you drink milk a lot, your bones will be healthier and you'll grow taller. That's just biological evidence. Does that make sense? The milk we drink today, we put a lot of chemicals into the milk, and the sourcing of the milk is from factories, okay? And the reason why is we wanna make the milk cheaper, but it's worse for you, okay? So in other words, if you really want to be healthy, what you should do is go buy a cow, and drink from that cow. Okay, do you understand? All right? Okay, so are we clear? Okay, all right. Now, what's really interesting is the domestication of the horse. So again, there's a gene in the horse for excitability. Basically, the horse is programmed to run away if it sees danger, a human being. And it took us about 3,000 years, from 3,500 BCE until 2020 BCE, to domesticate the horse. because it's very hard to make horses not run away when there's danger. Doesn't make sense. So this is a very long process, but they were able to accomplish it. The further evidence for the domestication of a horse is we've been able to dig up skeletons, okay? And what we see is the skeletons of the Anaya are different from other skeletons and it's because they ride horses, okay? that changes the curvature of the skeleton. Does it make sense, guys? So the evidence is pretty overwhelming. Eventually, they were able to put all the pieces together. They were able to put the horse and the wheel together, and as such, they create the wagon. The wagon meant they could move from place to place, and they became what we call nomadic pastures. Pastoralist, okay? So have you guys been to Mongolia? Have you guys been to Mongolia? To me? Yeah, same, okay? But you see the way they, the way they make a living is they have like cows and sheep, right? And they take the cows and the sheep from place to place to eat the grass, right? And they're able to do that because they're able to put all the belongings into a wagon and move from place to place Okay, doesn't make sense. So these are the people who were the first speakers of proto-Indo-European, and eventually, they're able to spread their language all around the world, okay, from Europe to India to Iran. Okay, doesn't make sense, guys. Now the question is, okay, we're able to confirm that these people actually existed, And we are able to confirm that they did spread the language around the world. Now the question to debate is, how do they do so? And there's two sides to the argument. The first side believes these people were conquerors. So think Genghis Khan and the Mongols. They went around. they were able to spread their language by conquering other people, okay? So think Genghis Khan and the Mongols. Think of the European conquest of North and South America where the English and the Spanish and the French went to North and South America and eradicated the local population, okay? So that's the first belief. The second belief is that it was not violent, okay? It was just cultural diffusion. meaning I came to your country or your village and I was able to influence you and convince you that my language is superior. So we call this cultural diffusion. So think of English where, okay, China has not been conquered by the West, but we wanna learn English because we think that learning English will give us more life opportunities. Does that make sense? So there's two such other debate. either one of conquest or one of cultural diffusion. And this debate went on for a long time, okay? And for most of the time, we believed it was cultural diffusion. But now for the past five, 10 years, we have overwhelming DNA evidence that it was in fact conquest. It was a genocide. It was a violent conquest. And this is what I will show you next class. But in today's class, what I will show you is the Europe before the conquest. Does that make sense? And then next class, we will look at how Europe was conquered and how Europe was changed because of the conquest. Any questions so far? So there's a good question. The question is, what's the difference between conquest and diffusion? The answer is this. If I conquer you, I eradicate your genes. I kill you, okay? Therefore your genes do not come into the present day. Whereas if it's diffusion, your genes are still around. Does that make sense? Okay? So now what I will show you next class is, sorry, a lot of these genes have been eradicated. Therefore it must have been a violent conquest. It doesn't make sense. Okay. All right. So let's now look at Europe before the conquest. And a lot of what we know about Europe comes from a very famous anthropologist. Her name is Marieg Mbatez. And we'll be spending a lot of time today talking about her theories. But what we know is, remember the ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. Now the planet is warming, which allows for agriculture. We also know that agriculture started in Anatolia, Turkey, and in Egypt, and in Mesopotamia, OK? Basically, this region. And the reason why is this place was the first to warm up, but it also had better soil than other places, OK? So they discovered farming in this region. And then about 6500 BCE, agriculture started to spread around the world, okay? To Europe and then over to England. Does that make sense, guys? Okay, another question then is, what propelled this migration from Anatolia to Europe? Can you guys guess? What would propel this migration? Okay, a good guess is war, okay? But we don't have any evidence of war around this time. What's another explanation? Why people wouldn't move? Exactly, thank you. Climate change, okay? The weather became a lot cooler during this time, making it harder for people to farm, okay? Also, they've been farming for a long time in this area, which meant that the soil is longer as good as before, okay? So you had these massive migrations of families into Europe because Europe at this time, it was becoming, the weather was becoming a lot warmer, which allowed people to start to grow agriculture in this area, okay? So in about 6,500 BCE, people started to move Anatolia into this area. And because they were moving, they brought with them their religion, okay? Remember like the religion of Gobletepae and kind of Holiak is one of the mother goddess, giving life to everything, okay? And because of that, we know that the people in this area were mainly egalitarian, peaceful, and artistic. Does that make sense? Okay. What we'll study next class is that there are two massive migrations into Europe, all caused by climate change. The first migration are farmers, okay? The second migration are pastoralists. And what I will show you next class is that we will look at the DNA evidence. So if you look at the DNA of people today, what you will see is that about 4,500 BCE, most people in Europe, their genes were a mix of farmers who came from Anatolia, as well as hunter-gatherers who were there originally. Does that make sense? But then after 3000 BCE, you have this green come in. And the green are the Yenaya, the proto-Indo-Europeans. And so I will show you this next class. But I want you guys to understand what happened. Does that make sense? So again, this is a map of the migration. So agriculture was started in about 9000 BCE in the Near East, Turkey, Anatolia, as well as Israel, Syria, Jordan, then it spread from, what's a thousand to Europe, okay? And then the purple is the Yemaya people, okay? Who believe, were from Ukraine in the steppes, and they spread around the world. Next class, we'll discuss who the Yemaya were and how they conquered the world, okay? But at first, I want to look at the farmers who built Europe before the conquest of the Amaya. So again, Maria Gumbutas, who is an anthropologist originally from Luthuriania, but who worked at Harvard and UCLA, she's done decades of research into old Europe. And her conclusion is that old Europe was conquered by the Amniotic people. And this is what we know as the Kuergen hypothesis. So let me explain what the Kuergen hypothesis is. We know the burials of the farmers is very different from the burials of the Amniotic people. The major difference is this. the people who are farmers are buried together, okay? But the people of the Anaya, they're buried alone. Not only are they buried alone, but they're buried with weapons and with cattle and horses. So what we can guess from this, okay? We don't have evidence, but what we can guess from this is that the farmers were people who did not have power of property and who were egalitarian, okay, and who were peaceful because they didn't have any weapons. And the Anayar were the complete opposite, okay. These were warriors who believed in private property and which was male dominated, okay. Does that make sense? So this is what we refer to as the Kirkian hypothesis. And for the longest time, there's something that Maria Gumbottas argued And she was laughed at. Why was she laughed at? Why would people laugh at her? She's saying like, okay, before the Yemar came to Europe, Europe was a place that was basically governed by woman. And it was artistic, and it was peaceful, and it was egalitarian. Why would people laugh at her? Yeah, they don't believe in her, why? And, excuse me? Yeah, yeah. First of all, in universities, it's the men who are the professors, right? It's the men who are scholars. So there are many men who are like, there's no way woman can be in charge. They're idiots. Okay? Why would woman be in charge? They're stupid. They're useless. It's men who are always in charge. Okay? That's one reason why they laugh at her. What's another reason? Why they would laugh at her? Okay? There are also a lot of people who believe like people are violent. We've had wars always. The idea that for like thousand years Europe was peaceful can't be true because people are violent, humans are meant to go to war against each other. The third reason why people would laugh at her is we think that we are motivated by money. If you don't have money then why would you do anything? Does that make sense? So Maria Gumbotas had this radical idea that challenged the way that men saw the world. For men, men have always been in charge, there's always been wars, and there's always been wealth and money to motivate people to work hard. And that's what men believe. And Maria Gumbotas said, no, that's not true. For thousands of years, from 6500 BCE until about 2500 BCE, 4,000 years before they were conquered, Europe was ruled by women. And because of that, Europe was peaceful, egalitarian, and artistic. Okay, so this is a radical idea. And again, what I will show you next class is this idea that was laughed at decades has now been confirmed by DNA evidence, meaning that this has been proven true by science, okay? Doesn't make sense. Okay, so let's look at what Rikkunbates said. And she's written quite a few books. These are two of our most famous. The Language of the Goddess and the Civilization of the Goddess. Okay, so her main theory is that Europe at that time, their main belief is in the mother goddess who gives life to everything. And so what she did was she went and she dug up their graves to look at their art and she studied their language and their cultural practices. Does it make sense? Any questions so far? So this is from the civilization of the goddess and we'll read this together. And so this is her main argument about old Europe at that time. The goddess in all her manifestations was a symbol of the unity of all life in nature. So we are all connected together. Animals, trees, humans, we're all connected together. We're all one big family. Her power was in water and stone, in tomb and cave, in animals, and birds, snakes, and fish, hills, trees, and flowers. the holistic and mytho-apoeic perception of all the sacredness and mystery of all there is on earth. So everything in the world is sacred because it is blessed by the mother goddess. If there's a mosquito, don't kill that mosquito because it has the energy of the mother goddess. If you're walking on a, if you're walking and you see a bird, a small bird, pick it up and heal it, okay? Because that comes from the Maudicates. Okay, does that make sense? This culture took deep the light in the natural wonders of this world. Its people did not produce lethal weapons or build forts in inexorable places, as the successors did, even when they were acquainted with metallurgy, okay? So in other words, They had the technology to make weapons. They had the technology to build forts and make war, but they chose not to. Does that make sense? Okay? These people chose, purposely chose, not to commit violence against other people. Instead, they built magnificent tomb shrines and temples, comfortable house in moderately sized villages and created superb pottery and sculptures. This was a long lasting period of remarkable creativity and stability and age-free of strife. Their culture was a culture of art. It doesn't make sense. They spent all their time and energy in producing art to celebrate the mother goddess and to celebrate nature and to celebrate themselves. And this was remarkably peaceful and stable. Does it make sense, guys? Okay, any questions so far? Okay. What was amazing about this culture is they invented writing. Now for the longest time, we believe that the Samaritans, which we will discuss later on, the Samaritans, who lived in Iraq, we believe they discovered writing. And we discovered that writing came up for economic purposes. So for example, if you are in Samaria and you need to build a temple, what you do is you create writing. So for example, here's a clay, and I say this. So this is writing, right? What does this mean? It means like these two people, this family of two, will get two bushes of wheat and two baskets of bread for their work today. Does that make sense? So we thought that for the longest time, people created writing for economic purposes in order to have an economy. But what Murid Gumbotas has discovered is, no, we actually created writing before for religious purposes. So for example, if I have a painting, it goes like this, something like this, then what I'm saying is the mother goddess blesses this sculpture with her life and with the abundance of water in nature. Does that make sense? So writing is a way to communicate with the mother goddess. It's a way to make divine and sacred our art. Does it make sense guys? Okay, so these people are so frustrated they invented writing. Okay, now I wanna go over some of the cultural differences between that culture and our culture to show how stark the differences, okay? So for example, in today's culture When we think of snake, we think of poison, danger, right? We've been taught that snakes are dangerous. But in this culture, the snake was a symbol of life energy and regeneration because snakes can shed their skin, right? A most benevolent, not an evil creature, okay? So that's one major difference. Another major difference between our culture and their culture is, in today's world, we think that white is good, black is bad, right? And we can imagine that black is good, white is bad, right? But in their culture, that's exactly what they believe, okay? Black did not mean death or the underworld. It was a color of fertility, the color of damp caves and rich soil, of the womb, of the goddess where life begins. What, on the other hand, was the color of death of bones? Okay, does that make sense? So back then, for most of human history, we thought that white was bad because it symbolized death, and black was good because it symbolized life. And we can't possibly imagine that today, right? The last thing I want to talk about, and this is actually the most controversial thing, is back then, for most of human history, woman had power in agency. What I mean by that is back then a woman's body was her body. She could choose to do whatever she wants with her body. Does that make sense? In today's world, if you get married, right, if a woman gets married, then we assume the woman's body belongs to the husband. Only the husband can sleep with her. It doesn't make sense. But for most of human history, this was not true. Okay? All right, so you look at sexual taboos today, okay? What do we have sexual taboos? To shame woman into proper behavior, okay? So for example, okay, if a man sleeps with a thousand women, we think, great, he's a stud. He's good looking, he's rich, he's tall, he's a stud, right? But hey, if a woman sleeps with a thousand men, she's a slut, she's a bad person. She has no ethical, She lacks ethics. She lacks morality. She has no character. Therefore, we must avoid her. Why does this make any logical sense? Why is this true? Guys, why is this true? Okay. Yeah. Exactly. We have this, okay. We have this prejudice because men are considered superior to women and therefore men want to control women. And the best way to do that is by controlling the woman's body. It doesn't make sense. Okay, so this is just a cultural prejudice. There's no biological evidence, this is true, okay? All right, so we have a lot of evidence that women want sexual agency, okay? Women want to have sex. There's nothing wrong with that. Okay, so for example, we look at monkeys, we use these monkeys, and females will aggressively seek males out for sex. So it's the females that are proactive. You also look at Bonobos monkeys. And Bonobos monkeys is interesting because the females are in charge. The females have sex with each other. Why? Why do they have sex with each other? Or will females have sex with each other? What's the purpose of that? Unity, right? Does it make sense? unity to get along, to cooperate better. And then they will also have sex with males, but they initiate the sex. There are some cultures where it's the female that will initiate the sex with the male. So at Harvard and UCLA, they discovered, Okay, the moment they discovered the plow agriculture, these societies have lower levels of female participation in politics and the labor force, okay? Meaning like before where men and women did the same work, both had the same political power. But once men showed that they could contribute more society, men started to have more power, okay? Does that make sense? So in other words, differences between men and women are not biological constructs. They are cultural constructs. And for most of human history, men and women were equal. Any questions so far? So the idea of black and white, white is good, black is bad. It's a recent construct. It comes with the idea of race. And race wasn't better about 20 years ago. Why? Because Europe was going around conquering the world. And they needed to justify why they were doing this. And the theory is because we're superior people. Our race is better than your race. Does that make sense? So race is a recent cultural construct. And it was to justify imperialism, the conquest of other people for no reason. Does that make sense? So all this is recent. All right, there's a really fun book called Sex and Dawn by Christopher Ryan. And what he argues is that for most of human history, women had sexual agency, and they had multiple sexual partners. And one piece of evidence is this. Gorillas, they're the biggest primates. They're huge. What turns out, their penises, when fully erect, is only four centimeters, OK? Men, a lot smaller than gorillas, when erect, they are at least almost four times as big as the gorilla of penises, OK? So the question then is, why is this the case? And one theory is that when women have multiple sexual partners, the man with the bigger penis will spread his gene forward. Does that make sense, guys? And so this is evidence that for most of human history, women have had multiple sexual partners. Okay, so even when women had partners, okay, a husband, they still had sexual partners, okay? And in some societies, women have many husbands, usually brothers together, okay? All right, let me ask you this question. Why did they do this? Right? Because we've been taught this, we've been taught, okay, we exist to spread our genes, right? You understand? So if I marry someone, only if I'm sure that the offspring, the children, are mine, will I work hard to ensure that the children are fed and raised properly and educated. Does that make sense? So we've been taught for a long time that we first care about our genes. That's why men want to have as many wives and children possible and women want to find the wealthiest husband. But before most of human history, this was not true. Why? Why guys? Okay, so it has to do with the idea of religion. Okay? So the first thing is that we all come from the mother goddess. We're all equal, right? So it doesn't matter if it's my son or my friend's son. They're all the children of the mother goddess, and therefore I have a responsibility to protect the children. Does that make sense? So there was no concept of individual. There was only a concept of community. That's the first thing. Second thing is, they really didn't understand genes. They didn't understand, like, OK, a child has 50% genes from the mother, 50% genes from the father. How they understood was, OK, you have the woman, she gives life, the man gives energy. Does that make sense? Therefore what? If you believe this, then what? If the mother gives life, the man gives energy, what? What? Right? But how would you get better energy? More men, right? You understand? If men are giving you energy, the more men you have sex with, the more energy you have. Doesn't make sense. So the evidence is if you look at the people at Millennia Tia, okay? They believe that semen provided energy. And so you need a lot of semen. So what would happen is that when a woman married a husband, what would happen is the members of the husband's family would come and have sex with her that very night in order to get as much energy as possible from the family. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions so far? I know this is controversial, but I'm just trying to show you how our cultural beliefs is radically different from the cultural beliefs of people in the past. OK? Does it make sense? OK. So one last piece of evidence is this. When you don't know who your, when the people don't know who the father is, everyone has responsibility to protect the child. Okay, does that make sense to you guys? Okay, so the story is this Christian missionary, he goes into a village and he finds people just sleeping with each other, okay? There's no marriage, there's no husband and wife. People just sleeping with each other. And the priest says to them, you people are shameless. And one of the villagers replies, you have no sense. You French people love only your own children, but we all love all the children of our tribe. Okay? Here's that. So having multiple sexual partners is a way to build community for everyone. We are a small community, okay? Maybe 15, 20 people, it makes sense to make sure that everyone loves each other and that everyone will protect all the children. Does it make sense guys? All right. So let me tell you a story to illustrate this fact. We know that in World War II, American pilots, what they were doing is they were sleeping with each other's wife. Does that make sense? The reason why they were doing this is American pilots were more likely to die in war than any other soldiers. Does that make sense, guys? Therefore, you slept with the wife of your colleagues in order to ensure that if you died, they would protect your children. Because there's a good chance you would die in a war, okay? You were afraid that if I died, who's gonna look after my wife, who's gonna look after my children? And the way you build intimacy and community is by sleeping with each other's wife. So you became one big family. Okay? Does that make sense, guys? Any questions so far? I know this is controversial. I know this is hard to understand, okay? But we have evidence that for most of human history, woman had sexual agency and power and sex was a way to build community. Okay? Does that make sense? Yeah? Okay. So the question is, is this backwards or is it primitive? And what I want to show you this semester is that, okay, guys, there's no such concept as backward and primitive, okay? The reason why we care about sex more than any other people is the idea of private property, okay? Private property, okay? So for example, if I have a wife, And I do have a wife, okay? We have three kids, okay? I want my three kids to inherit the money, right? But if my wife goes sleep with other people, then who gets the private property? So in other words, we have the idea of sex as shameful because we live in a private, we live in a patriarchy. Okay, doesn't make sense. All right, okay, sorry. Let me explain some more later on, okay? All right, let's move on. All right, so I wanna conclude with this idea. I wanna conclude Maria Gumbutas argued that old Europe was ruled by women, or women were part of the political class. And because of that, Europe at that time was more peaceful and more stable than at any other time in its history. Doesn't make sense. So another question then is, why would woman as a political class be more effective than men as a political class? And there are three reasons. The first reason is women are more willing to cooperate and collaborate. It doesn't make sense. So men are competitive. We like status. We like power. But women are much more humble. So women are much more likely to compromise and collaborate than men are. Does that make sense, guys? OK? So if men are in control, then men want all the power. But if women are in control, then women are much more willing to share power with men. Does that make sense? The other thing is, let's just say your community gets conflict with another community. Well, what would happen is the women leaders of your community would get together with the women leaders of that community and you could quickly negotiate a compromise. Right? But men are competitive, they like status, they like face. So it's much more likely that when men start to negotiate, it becomes violent. Does that make sense? Okay, so that's one thing that women are better at. Women are better at collaborating and compromising. That's the first thing. Second thing is that women have more emotional intelligence. Does that make sense guys? Meaning like men care about rules, right? Women care more about you as a person. Therefore women are much better at managing people. managing people. Does that make sense? Okay. The third thing is that men can use violence to coerce other people, right? Women are not as physically strong as men, therefore they have other strategies for controlling men. And the two main strategies are gossip, okay? Basically talking about you behind your back, which which forces you to conform, but also sex. Okay? So if the woman spreads sex evenly among the man, the man have no reason to fight. And if someone, the man does something bad against community, the woman can choose to not have sex with this man. Okay? That's the way to punish him. But this is all very subtle and nonviolent meet ways of forcing people to conform to the rules of the society. Does that make sense? Any questions? This is confusing to you guys, right? So let's conclude. Before the conquest of the Yama'ya, all Europe was a peaceful, egalitarian society. And a lot of the reason why is that women were given higher status in society. So it was women who made the rules who were the political class in society. And because of that, women are able to use nonviolent ways to control society, making society much more peaceful and stable. Does that make sense, guys? Any questions? Excuse me? Okay, okay, so the question then, The question is if people are not violent, how do you control society? And so the way you control people is through the idea of shame. Because everyone wants to get along. So all right, here's a fun experiment. Here's a fun experiment. What you guys can do is every time you walk the hallways And you see a person wearing red, like a girl wearing red, you tell her, you look fantastic. Okay? I guarantee you within like two weeks, all the girls in the school will be wearing red. Does that make sense? So you're controlling people, but you're not using violence. You're using the idea of gossip, shame, and flattery. And that's what women do really well. You understand? Okay, does that answer your question? Okay, any more questions? Yeah, so you don't have to use violence. You can also use flattery, okay? Right? Any more questions? Okay, so next class, what we'll do is we'll look at the Yemaya people. Okay, because the Yemaya people are violent, they love war, they're patriarchy, and they have private property. The question then is, okay, how do they come about? What's their origin story, and why were they so successful in conquering all Europe? So that's the story we will look at next class."}

So today we start the Bible, which will be the final unit before the Sinister Break. Hopefully this will be the most interesting section we do. It's certainly the most important, because the Bible is the most important book ever. And it is driving a lot. It has driven a lot of history. It's driving a lot of history today. So if you want to fully understand the conflict in the Middle East, what's happening between Israel and Iran, what's happening in Palestine, you cannot do so without a full understanding of the Bible. At the same time, the Bible is because it's so important, the ideas around it are very controversial. There are billions of people around the world who believe the Bible is the Word of God. It's holy scripture. Every word in the Bible comes to us from the divine, the divinity himself. And obviously, that's not what I believe. More so, I'm going to make arguments in this class that go against not only the traditional understanding of the Bible, but also the mainstream academic understanding of the Bible. Bible. So to be fair to you, I want you to be very skeptical of what I say. Okay? Come to class with doubting my authority, doubting my understanding of the Bible. Okay? So feel free to challenge me, and I want you to challenge me because what I will say in this class is will be extremely controversial. Okay? So, let me give you a brief introduction to the Bible, and then I'll explain some of the history behind the Bible. Okay? And this overview is gonna be very broad, very general, but it will help structure the, or understand the Bible for the next few classes. Okay? All right, so the Bible. The Bible is Greek for books, and it really means library. So the first thing you need to understand is the Bible, it's a collection of different works by many different authors. So there's no worldview or consistency or continuity in the Bible. You can find whatever you want in the Bible because it's a library, it's a huge collection of ideas. There's about 2,000 pages. So there's very few people who actually read the Bible in its entirety. There are people who might read sections of the Bible, but most people will receive their understanding of the Bible from authorities like priests or rabbis. The Bible itself is divided into two major sections. The first section is what we call the Hebrew Bible. And so this was originally written in Hebrew. And this was, this is the major, this is the book of the Jews, okay? What do the Jews believe? They believe in the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible itself is divided into three major sections. The first is, so the Hebrew term for the Bible is the Tanakh, okay? So you may hear here some people say the Tanakh. It just means the Hebrew Bible, okay? The Tanakh is T and K. And this is the Hebrew term for certain ideas. The T stands for Torah or teachings. So this is the laws of the Jewish tradition. Okay, for example, the Ten Commandments, right? Second is N, which means prophets. Or, and the prophets themselves are divided to minor and major. So in Rome, the people who are most admired are the generals, like Julius Caesar, Pompey. In Greece, the people who are most admired are the poets, Homer, and the playwrights. In the Jewish tradition, the people who are most admired are the prophets, these individuals who speak the truth of God, they're social critics, and they're people who challenge the authority of the kings in order to promote the laws and teachings of God. Does that make sense? The prophets are the people who are most admired in the Jewish tradition. And the third R.K. is writings. So basically things that don't really belong in teachings and prophets, but which have some cultural or religious significance to the Jewish people, okay? So this is the Hebrew Bible. And then we get to the New Testament, which is something that only Christians believe. All right, so Jewish people do not accept anything in the New Testament. The New Testament calls the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament. Okay, why? Because the Old Testament is the promise of salvation. The promise of Jesus Christ. The New Testament is the deliverance or fulfillment of this promise in Jesus Christ. It's the coming and the work of Jesus Christ. The New Testament itself is like too many different works. It's a lot smaller than the Old Testament. So there are the Gospels. The Gospels is Greek for the good word. And the good news is that Jesus is on earth. And he's here to deliver us from our sins and our suffering. There's letters, mainly by someone named Paul. And these are the work of Jesus' apostles after the death of Jesus. They go around the world, they promote the gospel of Jesus, the good news. And this is about what they do. And then there's something called, there's some other books as well, but the major one is called Revelation, which is about the end of the world. And it's the idea of the second coming. How even though Jesus is dead, he will return and he will bring peace, eternal peace to the world. Now, from the Bible, an interpretation of the Bible comes to Koran. And this is the basis for Islam. Okay? So eventually we'll do all three. the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Koran. We'll start with the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible. OK? So the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible, is what we'll start with. And to do so, I will have to teach you a lot of history. And this history will be extremely broad. OK? But over time, I will be more precise. I will go into specific details about this history in order for you to better understand the Bible. Okay? There were three ideas about the Hebrew Bible that Jews believe, the Jews today believe, which are not true. Okay? The first idea is the Hebrew Bible, the Jewish religion has always been monotheistic, meaning the Jews have always believed in one God. His name is Yahweh. And he is the God of the Jews since Abraham, who is the patriarch of all Jewish people. That's what Jews believe. I will show you, this is not true. In the beginning, Jewish people, like everyone else, were polytheistic. Polytheistic is a modern idea that has been retroactively put back into Jewish history. So that's the first myth that I will correct. The second myth that I correct is that Jewish history or the Jewish religion has been continuous for at least 3,000 years, possibly 4,000 years. And what I will show you is that's not true. So there have been many major changes to the religion. And these changes are so drastic that you can argue these are very different people. So the issue of lights, the people who found it, the religion, are very different from the people we call Jews today. And I will show you why in the next few classes. That's one really important idea you need to understand. The history of the issue of lights and the Jewish people are not continuous. All right? Does that make sense? Okay, any questions so far? Are you guys following along? Okay. Yeah, so the last idea is the Bible, or the Hebrew Bible, it's a historical record. And what I will show you is, we've been trying for at least 300 years, 200 years to prove that the Bible is a historical record. There are archaeologists who spent fortunes in their lifetime looking for things like Noah's Ark, looking for people like Moses. Can't find them, okay? And this tells us pretty conclusively that the Bible is not a historical record. It is a work of our imagination. It is a literary work. Now, it's a very powerful literary work and that's what explains its relevance. and it's powered today. I'll explain why it's powerful, but I want you to remember it's not a circle word, it is a literary word, it's a work of our collective imagination. Now I'm gonna talk a little about the broad history of the Israelite people. So in the Bible what it tells you is maybe about 2000 BCE, There's a man named Abraham. And he's from the city of Eric, okay? In Mesopotamia. Or is it Ur? Okay, it's one or two, sorry. And then God, Yahweh, fought Yah, Abraham, was the best man in the world. So God, Yahweh, made a covenant with Abraham and said, you are the most righteous and dignified man I've ever seen in the world, and I will make you a father of a new nation called Israel. Okay? And these people will become eventually the Israelites. And the greatest king of the Israelites is named David. And then David, and then God says to David, David, you are the greatest man I've ever seen. I love you as you love me. Therefore I will make your house, the house of David eternal. Okay? You, the House of David, will ring over Israel for all eternity. I will make Israel into the mightiest of nations. Okay? So that is what it says in the Bible. The historical record is a lot more complicated. All right? So let's start in the year 1200 BC. And this is towards the end of the Bronze Age, right? were about to enter the branched collapse, which lasts for 100 years. At this time, let's look at the world. Issue is a place called the Levant. And the Levant has always been important, because as we discussed in previous classes, Levant was one of the first centers of agriculture. So Jericho is in the Levant. But it's also important because the Levant is where three major civilizations and empires meet. They are the crossroads or the nexus of empire. These three empires are Egypt, which, again, for most of its human history has been the wealthiest and the most powerful nation. Over here is Mesopotamia, which is the crate of civilization. This is where human civilization first developed mathematics, writing, astronomy, architecture. And up here are the high types, or Anatolia. Anatolia, again, is extremely wealthy. So the Lavaud is sandwiched between three extremely aggressive, wealthy, and powerful nations that are extremely advanced and sophisticated. So the Levant has always been a colony of either Egypt or Anatolia. It's not been very dependent for very long. And it can't be because it's at the edge of empire. But because of its position, the Levant is what we call a nothing pot or a meeting place. So every culture, every language, every religion, That was imaginable at this time met in the Levant, okay? Mainly for trade purposes, right? Because again, Egypt and Mesopotamia are extremely wealthy. From the Levant, you can go across the Mediterranean into all of Europe and into Northern Africa, okay? So the Levant was really the center of the world for most of its history. And so it was a meaning place, mainly for traders, right? At this time, Lavante was divided into different sections. A province called Canine was a province of Egypt. And Canine was special to Egypt because the Egyptians loved two things. They loved wine. They loved olive oil. And the Lavante was very good at harvesting both good wine and olive oil. So, but the Egyptians didn't really like to go outside Egypt. So the people administrating the Lavande were local elites tied to Egypt, but also foreign mercenaries. And these foreign mercenaries were from as far as Greece. And we know this because we've discovered Greek pottery that dates back to this period. These four missionaries would then intermarry with the local woman because as you can imagine these are young males. You also had lots of nomads living in the Lavaan because of Arabia, right? Lots of nomads. People we call the Bedouins. You also had people living in the hills of the Lavan, the hill people. And you have these cities, okay? The Kenyan Knights. You also had, believe it or not, Egyptian priests living in this area. Why would they live in this area? Well, because they had a certain religion that was considered heretical or controversial in Egypt So they have to leave to practice your religion. Or maybe they were priests who got into a political struggle. And as such, they were exiled to the Levant. So does that make sense? The Levant, it's not at this point a nation. At this point, it's really a meeting place, a melting pot of cultures, languages, and religions. It's as diverse as can be. And historically, this has always been the case. Then what happened, of course, is the Bronze Age collapse. The thing about the Bronze Age collapse is you have this massive migration of people looking for food. These are all the sea peoples. They're basically pirates. And there are these massive waves of sea people attacking the Hightites, attacking the Levant, and attacking Egypt. But again, these are like refugees. This is forced migration, and they're trying to feed their families. They basically overrun the high tides. They destroy the cities of the Lovat. And they almost destroy Egypt. But Egypt, because it's so wealthy, it's able to hold off the Sea people. Eventually what happens is the Sea peoples and Egypt come to an agreement and say, listen, Stop attacking us and we'll give you land in the Lavate. You can sit down there, you can go your own food, you feed your families. And this place is what we call Philistia. And this is what, and this is what we call Philistines. So these are basically the Sea Peoples, mainly Greek actually. There are a lot of Greeks among the Philistines. But this creates a problem for everyone in the Lavate because now you have a foreign presence that is very aggressive and expansionist. So now the people in the Levant need to come together and fend off this threat from the Philistines. They also have these neighbors as well, these other cultures that keep on attacking them. So these are extremely diverse people. And so what they agree to do is elect a king to lead them in war against the Philistines. And this person is named Saul, King Saul. And King Saul is a very good king. He's a very good military leader. He's helping the people in the Levant then all the Philistines and aggressive neighbors. Okay, so this is the military alliance. King Saul employs a lot of mercenaries. And one of these mercenaries is named David. David. David is an extremely capable, charismatic soldier who develops a following. David, as you can imagine, because he's very charismatic, is also very ambitious. And eventually, he has a following up with Saul. David is so best general, best soldier, but David is too ambitious and so sort of suspects David. So what David does is he runs off and joins the Philistines. Okay? He's not fighting for the Philistines. What's really important for us to understand, and I know it's a hard concept, okay, but borders and alliances and allegiances are extremely fluid at this time. If it benefits me, I'll fight for you. But if it doesn't benefit me, then I'll betray you. There are different factions within all alliances. So the Philistines are divided among different ethnic groups. The people in the Lavaan are divided into different political factions. You have these hill people, you have these nomads, you have these foreign missionaries, and they're fighting for different reasons. So these alliance are always shifting. So David goes off and fights for the Philistines. King Saul and his sons are eventually killed in battle. And David sees a political opening. So he turns back into Levant, and he starts to politically maneuver to be the new king. And his power base is in a place called Habran, or in itself, the Levant. But the House of Saul is still around. And so there's a civil war now going on, and eventually David triumphs. And then David's able to unite these people, and he creates a new nation called Israel. And then Israel is able, under David's leadership, is able to basically put down any aggressions from its neighbors. and they're able to build an empire, a small empire, okay? No way near Egypt, but it's an empire, all right? So this is what we know from the archeological record. But David is so charismatic that when he dies, his son Solomon is not able to hold the empire together. So what happens is Israel divides divides into the Northern Kingdom and Judah, which is where the house of David is. Now again, the Lovat is a very important strategic location. So as these major empires start to consolidate the power, they want to take over the Lovat. So the Syrian empire comes in and destroys Northern Kingdom. And then eventually, the Babylonian Empire will come in and destroy Judah. The Babylonians will take the Israel elite, basically the royalty, and force them to go to Babylon, where they will be held as hostages or captives. Eventually, what will happen next is the Persian Empire will come and defeat Babylon. And what they do next is very interesting. They decide they will release these Israelite elite, have them return to Jerusalem and Israel, and have them govern the Levant based on, and have them govern the Levant. Does that make sense? And it is only at this point that we get the term Jews. This is a Persian idea, the Jews, before they called the Israelites. And this is about 500 BC, okay? 500 BC. And now we have a radical departure from the tradition, okay? And so I'll explain three major differences. And then I'll explain, I'll go into detail about these differences in future classes, okay? The first major difference is Israel, And the issue lies, it's a polytheistic religion. They have one god, Yahweh, but they also have a pantheon of gods, which is true for every other religion, right? There's a pantheon of gods. Yahweh's at the top, but they also celebrate other gods like Baol and Ashura. We know because they're written down in the Bible. So we know at this point, Israel is still a polytheistic religion. But after the Persian Empire returns them to Judaism, they became a monotheistic religion, or the beginnings of a monotheistic religion. Why? Because when the Jews are released from captivity by the Persians, their religion merges with that of the Persian religion called Zoroastrianism. And Zoroastrianism is a dualistic religion, meaning there's good and evil. So that's the first major difference. At the beginning, the Bible was very much a polytheistic religion. And then after the Israelites became the Jews, it became monotheistic. Second big difference is this. Second big difference is during this time, the people with the power in Israel were the kings, the monarch king. But after 500 BCE, the Jews decided they didn't want any kings. And they couldn't have kings because their overlords are the Persians, right? So the center of power became the priesthood, OK? The priest. The people with the absolute authority are the priests, not the kings. There are kings, but the kings are not observient to the priests who speak on behalf of Yahweh. Because now it's a monotheistic religion. And then there's one other difference. The other difference is, remember, at this point they're polytheistic and they're kings, which means they are tolerant. They're welcoming of other religions because you're polytheistic. But also, as kings, you need to establish diplomatic alliances with other countries who have different religions, right? So when you marry someone from another political dynasty, you also are marrying into that religion. Does that make sense? So Israel under the king is a very tolerant religion. But if you're run by priests, right? You become intolerant because you insist that your religion is the best. And that's why after the Persian's lost control and the Greeks came in to the Levant, this is the solution empire, the Jews rebelled against the Greeks. Because the Greeks were polytheistic, and the Jews considered themselves monotheistic. They refused to acknowledge the culture and the religion of the Greeks. And then things are really bad, and the Romans came in. Does that make sense? So this is the history of the Jewish people up until the birth of Jesus. Any questions so far? Do you guys understand what's happening? Excuse me? OK. So how did the Bronze Age collapse? OK, we talked about this. We don't know why it collapsed. The mainstream academic understanding is it was a perfect storm of several factors, including climate change, including civil unrest, including natural disasters like earthquakes, including competition among empires. What's important to understand is when you talk about a bunch of collapse, we're really talking about basically this area. If you go east to Mesopotamia where the Assyrian and the Babylonians are, they're fine. And it's the Bronze Age collapse that allow the Assyrians and the Babylonians to eventually become world powers. So the Bronze Age collapse was not a global phenomenon, it was a localized phenomenon to the Mediterranean. But why the Bronze Age collapse is important is because the Bronze Age collapse will give us Greek civilization, Homer and Plato, okay? It will also give us the Bible, right? Because if you look at this history, Israel would not have come into being without the Bronze Age collapse. Egypt or the Hittites would continue to control the Lavaht, right? And it's important to understand the Greeks and the Bible are the two fundamental pillars of Western civilization. You understand? That's why Westerners are so fascinated by the Bronze Age collapse. Because in their minds, the Bronze Age collapse is part of God's divine plan or design to create classical Greece in the nation of Israel so that his vision for the world can be achieved through Jesus. Yep, that's fine. Okay, so that's a good question. So the argument I'm trying to make to you is the Bible says Abraham is a patriarch of the Israelites. But the historical record, the actual record is we barely have evidence of David. We have absolutely no evidence of anything before David, okay? So I think David is the founder of the nation of Israel, not Abraham. Next class, I will explain to you why they constructed this mythology, okay? But first, I want to give you a broad overview. Next class, I will explain to you where these ideas, Abraham and Moses came from. It'll make sense when I explain to you. But do you guys have any more questions before I go on? Yeah? Okay, right, okay. Okay, so what happened, during the Persian period, right? Okay, so at this point, the religion of Israel is no different from the local areas. It's a polytheistic religion. We have a pantheon of gods, okay? And maybe Yahweh's at the top, or maybe Yahweh's co-equal, okay? We don't know. And at this point, there are many divergent religions. Okay? But what happens is Babylon conquers Jerusalem Jerusalem and then the Jews are sent in exile. So now the religion is sent overseas and the religion is detached from the culture and the people. Does that make sense? And what we know is when you do that, when you detach the religion and you put it into a place that has no reactions with the local people and the culture, it becomes much more fanatical, much more focused and fanatical. Okay, do you understand? Okay? Do you understand? Because if it's in Israel and there are different cultures, the religion has to be tolerant and please different factions among the people. Okay? Does that make sense? But once this religion goes off to Babylon, it's now divorced from the people, from local reality. So the elite can design a way that they think is most appropriate. We call that fanatical. Does that make sense? So an example of this, okay, it's a bad analogy, but maybe this will help you. Right now you're not sure what it means to be Chinese. Okay? You're Chinese. But Chinese in China it's a very fluid, very diverse identity. When you go off to America, right, then you have much more concrete, much more clear understanding of what it means to be Chinese. Your Chinese identity becomes much more formed. Does that make sense? Okay? The same thing with religion. Within Israel itself, the religion is constantly changing. It's very fluid. But when they're off to Babylon, they have to use your religion to survive as a people, as an identity. And so it becomes much more formed, much more concrete. Doesn't make sense. And then what happens is as it's now that it's much more concrete, it now interacts with Zoroastrianism, which is the religion of the Persians. And at this point, the religion becomes basically what it is today. So I'm sorry, I don't mean I've explained this clearly to you, but I want to wait until we get to this period. Right now I'm just giving you a broad overview. Any more questions before I begin? Before I continue. All right. Now I want to talk about the Bible, okay? Because the Bible is the mythology, it's a collective memory of the Israelites, okay? And so I'm gonna discuss why the Bible was first created in this class. And what I will explain to you is, the Bible was first created in order to explain and just justify and create legitimacy for David, okay? This is what we call an apology. And this is a very common practice. The idea is this. Most kings, every king, obtains power through really nefarious means. They either kill a lot of people to obtain power, or maybe the younger brother kills the older brother to usurp the throne, okay? Usually kingship requires ruthlessness. rooflessness. But the problem is when you're roofless, you have a legitimacy problem. Right? So the way that most kings resolve this issue is by sponsoring writings, or an apology, to explain why he or she is king. And the answer usually is because God willed it so. Because I have no choice in that matter. I'm not ambitious. I was not at all ambitious. But the circumstances forced my hand. To save my people, to do God's work, I had to kill my brother. I had to kill my enemies. Even though I myself am not a violent person. That's usually how the apology goes. So remember, back at this point, the very idea of writing, it is new, it's a new technology, but it's also a very expensive technology, meaning you need to buy the materials, which are rare. You also need the people to be able to write, okay? And they're also very expensive. You basically needed to be able to support a team of scribes to create any work of fiction. So writing back then is like movie making today. It's a very expensive endeavor that was usually sponsored by the king in order to justify or explain why he is king, why he is king in order to create legitimacy. Does that make sense? So the Bible was created first as an apology for David and explains why the House of David is now in charge of Israel. But as we discussed, eventually the House of David Israel divides into two nations. Now the house of David, the Bible goes with the house of Judah, okay? To Judah. But the northern kingdom now needs its own mythology, its own Bible, right? And so a second Bible was created. The people who are in charge of the Bible, the priest class are interested in promoting their own interests, mainly in the point of ritual. It doesn't make sense? what are rituals, why do we need them, why are priests important. Then you have people at this point in the Babylonian captivity looking back at the history of Israel and trying to figure out why the house of David collapsed. And their answer is because the Israelites refused to follow the will of God because the Israelites became polytheistic or they they became immoral. Does that make sense? In other words, the Bible at this point are divided into like four major factions or schools. The school that supports the House of David, the legitimacy of the House of David is called the J School. Don't worry about this, I'll explain to you in the next class what these things mean. The people who support the the northern kingdom as legitimate house of Israel is called the E school. The school that supports the power of the priests are obviously called the P school, okay? For priests. And then the school that tries to go back in history and examine why Israel fell and which believe it's because they should like to betray God. These people are what we call the D school, okay? The D school. So E, G, P, and D. And these are just four of the major schools. There are other schools as well. All right? And so at this point, the Bible was divided into like four major schools or documents controlled by different factions. When the Persians take over, okay, they insisted, You need one religion, guys. You need one document. And so all four were put together to create the Bible. Well, the way they did it was very interesting. All they did was just put them together, okay? You understand? So if you read the Bible, it's like A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D. Okay? So one line is from the E school. The next line is from the J school, the other line is from the P school. It's very confusing to read. If you don't understand this history, it's impossible for you to read the Bible. I'm not sure if you try to read the Bible, it's not readable. So why would they do this? Why would they just put all four texts together without major editing or revisions? Why? Do you guys know? Why would they do that? I mean, they just made a complete mess of the Bible. But why would they do that? Okay, so let me explain. The first major reason is most people didn't read or write back then. So the Bible itself didn't really matter. What mattered was the oral explanation of a Bible controlled by the priest class. Doesn't make sense. The people didn't read the Bible. So how the Bible was actually written was not that important. It was important for the priests to have access to the Bible. But the people didn't actually read the Bible. That's the first reason. The second more important reason is because the Bible is political real estate. Now I want you to remember this idea. It is the most valuable political real estate in the world. Everyone wants to be in the Bible because to be in the Bible gives you legitimacy. It gives you power. So if you're a king, you have four sons who all wanted to be king, well, your best solution is to divide the kingdom among the four sons, right? Same with the Bible. You have four extremely powerful schools and local factions. So the best way to resolve the issue is just to say, listen, we'll put you all in the Bible together, okay? When you merge them, it's a lot easier than if you just try to do it by order. E school goes first, and J school then P school, then D school. They just put them all together. Does that make sense? So this is a very important idea. The Bible is the most valuable political real estate in the world. Everyone wants to be in there. And what ideas are you can find in there will ultimately shape human history. Any questions so far before I continue? All right, so the last thing I want to talk about today is the Apology of David, which is the beginning of the Bible. So when kings come to power, they have three major problems. The first major problem is legitimacy. gives you the right to be king. Second problem is the idea of identity. And this is a huge problem for the Israelites because the Israelites is a multicultural entity. You have people speaking different languages, different cultures. They practice different cultures, they practice different religions. So now you need to create an identity that everyone accepts. Okay? The The third thing is differentiation. You need not only for these people to get along, but you need to get them to divorce their former culture. Does that make sense? Because you have Egyptian priests in there. You have to tell these to the Egyptian priests. You are now Israelites, and you're not Egyptian anymore. And the example that we use for this is Augustus Caesar and the writing of the Iniad. Remember the Iniad? It's a book about a character named Inias. And it provides political legitimacy to August Caesar, because Augustus Caesar is a direct descendant of Inias, who is the founder of Rome. Also what the Iniad said is Augustus Caesar is the end point of Roman history. Having before Augustus Caesar led to him. Augustus Caesar is like the Jesus of Rome. He has the salvation, he has the redemption of Rome. And that's what the Inean does. Second thing about the Inean is it creates a new Roman identity that focuses on piety, loyalty, over liberty. Remember the problem for Augustus Caesar was Romans in like kings. Well, now he's a king. So how do you get people to obey? What do you tell them? Piety is more important than liberty. All right? Now third idea is the Inaid, remember it's anti-Greek. The problem for Rome at that time was Greek culture was vast superior to Roman culture and so a lot of Romans were adopting Greek cultural practice like Mark Anthony. And so the Inaid said Greek culture is like a Trojan horse. If you let into your city, great culture will corrupt you and destroy you. Okay? So, guess what guys? Every king has to resolve all three issues, okay? Legitimacy, identity, and differentiation. And that's what David is trying to do with the Bible. Okay. So, I'll give you three examples, three stories from the Bible that illustrate David's quest for legitimacy. Next class, we'll talk about identity and differentiation and how the Bible achieves that. But for this class, I want to focus on legitimacy. So now that David is king, a lot of people don't think he's legitimate. Why? Because he ruthlessly tried to usurp the throne from Saul. Saul is the king that everyone picked or elected. And he was a good king. He was good at war. He was someone that most people liked. And David stole the throne from him. So now what is David's problem? Now that he has a throne, others will try to steal it from him. You understand? because if you David are, if you said the president, if you steal the throne, then others are now empowered to steal the throne from you as well. Okay? So the first thing the Bible does, the apology for David does is show us David loves soul. He was not at all ambitious. He cared only for the well-being of his king. Okay? And so one story that illustrates this, there are actually many, many stories in the Bible does this, but once we illustrate this, it's this. So Saul thinks David's trying to kill him. So he's chasing after David with his army, trying to kill David and his followers. One day, Saul is alone in a cave praying to God for deliverance. David sees Saul alone And he sneaks up behind Saul. Then he takes his sword and cuts a piece of Saul's clothing. And then David disappears. Saul leaves the cave, and then David rushes to him and says, Saul, my king, I beg of you, give me a second. Let me explain to you. Back then in the cave, I could have killed you. This is a piece of clothing to prove I could have killed you. But I didn't, because I love you, because I'm loyal to you. I would never kill you. And then Saul says, oh, this is proof that you never meant to kill me. And this is a story in the Bible. Obviously, this story cannot be true. But this is what the Bible is trying to do. It's trying to first show us that David is not all ambitious. In fact, the entire apology of David is focused on the lack of ambition of David. So that's the first story. Let's look at the second story. The second story is this. Saul is dead, and his son, who was a young man, comes into the throne. There's a general named Abner, who was loyal to Saul. But now that Saul is dead, and David is very popular among the people, Abner sees the political winds changing. And Abner tries to align himself with David. So Abner writes a long letter to David and saying, Listen, I will swear loyalty to you and we'll end the civil war between the House of Saul and the House of David. You will unite Israel. And then David writes back and says, yeah, come to me. I'll give you a feast, and then we'll be friends. And so Abner comes, David gives him a feast. And then as Abner leaves, he runs into David's general named Joab. Joab. And Joab and Abner go a long way back, okay? There were friends, there were enemies. Abner killed Joab's brother. And in an act of anger, Joab stabs Abner to death. And Abner is dead. And once Abner is dead, the house of soul basically gives up and David is able to unite Israel. Okay, now it's the soul in the Bible. David is so angry by this that he curses Joel and he gives Abner a great funeral, right? Because David does not want to betray his friends. Why is this story wrong or completely made up? It's not made up, but it's what we call spin, right? Clearly, Abner and David had a feast together, and clearly Joab killed Abner. But why is the Bible version of this event wrong or incorrect? It can't be true. You guys know? OK, this is hard, OK? But the reason is this. If you're David and you're king, which person in the world are you most afraid of? If you're the king, there's a person in this world you're most afraid of or you're most suspicious of. Who is that person? Hmm? Abner. Okay, yeah, he is suspicious of Abner, but in general, you should be suspicious of Joab, right? Because Joab has access to your army. Abner's your enemy, but Joab has access to your army. So if Joab wants to betray you, he could, okay? So in other words, because David is most suspicious of Joab, if Joab were ever to act independently, Then David would need to kill him. Does that make sense? And in this circumstance, Joab acted independently. David told Joab, Abner was an honored guest. And Joab didn't care. He was angry about the death of his brother, and he kills Abner. This cannot possibly be true. You understand? Joab had to kill Abner because he was ordered to by David, right? Now, why would David want Abner to be killed? Because in his mind he thinks, oh, if America can betray the House of Saul, he can also betray the House of David. He is an ambitious man. And why would he think like that? Why would David come to this conclusion? Because he himself is like that. Do you understand? He himself betrayed Saul. So he's very, very careful or cautious about people who betrayed their leaders. Abner betrayed the House of Saul, and it was very likely that he would betray David at some point as well. And so David had to have him killed. But he could not say this publicly. Because if you were to say this publicly, they would show he, in fact, knew this because he betrayed Saul. Does that make sense? the logic of this. But you can see how wonderful the spin is. It's almost impossible to see the truth from this. If you're a person, you know, OK, David, you know that Job killed Abner. And you would tell the story. You'd believe the story. It's just because Abner was angry that he killed. Sorry, it was just because Job was angry. He killed Abner. You'd believe that. When you think about it, it can't be true. Now I'm going to give you one more story. And this story is actually even harder to figure out because of the spin. Now that David is king of Israel, Israel has many enemies. So his armies are always at war. One day, David is on the rooftop of his house. And Israel is not a very rich place. So these are not palaces. They're just houses. So David is strolling on his rooftop and across from him is a woman named Bathsheba. Bathsheba. And she's bathing naked. And David is overcome with lust. He's like, I must have this woman. Okay, and he's king. He orders his servant to go get her. She comes, they have sex. Okay, the problem is, we have sex, but she gets pregnant. Okay? The problem now is, but she was married to a man named Urea, the Hittite. And Urea the Hittite is one of David's best soldiers, and he's fighting for David and Israel somewhere else. So David's like, oh, this is a problem, because once Urea comes home and he finds but she has a new child, he's going to know it's not his. So either he's going to kill her, or he's going to figure out it's David to come kill him. So David, being very clever, has a solution to this. He invites Uriah back home. So Uriah comes home from the war, and Uriah thinks, oh, the king has called for me. Therefore, it's an emergency. So he rushes back. And David meets Uriah at his house. And David says, listen, Uriah, you're just doing such a great job. You're such a great soldier. You're so loyal. I want to give you a vacation. Go home and be with your wife. And you're just like, my king, my comrades are dying. They're starving out in the battlefield. I cannot abandon them. How can I find pleasure in my wife when my friends are suffering? I refuse to go home. I will not go home until the battle is won. And David tries his best, but he can't convince Yuria to go home. So then David tells Yuria, you're such a great soldier. You're so loyal. I'm so happy and proud that you fight for me. And he gives Yuria a letter to his general Joab, OK? And the letter instructs Joab to kill Yuria. Joab will send Yuria with his soldiers out in the battlefield. And then at the last minute, Job will recall his soldiers leaving Job by himself. At this point, the enemies will swarm Urea and kill Urea. That's what happens. And once Urea is dead, David marries Pashiba. And they're about to have a child together. At this point, David is visited by a prophet named Nathan. And Nathan says to David, I want to ask you a question. And David says, sure, go ahead. Nathan says, let's imagine there are two shepherds. There's a rich shepherd with 100 sheep, and there's a poor shepherd with two sheep. There's a traveler, a foreign guest, who comes into town, and the rich shepherd wants to honor him with a feast. The rich shepherd steals the poor man's shepherd to feed the traveler. Who's in the wrong? And David says, of course the rich shepherd is in the wrong. He's indignant. He's angry. How could a man be so unrighteous as to steal another man's sheep? And then David says, you, David, are the rich shepherd. You have violated God's law. You are in the wrong. And as punishment, God will take away your son or your child with Bathsheba. And that's what happens. And David goes into mourning. He's distraught, he's depressed, and he writes a lot of poetry. Okay, so this is a very powerful story. And this is a story that has captured the imagination of everyone for thousands of years. But it's complete spin. This is not happening. How do we know? Okay, first thing is this. Nathan says to David, you have stolen a man's wife. Therefore you are in the wrong. What's the problem with logic? What is David's crime? Real crime. Guys, he killed Uriah. You understand? You've forgotten this fact. He had Uriah killed. That's a real crime. He killed Uriah. Yeah, he's up with Pashiba. That's bad. But it's much worse if you murder someone. So another question then is, why would he murder Uriah? Why not just talk to him honestly and say, Uriah, I'm sorry, I love your wife. I had sex with her, I'm sorry. Why did he have to get Uriah killed? Why was Uriah killed? Yeah, because the army is loyal to Uriah, right? So why would David fear Uriah? Because Uriah is a popular brave soldier, just like David. And David uses popularity in order to usurp the throne from Saul, right? Therefore David thinks Uriah could do the same thing to me. Therefore I have to get him killed. In other words, this specific thing must have come later to disguise the fact that David killed Uriah because he feared Uriah's popularity. Does that make sense? Right? You see how clever this story is? The circle of truth must have been David feared Uriah's popularity, and he needed to get rid of Uriah. So he concocted this plan, and then after he killed Uriah, he needed to explain to his army, okay, who loved Uriah why this happened. And then there was like, oh, because I fell in love with his wife. I couldn't control myself. I'm just a man, okay? God is God. I'm a man. I'm a king. I can't be God. I can't control my emotions. Does that make sense? But the irony of this is because David is working so hard to disguise his ruthlessness, he's creating very powerful literature. He created a very powerful story that has captured the imagination of leaders for a long time. And you think about it, you think a lot about the story, it unleashes a lot of ideas in you. Okay? You have to ask yourself, what is man? What is God? Are we capable of controlling our emotions? So in other words, this story is extremely well constructed that inspires you to imagine your own personal and emotional and moral life. We call this literature, right? So, guys, it's no coincidence that today the Jewish people are the most creative people in the world. When you go to America for university, most of your professors are Jewish. Most of the best thinkers in the world are Jewish. These past 200 years, there have been three revolutionary thinkers, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, and Simon Freud, they're all Jewish, who are stepped, who have been raised in the Jewish tradition of asking deep questions about what it means to be human. Does that make sense? Okay, any questions about this? Okay, that's a great question, okay? So the question is why would people believe this apology of David? And well, the answer is most didn't believe the party of David, okay? Most were very clear about David's ambitions. But when you're king, you need to impose your reality on others, okay? So this is why this is written. And so it was written for people who were part of David's political coalition, you understand? His enemies wouldn't believe this, right? But it was basically meant to appease or convince those who want to believe David. Does that make sense? Spin. And it happens today, guys. When you watch the news, it's spin. It's the story of reality. And so most people will believe the media. There are some people who will never believe the media. I don't believe anything the media tells me, whether it's Chinese media or American media. I know a lot of history to understand the media is distorting reality. But most people will believe this because they have absolutely no interest in not believing it. David's king, if you don't believe it, then you have to believe your king is a murderer. Does that make sense? Yeah? Yeah, Echo? Oh, yeah. That's a great question. Yeah, this is really important. What's the mainstream understanding of the story? So the mainstream understanding of the story is, it has to be true. Why? Because it puts David in a bad light. You understand? And it shows the genius of David. Because David is wrestling with his own morality. David is being honest. All right? So the mainstream understanding is, David is a port king. He's a man who prays constantly and engage in the process of self-reflection. And that's what makes David great. He's constantly praying to God. In fact, the Bible just goes on endlessly about this, how David is constantly in communication with God. And in this communication, he's praying and asking for light for truth in his own weaknesses, okay? To be delivered from his failings as a man. And the Bathsheba story is epimantic about this, Because why would a man make this up, right? Well, I've told you why, but most scholars don't see that. Most scholars think, okay, well, but Shippa's story puts David in the worst possible light, therefore it must be true, and therefore it shows us David is a poor king who is constantly thinking about his own moral failings. And so he's an inspiration to his people. Okay, that's the mainstream understanding. Any other questions? Yep, that's right. Oh, okay. So the question is, if people at that time were mainly illiterate, why was this written down? Or how would they know the story? So the idea is this. First of all, this was written for the elite, for the people around David to know what story to tell people. Doesn't make sense. So this was for internal consumption. And this was to basically preserve David's historical legacy. So maybe 20 years from now, when everyone's dad, when people who knew Uriah and Bathsheba were dad, well, what is truth now? The truth is what's been written down. That's what they're saying. History is written by the writers. History is not written by the winners. History is written by the writers. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Okay, great. So next class, we'll continue the Hebrew Bible, okay? Because it starts off as an apology for David, but it evolves into a much larger mythology. Right?

This morning we are doing the Protestant Reformation and I will explain to you how it gave birth to capitalism. This class, it's going to be hard conceptually because we are going to take concepts we learned before and combine them to help explain the world we live in today. So if there's anything I'm saying that's not clear or confusing or debatable, please interrupt me, okay? interupt me, okay? All right, so I wanna make sure that you can follow the logic clearly, okay? So first of all, what I will do is explain the three major differences between the Protestant religion and the Catholic religion, okay? So let's look at Catholic first. In many ways, the Protestant religion is a response to the problems created by the Catholic religion, okay? So there are three main characteristics about the Catholic religion. The first is the idea of orthodoxy or dogma. So there's a set of beliefs in the Catholic religion that you must memorize. You're not allowed to question it. You're not allowed to interpret it. You must memorize it. And what maintains the orthodoxy is the idea of hierarchy. So only priests and the ordained, those sanctioned by the Catholic Church, have access to the Bible. Only they can interpret the Bible properly. They are favored by God. The Pope is God's official representative on earth. Okay, so that's the idea of hierarchy. The last concept is the idea of justification by works. Okay? And the idea here is if you want to be saved, you have to engage in proper rituals. You have to do what the church tells you. Your actions matter more than your beliefs. Okay? Now as we discussed in previous classes, these three main concepts that underpin the Catholic church, they will create problems. Okay? So just for this reason by works, it creates a problem of hypocrisy. The idea here is it'd be nice if you believed in God, it'd be nice if you believed in what you were doing, but you don't have to. As long as you do what you're told, you can still go to heaven. It creates a hypocrisy, and obviously there are a lot of people who are opposed to this. All right hierarchy creates a problem of corruption There's no real mechanism to prevent the priests from abusing their powers and as we discussed last week the priests do engage in a lot of corruption and Abuses okay The problem of Ophelaxi is it creates this connection, right? And the idea here is that that ever since the dawn of human history, we humans are fundamentally religious. Our fundamental, our first and foremost need is to connect with God, to be with God, to work with God, and to access God, okay? And that's, and because of these three problems, disconnection, corruption, hypocrisy, there's always been dissent, there's always been rebellion against the Catholic Church in Europe. And last we discussed the cathars, the walledicians. So this has been an ongoing issue in the Catholic Church. So the Protestant religion was developed in response to these problems. So let's look at the three major responses of the Protestant religion. The first response to Orthodoxy is direct access. You don't need the priest to tell you what the Bible means. You can just read it by yourself. In fact, God wills that you talk to him directly by reading the Bible, okay? If that is the case, then the church must be fundamentally egalitarian. Because if everyone can access God, then everyone is equal in the eyes of God. But the fundamental demand now is justification by faith. by faith. You have to truly believe in God. You must develop your life around this faith in God. So on one hand, the Protestant religion is solving a lot of problems created by the church. But on the other hand, it's also creating a lot of problems as well. So let's go very quickly over some of the major problems. And it's just vacation by faith. It creates a problem of anxiety. Why? Because how do you know you truly believe in God? Does that make sense? How do you really know you have faith? You have to constantly prove to yourself that you truly believe in God through actions, through works. Okay? You have to raise doubt in your mind. And this makes you anxious. makes you antique, okay? So that's one huge problem created by the Protestant religion. The second big problem is a problem of diversity. If everyone is equal, then everyone can start his or her own religion. And what we'll see during the Protestant Reformation is an explosion of different religions with all different sets of beliefs. There's only one Catholic church, But there's like tens of thousands of possible denominations. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? All right. So then with direct access, you are forced to have literacy. Okay? You are forced to educate yourself. All right? And this is a good thing, right? But it's also a problem because if you're poor, you may not have access to education. All right? So this is a problem for a lot of people. And that's why in the beginning of the development of Protestantism, most of the adherents to this new religion are actually the aspiration of middle class. The people of some means, there are people who want to aspire to more wealth. So this is the basic rundown of the differences between the Protestant religion and the Catholic religion. All right? Are you clear about this? Any questions so far? Is this clear to you? Okay. All right. So now I'm going to go deeper, explain the problems that this new religion creates in the minds of the faithful. Okay? The faithful. All right. Okay. So the problem The problem that it within the Christian religion as we discussed in previous classes is the idea of the Holy Trinity. The Holy Trinity. The idea of the Holy Trinity is that Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit, these are different forces that are independent of each other, but they are equal to each other and they are part of the same thing. So for the human mind, the way that our human minds are designed, it's impossible for us to understand this concept of the Holy Trinity. It's like saying that this pen, it is here and not here. Your mind has to believe that this thing is here and not here. And your mind can't do that, okay? Your mind has to believe in one thing and it cannot believe in contradictions. But this is inherently a contradiction. The only way that our mind can process this is by believing that this is a symbol. The reason why is that this is something, the only way that we can understand the Holy Trinity is to believe that it is both nothing and everything. And that's what a symbol is. A symbol is nothing that represents everything depending on how you perceive it. The problem with this is that It creates the problem of anxiety, right? Anxiety. Why does it create anxiety? Because again, our fundamental need is to connect with God. The concept of the Holy Trinity means that we can never truly connect with God. It is a symbol, it is an abstraction removed from us. We never be intimate with God. It's either away from us or through us. But we can never touch it, we can never feel it, okay? This creates anxiety. Before this was not a problem because the church stood between you, the believer, and the Holy Trinity. All you had to do was believe in the church and you were fine. But then what happens if you're with the church? Now you have to grasp, try to grasp what the Holy Trinity is. And again, remember, one of the main ideas of the Protestant religion is that you must struggle with your faith. You must recognize and fully realize your faith in God. Otherwise, you'll be condemned to hell. But as we already discussed, there's holy trinity that is impossible to understand. So this creates anxiety. Now, the thing about anxiety is it creates the problem of like OCD, okay? Obsessive, compulsive behavior. Because anxiety comes about because of confusion, okay? What you want to do is remove this anxiety by ordering your physical world, right? People with obsessive compulsive behavior, what do they do? They like to clean houses. They like to buy things. They like to lose weight. They're trying to order. The word we use is rationalized. They're trying to rationalize the world around them in order to reduce your anxiety. Does that make sense? Have you studied obsessive compulsive behavior? OCD. It's cost my anxiety, and this anxiety forces you to try to rationalize the world. Now, there's also a third problem in the Protestant religion. And it's the idea of double free destination. OK, so this is a big concept, but it's very easy to understand. If you remove the church, because the church is too corrupt, the problem arises like, how do you know if you're going to heaven or not? Who's going to the side? And so a man, a theologian by the name of John Coven, he proposed the idea of double predestination. And the idea here is this, God at the beginning of time has already decided. And this decision is final. You cannot persuade him that he is wrong because he is perfect, eternal and immutable. And only a few, the elect will be saved. will be saved. Only these people will be allowed to go to heaven. Everyone else will be condemned to hell. And who are the elect? The elect are those who truly believe that they have been saved. Only those who truly believe in God's mercy, in God's grace, will be saved. Okay? If you think about it, this creates even more anxiety because how do you know if you're one to save? You have to work hard now to solve this problem. Okay? So let's summarize. Because of the Protestant religion, you have three new problems created. The first is the individual believer cannot understand the whole eternity, but they must. That's what the religion demands. That's the first problem. Second problem is the anxiety causes OCD which makes them want to rationalize the world. It makes them want to order the world according to their faith. That's the second issue. The third issue is the idea of double predestination that which says that if you do not truly believe in God, if you do not actually figure out the grace of God, then you'll be condemned to eternal damnation. So these are the three major problems created by the Protestant religion. And so over time, and this is a process that will take decades, centuries, they figure out a solution. They figure out a solution. And the solution is this. The solution is money. The solution is money. That's how you resolve these three paradoxes or three contradictions, three anxieties. Alright, so first of all, let me explain what money is. Okay? Money. Alright, so in the world we are all different. We have different perspectives, okay? So each individual is unique, each individual is different, each individual sees the world differently. And this creates confusion. This creates problems. And I ask you why you're in school. You might say, oh, I'm here to learn mathematics. I might ask someone else, oh, I want to go to America for college. Another person might be like, I want to learn. Each person is different. But what happens is this. If I introduce that concept of money, what it does is it standardizes, systemizes, clarifies, and simplifies everyone's understanding into one concept, into a coherent whole. So let me use an experiment to show you why this is true. So some experimenters, they gave everyone a wine test. They put three different bottles of wine in front each person, ask each person to taste the wine and then ask each person which wine is the best. And most people could not tell the difference. They were different. These are different parts of wine but they didn't know which one was better. Then what the experimenters did was they put price tags on each part of wine. Okay? $10, $20, $50. And then when the experimenters did this, everyone knew, oh, of course the $50 bottle of wine is better, okay? So that's what money does. Money allows us to simplify the world in order to understand it. So all our beliefs, our values, our judgment now is placed into this one symbol, money. But then what happens is we then take this money and we reshape the world according to money. Okay, does that make sense? Now I ask you, why are you going to school? Everyone's like, to make money in the future. Everyone agrees on this, okay? So that's what money is. Money is a system to sterilize everyone's thought. And then once the sterilization happens, it reshapes reality into a rational order. Okay, does that make sense? All right, okay, so let's go back. Okay, now that we understand what money is, we can now explain how money reduces the paradoxes. Right? Money is a way for people to rationalize the world. You're anxious? What do you do to reduce this anxiety? Make money, make more money. Don't stop until you make the most money, okay? Then money is a way to resolve the God issue. Because money is also a symbol. So what you can do mentally is conflate God with money. Money is God, God is money. That makes sense to people, right? And now, because you've conflated God of money, You can now solve the predestination problem, which is like, oh, how do I know I have faith in God? Because I have a lot of money. Because I spend my entire life accumulating money. And how do I know I'm going to have it? Because I'm rich. My wealth shows that I have true faith in God. If I have true faith in God, then I must be one of those predestined by God to be the elect. And therefore, I have nothing to worry about. And because of this, the beauty of this system is this. It creates a concept of capitalism. Never before in human history have people believed that this was a good thing, that you should go accumulate money for the sake of accumulating money. Before, it was always about accumulating money in order to increase your social status. So wealthy people would always spend their money holding community fees on giving money to the poor, helping the community. So remember Julius Caesar when he died, he was the wealthiest man in the world, but he gave a third of his money to the poor people of Rome. He gave a third of his money to building parks for Rome. And the final third went to, is adopted here, Octavian. But now what's important is that you try to accumulate as much money as possible. Don't waste it because if you waste it it's corruption. It shows you lack of faith in God. And that's why we have capitalism because of the anxiety created by the Protestant Reformation. And again, this is a process that will take centuries. It doesn't happen right away. But it's a process that takes centuries and it's a process that will define the world we live in today. Okay? Even though today, most people actually not Protestant, most people do not believe in double predestination, most people don't really understand the whole eternity, most people don't want to rationalize the world, we have absorbed this mentality. Okay? We believe that we should accumulate money for the sake of accumulating money. That's why where we worship people like Jack Ma, Ellen Musk, Jeff Bezos. Even though we think about it, they've just accumulated a symbol, right? The money is actually nothing. But we worship them because we believe that money is reality itself. That's what capitalism is. Capitalism is a belief that money is reality in itself. All right, so I know conceptually this is hard, and this is a lot, And now what I will do is explain historical context and explain the evidence for this argument. But first, I want to make sure that this argument is clear to you. This is a thesis, OK? This is an explanation as to why you have capitalism today. So any questions before I explain the historical context? This is all clear? OK, good. All right. So now what I'm going to do is explain the historical context as well as provide the evidence. So the process of reformation. So the process of reformation is a process that took place from 1517. 1517 is when the theologian Martin Luther published his 95 thesis. The 95 thesis is a direct criticism of the Catholic Church, the corruption of the Catholic Church. And it ends really in the year 1648. This is after decades of violent warfare between the Prostates and the Catholics. And at this point, Europe is completely exhausted. They just finished fighting something called a 30 years war, which is before World War I, the deadest war in European history. It kills at most about 8 million people. So all of Europe is completely devastated. In certain parts of Germany, which is where the war was fought, they lost about half of their population. And this war ended in something called the Treaty of Westphalia, the Peace of Westphalia, which guarantees religious freedom to everyone in Europe. And this ends the process of reformation. So again, historians state the beginning of the Protestant Reformation to Martin Luther. Last week we discussed the Crusades and we discussed how there were many thinkers, theologians who opposed the Catholic Church. People like John Wycliffe, Jerry and Haas, and they were eventually condemned as heretics and the rebellion was stumped out by the Catholic Church. But Martin Luther, he's fortunate in that he has powerful political patrons. the various princes of the Holy Roman Empire want more autonomy from the Catholic Church. And Martin Luther gives them a proper pretext in order to financially divorce themselves from the Catholic Church, okay? So as I've discussed, what he's most famous for is something called the 95 Thesis, which is a direct criticism of the corruption of the Catholic Church. At this time, the Catholic Church wanted to build St. Peter's Basilica, a church in the Vatican. And they wanted this to be a gorgeous building. So to finance the building of this church, the Catholic Church saw something called indulgences. Indulgences are basically like tickets or special letters that will reduce the punishment of your relatives in purgatory, okay? It's basically to reduce the number of sins you committed. It's basically like bribing God to reduce your penalty. And this was a very popular thing. And allow the Pope to build St. Peter's Basilica, which is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world today. But as you can imagine, if you are a true Christian, you are insulted, you're offended, you're angered by the idea of this corruption. So the 95 thesis or 95 sentences in which Martin Luther lays out his case against indulgences and as such against the authority of the church and the pope. And this is the argument he makes. So let's look at some sentences. So the 36 sentence is, every truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, even without letters of pardon. And what he's saying here is the idea of salvation by faith. You don't have to spend this money. You don't have to do what the church tells you. If you are a true Christian, if you truly believe in God, God will forgive you. You have direct access to God. So he's denying the authority of the pope, which makes him a heretic. He also says, Christians are to be taught that the pope in granting pardons needs and therefore desires, they're devout prayer for him more than the money they bring. This is the right insult to the Pope. He's saying like, the person that most offends God in this world is the Pope. Because the Pope is insulting God by telling the world that God can be bribed by money. So let's pray for the Pope. Because clearly the Pope has offended God. He also says, why does not the Pope whose wealth is today greater than the riches of the riches. He's saying the Pope is the richest man in Europe. Why doesn't the Pope spend this money and build the church himself? Build just this one church of St. Peter with his own money rather than with the money of poor believers. Why is he exploiting the poor when he is the richest man in the world? As you can see, and as you can imagine, the church is furious with him. And they demonize heretic, and they want to burn him at the stake. But again, he's protected by powerful political patrons, and they fight a war over this issue. And it ends with something called the Peace of Augsburg, which divides the Holy Roman Empire, Germany, into Lutheran areas, where they're free to believe in Lutheran and Catholic areas where they still adhere to the pope. Okay? So this is the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther starts this doctrinal debate and John Calvin also contributes to it by introducing the idea of double predestination. All right? So Martin Luther, he wants to reform the church. And then he eventually realizes that he needs to build another church. But John Calvin, with his idea of double predestination, he's trying to deny the authority of the church. He's telling people that because God has already decided who will go to heaven at the beginning of time and the church is lying to you. The church is fooling you, deluding you. So he's a Frenchman, he went to the subordinate of the University of Paris and as you can imagine, he's deemed a heretic and he flees to a place called Geneva in Switzerland. And Switzerland is one of the birthplaces of the Protestant Reformation. The reason why is there are a lot of independent towns in Switzerland. And as I mentioned, the first believers in the Protestant religion are actually townspeople that aspirational middle class. They want to connect with God and they want a religion that encourages them to achieve more in life. and that's what the Protestant religion is about. There's also another famous theologian that's really not discussed today, but he's considered one of the three major founders of Protestantism, his name is Erich Zingli, and he's based in Zurich, okay? And he's probably the most extreme of the three. Okay, all right. So the Protestant Reformation, it opens a kind of warmth, it opens a penultimate box, Because before, the ultimate authority was the Pope, who represented God. But now, you're free to believe whatever you want. So there are lots of peasants who rebelled against nobility, because they thought that feudalism was evil in the eyes of God. So this is a proto-communist movement. These are people who wanted total equality and democracy and freedom in the world because they believe that is the will of God. So they rebel against the feudal lords that killed them. And then the entire monarchy unite, the Asarkar say unite, because they see these peasants as a threat. Now there are lots of these peasants, we estimate maybe about 300,000 joining this rebellion, but they are not educated, they are not organized, They have no weapons, and they have no centralized authority. And therefore, they're all massacred by the aristotic armies, OK? So this is the peasants' war. And this is important because eventually we will discuss communism. And communism will be developed in response to the peasants' war, OK? So this is the deadliest massacre of peasants before the French Revolution. 1534 is the act of supremacy. That is when the king of England, Henry VIII, declares his independence from the pope. But because there's such a strong Catholic contingent in England, Henry VIII maintains Catholic practices. But rather than have the pope be at the head of the church, he himself is now head of the church. It's called the Church of England now. And the religion is called the Anglican religion. The Anglican religion. So the thing that we should observe about the classroom reformation is that, first of all, it's extremely diverse. There are lots of different denominations. The Lutherans are those who believe in Martin Luther. The Calvinists are those who believe in double predestination. The Anglicans are English who still follow Catholic rituals, but rather than follow the Pope, they follow the king of England. The Hussites are those who adhere to Jane Huss in Bohemia. The Unitarians are interesting. The Unitarians are those who deny the divinity of Jesus. They deny the holy trinity. God is God, and Jesus is just the Messiah. He's just a prophet of God. So they affirm the moral teachings of Jesus, but they deny his divinity. You also have the Anabattas. The Anabattas are interesting as well because they believe that to truly believe in God, you must choose to do so. Therefore, you must not baptize infants. Because when you do so, you force children to believe in God, even though they themselves lack the capacity, lack the reason to believe in God. So only adults can join the faith, and they must do so voluntarily. So as you can see, there's tremendous divergence, there's tremendous diversity within the Protestant faith, and it still continues today. Every day you have new denominations opening up because people are interpreting the Bible differently. Another thing that you will notice is that most of the Protestants are actually located in northern Europe. So the countries of England, Germany, the Nordic countries, Switzerland, they will go to the Protestant. And in the south, France, Spain, Italy, they will remain Catholic. The only exception is this, the south of France. The south of France. of France will turn protested. It's interesting for us because if you look at a map, okay, the present French are heavily centered in the south of France. And if you remember from last week, that's where the cathars are also located, okay. So some historians believe that Protestantism and Catholicism, they sort of mingle together. They combine and and became conflated together. Other historians believe that it's because that culturally, the south of France, because it's surrounded by mountains, it's always been culturally independent of the rest of French. They speak a local language called Provenceau, which is different from French. These Protestants in France, sorry, these Protestants in France, They're mainly in the middle class. They're extremely well educated. They become very prosperous. And they're joined by the nobility. And as such, the king of France, and France is right now the most powerful country in Europe, the king of France sees them as a threat. And so what he'll do is he'll kill some of the nobles which launches the Saint Barthelomeu Days Massacre in 1572. That's a day when tens of thousands of French Protestants called Huguenots were killed. And this was sort of process by which these Huguenots extremely educated, extremely hardworking, extremely wealthy, they will move to Protestant countries like England and the Netherlands and Germany. And they will help these countries jump start the Industrial Revolution, okay? They will bring their expertise and they will help these countries jump start the Industrial Revolution. So this is a tremendous loss for France, tremendous gain for the other Protestant nations. Okay, so eventually Europe is divided into two major factions, the Catholic faction and the Protestant faction. And these two factions will eventually engage in something called the Thirty Years War, okay, between the Hasburgs, the Holy Roman Empire, which is supported by the Pope, versus basically the independent states of Germany, okay. And this is a war that will last exactly 30 years. And again, it will kill at most 8 million people. It's the deadliest war in European history up until World War I. What's interesting about this war is that France, which is Catholic, chooses to join the Protestants in this war because they see the Holy Roman Empire as an imperial threat. They're afraid that if they allow the Habsburgs to take over Germany, then eventually they will swap up France. So it was a religious war, but it was also a geopolitical and imperial war. And again, this war ends with the Treaty of Westphalia, which guarantees religious freedom in Europe. So the religious wars will end, and Protestant religion will not be free to develop independently. So this is called the Peace of Westphalia. Okay, so now let's summarize and let's discuss the evidence for my argument that the Protestant Reformation gave birth to capitalism. So these are the three major differences between the Catholic religion and the Protestant religion. The question then is, why is it that the North will become really Protestant and the South of Europe will stay mainly Catholic? So one thing that we discussed in this class is the persistence of culture. So, again, no one knows why this is the case, okay? And you'll hear different arguments. It could have been weather, it could have been personality, it could have been a lot of different factors, okay? But one possibility I want to present to you today is the cultural factor, which is that the South of France and the North of France are culturally different, all right? So, let's look at South of France. Sorry, South of Europe. The Southern Europe countries of Spain, France and Italy were heavily influenced by Roman culture. That's where the Roman Empire was based, right? The Roman Empire eventually became an imperial bureaucracy. There are three core values to the Romans, right? Liberty. Now, liberty is really important. It means obedience to the law. Because only by obeying the law can people be free to do what they want, okay? Secondly, it's the idea of republica. Republica means public virtue. to serve the public good, which basically means obeying what the Senate tells you to do, obeying authority. And the last is the idea of piety, which is to respect the customs and history and traditions of Rome. So these are the three major values of the Romans. And we can believe that they became embedded in the South of Europe. Now let's look at Viking culture. And when I say Vikings, I don't really mean Vikings per se. What I really mean are those proto-Indo-Europeans that never really assimilated into Roman culture. All right, so what are their values? Well, they believe in courage, they believe in loyalty, and they believe in resourcefulness, okay? And we discuss this when we discuss the Vikings. Now, what we're gonna do is this. We're gonna map Catholic belief with Romans, and we're gonna map Viking belief with the Protestants and see what happens. Okay, so the Catholics, they believe in Orthodoxy, right? Well, the Romans also believe in Orthodoxy. They call it liberty, right? Obedience to laws. Don't question laws, just obey them. Catholics believe in hierarchy. Well, Romans believe in hierarchy as well. They believe in obeying the Senate. The Senate is the ultimate authority, right? Catholics believe in justification by works. The Romans believe in piety, right? Respecting tradition. You don't have to believe in these traditions, but you must respect them, right? So this is pretty close. I mean, it's not perfect. All right? But this suggests that Roman culture had a tremendous influence on development of the Catholic Church. Now let's look at the Protestants. They believed in direct access to God through the Bible. Well, the Vikings believed in courage. What is courage? Courage is self-exploration to go out in the unknown and figure out things for yourself. And that's what the Bible is. That's what faith is. To read the Bible for yourself and to interpret the Bible in your own way. And you have to do so using emotional and spiritual courage. All right? It got a tyrannism. So the Vikings had a concept of loyalty. And loyalty is basically the idea of mutual love. I'm loyal to you and you're loyal back to me because we love each other. All right? And the last concept is justification by faith. And the individual struggle to come to terms with what God means to you individually, okay? And the Vikings believed in resourcefulness, right? which is also the idea of individual struggle. You can figure out by yourself if you work hard enough, if you will yourself, if you have the courage to do so. Okay, so again, I leave this as a possibility. Okay, don't treat this as a historical fact. I just suggest as a way to think about why the Protestants became Protestants, the Catholics became Catholics. And a lot has to do with the cultural residue from the past. Okay, so this is just a thought experiment. All right, so let's now talk about why is it that the Protestant Reformation won out. Again, they were up against the Holy Roman Empire, they were up against Catholic Church. There were more people in Catholic Europe, Catholic Europe was wealthier and stronger, but they still won, okay? And the reason why they won is due to the invention of three things. The first thing is the printing press, which allowed for mass literacy and education. Now, everyone could read the Bible. Before, you couldn't do so. You couldn't afford a Bible. But now, everyone can read the Bible. But not only that, but everyone can now become self-educated. You can read all the classics by yourself. And the Protestant religion compelled you to be literate and to be educated. And as such, the Protestants as a whole were more well-educated than the Catholics. That's the first way in the printing press. Second reason is the musket. This is really important. Before the main weapon, the ultimate weapon was a knight, the armor knight. And the armor knight was a professional soldier, right? And that's where the knights were the nobility. Because they spent all the time training for war, going to war, fighting wars. And it's very expensive to be a knight. But now eventually you have the gun, the musket. And it takes about 60 days for anyone to learn how to use the musket. And the musket is, the thing about the musket that's really important is it's able to pierce the armor of the knight, which makes the knight useless in war now, okay? It's a musket that is important. So in other words, anyone who has courage and devotion, mainly the Protestants, they're able to fight a war. And the musket will be vital, it'll be crucial for both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. And we'll discuss the musket when we get to the American Revolution and the French Revolution. And last thing is that you have back notes. Before people use gold or coins that were mitted with gold in order to trade goods. Not only you can use back notes, which is just money. And you can now monetize your hard work and frugality. You can now channel your hard work and frugality into back notes. What's really important now is there's only a finite number of gold and coins, right? But there's an infinite source of back notes. So you can work infinitely hard, okay? So what this means is before the Protestant Reformation, it was really hard to get people to work hard because let's just say that you are an employer and you wanna be like, okay, I'm gonna pay people more, Right? But when you pay people more, they actually work less. Because they can't spend that money. They're like, well, you know, if I have to work eight hours a day to make a hundred dollars, but now I have to work two hours a day to make a hundred dollars, I'll just make, I'll just make, I'll just work two hours. So we actually work less. And in this system, slavery makes sense. Because the way to get people to work hard is to force them into eternal debt, which is what slavery is. But in this new Protestant system, then slavery is an evil. We should deny people the capacity to be with God, right? You are with God if you work hard, but if you're a slave, how do you measure the hard work? You're not able to work hard. And that's why after Protestant Reformation, one of the main things that they did was eventually all slavery. So there are lots of good things about the Protestant Reformation. You have the Industrial Revolution, You have the end of slavery. You have the rise of capitalism. You have the rise of the middle class. You have lots of really good things. But there's also no denying that there are some bad effects as well, okay? All right. So this is a printing press made by Gutenberg. This is what a printing press looks like. You have the musketeer, okay? So before people had bows, right? And the bows were used by trained archers And they weren't that powerful. But now with the musket, you're able to pierce night armor because there's more energy, 3,100 joules within the bullet. And then you have banknotes as well. And banknotes really is the exception of wealth, which means that in theory now, you could have infinite wealth. Why are we so wealthy today? because we abstracted wealth. Before, wealth was limited because gold was limited. But now with banknotes with money, in theory, wealth can be infinite. So this is John Wesley, who is the founder of the Methodist Church. And he summarizes the idea of positive really well. We ought not to prevent people from being diligent and frugal. We must exhort all Christians to gain all they can and to save all they can. That is an effect to go rich. So, the Protestant believe that it is God's calling. It is your mission to get rich. And that's how you know that you're favored by God. And the way to get rich is by working hard and not spending any money. Okay, so what I'm gonna do now is present the evidence for my argument by the Protestant religion gave birth to capitalism. And to do so, I'm gonna refer to three major thinkers, Max Weber, Emel Durkheim, and George Simmel. They're all sociologists. They're considered three major founders of the social sciences. And they're all contemporaries. They were all writing about the year 1900. What is important is the year 1900 is really when the Protestant religion is most tri-invent. This is when capitalism is most dominant. Even though most people are not Protestants, Protestant, the work ethic, the belief system has conquered the world. Germany, Britain, United States are the three most powerful countries in the world at this time. They're the three largest empires and they're all Protestant nations. And as such, they can impose Protestant beliefs on everyone else, okay? And in the year 1900, it's also before World War I. So at this time, everyone thinks that this is the greatest thing in the world. Protestantism, industrial revolution, capitalism are all divinely sent by God to bless humanity, okay? And what Max Weber, George Simmel, and Emile Durkheim are trying to do, is figure out what's really going on, okay? And to see if there are any consequences to the system. And what they will show us is, in fact, there are a lot of problems in this system, okay? So let's first look at Max Weber, who in 1904 to 1905, from 1905, he wrote something called the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. He's trying to explain why is it that Prans are a lot wealthier than Catholics in general, okay? And this is what he has to say. So far, predestination was not reinterpreted, toned down, or fundamentally abandoned. So remember, double predestination. To believe that God has already selected those who will go to heaven, and you must prove to yourself that you are one of them. Two principle mutually connected types of pastoral advice appear. So there are two consequences to the idea of predestination. On the one hand, it is held to be an absolute duty to consider oneself chosen. So when a minority are going to heaven, the odds are you're not going to heaven, but you must believe you're going to heaven, otherwise you lack faith in God. Otherwise you don't truly believe in God. And then therefore you'll be truly condemned by God. And to combat all doubts as temptations of the devil, since lack of self-confidence is the result of insufficient faith, hence of imperfect grace. To prove that God is perfect, to prove that God loves you, you must truly believe that you are chosen by God. If you doubt yourself, then you'll be condemned to hell. Then you become a servant of the devil. The exhortation of the apostle to make fast one's own call is here interpreted as a duty to attain serenity of one's own election and certification in the daily struggle of life. So you need to prove that you are one elect by focusing on this world. Focus your energies on conquering this world. On the other hand, in order to attain that subconfidence, intense worldly activity is recommended as the most suitable means. It and it alone disperses religious doubt and gives the certainty of grace. So this idea of you have anxiety, how do you deal with anxiety? Work, work, work, okay? OCD, obsessive compulsive behavior. What kind of work do you do? Make money, because the money is proof of God's grace. So he continues. There's worldly pros and asceticism. Ascendant just means like, you're actually not spending any money, okay? Not only are you compelled to make a lot of money, but you're also compelled not to spend any of it. Not to enjoy it, because that leads to corruption. that leads to decadence. Acted powerfully against the spontaneous enjoyment of possessions, it restricted consumption, especially of luxuries. So no one's spending any of this money. Where's this money going? It's going to the bank. And who's using this money in the bank? The government is. And what are they doing? They're using to fight wars. And that's how England, the Netherlands became empires because of access to all this surplus wealth that the process weren't spending. On the other hand, it had the psychological effect of freeing the acquisition of goods and inhibitions of traditionalist ethics. Okay, so the idea here is this. Before, if you're a wealthy, you're expected by everyone around you to support the community. Usually by organizing fees on religious festivals, okay? You work so hard to share your wealth. If you had too much money, It showed that you were against the community. Okay? It showed that you were selfish. But now, people believe that if you're wealthy, it means God favors you. The more wealthy you have, the more people respect you. Okay? It's gonna be inverse from the historical case. Historically, we believe that those who have too much money are evil. Now we believe that those who have too much money are inherently good. It's complete reverse. It broke the bonds and the impulse of acquisition in that it not only legalized it, but looked upon it as directly willed by God. So before it was embarrassing to have too much money, now it is prestigious to have too much money. The campaign against the temptations of the flesh and the dependence on external things was not a struggle against the rational acquisition, but against the irrational use of wealth. So what's evil is not to make a lot of money. What's evil is to use that money to enjoy yourself. Okay, so now he discusses the problems with this ideology, okay? The Puritan want to work in a calling. So the Puritan want to be close to God. We are forced to do so. We're not Puritans. Most of the world is not Puritans. We are stuck, we are imprisoned in their world. They create this world and we're stuck in it. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, okay, so the idea was, in the Catholic church, if you wanted to be an ascetic, if you wanted to deny the world, you went into a monastery. The Puritans made the entire world into a monastery, okay? And began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos, the modern economic order. It's talking about capitalism. So capitalism was created by the Puritans in order to rationalize the world. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production, which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition with irresistible force. So they create this system, which is industrial production. And this industrial production has made us all into slaves. And the soul of this industrial production system is capitalism, wealth for the sake of wealth. And there's no denying this system. You can never free yourself from the system. You're stuck inside the system. But not only that, but this entire industrial production, it has permeated into all aspects of life. It's permeated into the family. It's permeated into the school. Why do you have grates? Why do we have tests? Because of this industrial economy, right? Grades, tests are another form of money. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burned, okay? What he's saying here is that this system will keep on going until we destroy the planet, okay? Until we run out of resources, because that's what capitalism is. It's the expectation of the environment. In Baxter's view, the care for external good should only lie on the shoulders of the saint like a light cloak which can be thrown aside at any moment. So the idea of proselytism is, listen, external wealth, wealth is just a measure of your faith in God. That's how it's important. What's important is your faith, right? But the faith decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. Money was supposed to be a tool. Money was supposed to be a mechanism for us to connect with God. and now money, capitalism, industrial production, it's become our prison. There's no denying it. No one can now escape this, okay? Okay? Does it make sense to you? All right. So now he makes predictions. No one knows who will live in this cage in the future or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new profits will arise or there will be a great rebirth of ideas and ideals of neither mechanized petrification, embellished with a sort of convulsive self-importance. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I read this wrong, okay? Let me do this again. No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, whether at the end of this tremendous development, entirely new profits will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas. Okay, so what we're saying is this. As capitalism conquers more and more territory, as it becomes more embedded into everyday life, there will be a nostalgia for the Catholic Church and there may arise new prophets who will rebel against capitalism just like Martin Luther rebelled against the Catholic religion. And these new ideas will happen. They're called fascism and communism. So capitalism will give rise to the Nazis as well as the communists, the Bolsheviks. So this is the future. So he's making a prophecy. But if these things don't happen, then what will happen is this. Mechanized petrification embellished with a sort of convulsive self-importance. We believe today that we have achieved divinity. We've achieved heaven on earth. Capitalism is the greatest good. But if you think about it, our civilization has become a zombie civilization. It is about soul. It is about spirituality. It is about heart. It's all machine. It's all money. It's all obsession. Nothing else. So I'm sorry that this is not appearing properly. But that's what he's saying here. For of the last stage of this cultural development, it might well be truly said, specialist without spirit. We have scientists who lack purpose. They have no sense of divinity. They have no sense of mission. They're just doing technical work. Scientists who just do technical work. Sensualists about heart. This nonlidity imagines that it has achieved a level of civilization never before achieved. So that's what he's saying. He's saying like our civilization, it is a zombie civilization, it is in unlimited. It is nothing. It is nihilistic. But we believe this is perfection. And if you think about it, He's describing perfectly the world we live in today. It's perfect, okay? He wrote this in about 1900. He predicted this would happen, and he's right. We live in a zombie civilization. All right, okay. So this is George Simmel, who is a friend of Max Weber's. The contemporaries, the colleagues, the friends. And he's trying to explain where money comes from, okay? And as explained previously, money now has become a substitute for the idea of God. It's become reality itself. And why is that? Here explains it. The projection of mere relations into particular objects is one of the great accomplishments of the mind. So we're able to take an idea and transpose this idea onto a thing. We're able to take the idea of God and turn it into money. We can do that. And that's a great thing. When the mind is embodied in objects, These become a vehicle for the mind and doubt with a livelier and more comprehensive activity. When we do this, we turn God into money, our instead of reality becomes much more vibrant. We're able to understand reality much better. The ability to construct such symbolic objects attains its greatest triumph in money. Money becomes a placeholder for everything. For money, it represents peer interaction, it's peer's form. How do we know if we're working hard? How do we know if we are succeeding? How do we know if we have friends? Through money, okay? For capital accumulation. It makes comprehensible the most abstract concept. It is an individual thing whose essential significance is to reach beyond individualities. It's synthesizes everything, okay? Everyone agrees on money. Thus, money is the adequate expression of the relationship of man to the world, which can only be grasped in single and concrete instances. Yet only really can see when a singular becomes the embodiment of the living mental process which interweaves all singularities and in this fashion creates reality, okay? So, I'll be in the class, I talk about money, right? How money takes all different perspectives and converges into one thing, okay? And then it redesigns reality through this lens. That's what he's saying here, okay? The last person I want to talk about is Emile Durkheim. And he's a French sociologist, and his most famous book is called On Suicide. He's trying to discuss why is it that Protestants are much more likely to kill themselves than Catholics. Okay? And his answer is, it's because Protestants believe Protestants believe you have to struggle individually with faith, whereas Catholics don't believe that. Catholics believe that you just follow community rituals and you're good. So Protestants feel that they're alone and abandoned in this world, and that they must struggle out of this darkness. That leads to tremendous energy. It also leads sometimes to self-defeat. It leads to hopelessness and that's why they kill themselves. Okay, so let's not read this, but that's what he's saying, okay? Okay, but I want to read this. This is really important. He's talking about the fact that Protestants transfer this anxiety and accumulation of wealth, right? They're anxious about what God is. They're anxious when God loves them and they focus on the accumulation of wealth. Okay? And this is a problem because over-excited ambitions always exceeds the results that they achieve whether these may be because they have not been aware that they should not go any further. Okay, right? Let's just say that you wanna lose weight. Your obsession is to lose weight. It's possible that you may die in the process because you don't know how much weight you should lose. You don't know what the proper equilibrium is. You just want to lose as much weight as possible. That's a problem with accumulating money. You try to get more money to prove you're worth to God, but you can't stop. You don't know when to stop. OK? Consequently, nothing satisfies them, and all this agitation perpetually sustains itself by reaching any form of satiety. You cannot stop. You look at Jack Ma, the richest man in China at some point, right? He has all this money, $50 billion. What is he doing with it? Nothing. All he wants is to make more and more money. Why? Because only the acquisition of money brings him happiness. Nothing else does. It's a disease. Above all, as this race towards an unattainable goal can give no satisfaction, but the race itself, if that can be caused satisfaction, should anything chance to get in its way then one is left empty-handed. Okay? You're so focused on the opinion of wealth that if you lose this process, okay? If you stop this process, you will feel devoid of everything, okay? You could have $50 billion in a bank, but you drop out of this race. If you stop the accumulation of money, you will fall into anxiety and depression, right? Now, it so happens that at this time, The struggle becomes more violent and more painful, both because it is less regulated and because competition is fiercer. All right, so we're talking about capitalism. How, because it's all about the condition of wealth and the condition of wealth can only bring about more anxiety and more stress. It's bringing out all social bonds. Okay, it's bringing all traditional morality. It's bringing out all customs and norms. All classes are caught up in it because there's no longer any established classification. You're rich, you're poor, you're stuck in the system. No matter how rich you are, you're still playing this game. You can never escape it. So the effort is all the greater at the moment when it becomes more unproductive. How can the will to live not be weakened in these conditions? Okay, so, like, I know this is hard and I know what I'm saying is gonna be depressing, But what Max Weber is saying is, we live in a zombie civilization. Okay, that's what he's saying. What Emile Durkman is saying is that the civilization is on a path to suicide. It's on a path to self-destruction. There's no purpose in this civilization. It's all, we exist for the sake of accumulating nothing of value. And eventually, we'll just recognize this and we'll all have to die. Our civilization is on a path to suicide. And you know what? They're right, they're profits. Think about this. Never before in human history have we been as wealthy as technological progress, right? With the internet. As more connected, we can fly all around the world. You can go to the United States and study, and then come back and work, okay? You have more opportunities than ever before. But again, think about this, okay? Never before in human history have there been more depression, anxiety, more suicides, more feeling of disconnection. Okay? So think about this. Let's do a thought experiment. Let's just say that I have anxiety. And the way that I deal with this anxiety is I collect newspapers. Every day I'm out collecting newspapers. I fill this room with newspapers, and then I go next room and I fill up newspapers. Everyone would say that I am hoarding. The word is hoarding, and it is a disease. It's a disease. We all know it's a disease. If I were to go talk to a psychologist, he would say, I have a disease. I need to take some anxiety medication. I need to relax, go on vacation, whatever. But let's just say this. Let's just say I have anxiety. And all I want to do is make money. I make $1 million. I'm going to spend it. I put it in the bank, and I go make $2 million. And then I go make $3 million. And I'm not spending it, it's all in the bank, okay? How is that different from hoarding? How is that different from me collecting newspapers and just putting it in the house? It's not, there's no difference, right? But everyone would think I'm a great person. I am a good person because I'm working hard and I'm saving money, right? It's a contradiction in our society. It's a contradiction that exists because our society, our civilization is incapable of recognizing that we are a zombie civilization that is on the path to civilization or suicide. Okay, so this was depressing, but I feel as though we needed to discuss this. And again, this thing, ideas that we learned previously, we're combining it, and we are going to use these ideas to understand the future development. So any questions? Great. Yep. You're absolutely right. Okay. You're absolutely right. That that so in the Catholic religion suicide is the worst sin that you can commit. Okay. And in the Protestant religion, there are also mechanisms against suicide. But let's go back to the theory. The theory is double predestination. God has already decided who will be burned in hell and who will go to heaven and only a minority can go to heaven, right? And there's nothing you can do to change this. You understand? So if you follow the logic, you keep on suicide, you're doing God's will because you commit suicide because you don't believe in God or you don't have enough faith in God, which means that you're condemned anyway. So suicide, it's not a sin. It's a sign of weakness. Doesn't make sense. But also what's important for us to remember is that suicide, it's also a feeling of disconnection. It's a belief that no one cares if you die or not. No one supports you in your life and therefore you're better off dead. When you die, you're not actually impacting the community. And that's in Mount Durkens argument. You're always gonna have people kill themselves in all religions. You can't really stop that. But pros and cons are more likely to kill themselves because Prasim is a much more individualistic religion than Catholic. All right, does that make sense? Great, okay, next question. Okay, so these three are not philosophers, these three are sociologists. So they're social scientists. They're Max Weber, who is considered the founder of sociology, George Simmel, and Imel Dorke. These are the three major sociologists that really created modern social sciences. Okay, that's a great question. Okay. Okay, so these are social scientists and the thing about social scientists is they feel the responsibility is to diagnose problems. And once they diagnose problems, then it's up to us to figure out the solution. Okay, so let's figure out what What's their saying? So Weber is saying that this anxiety, which leads to capitalism, will ultimately lead to civilization on decline. That's his main argument. So again, he's not writing at the beginning of Protestantism, where Protestantism was a persecuted religion, And where it really gave hope to a lot of people. And it really empowered them to transform the lives. He's really talking about late processes when it's really comfortable world. And he's seeing a lot of issues. And so he's looking at this. He's looking at the anxiety which causes capitalism, which causes civilization decline. So he says there has to be a response. And there's going to be three possible responses. The first possible response is nothingness, okay? In which case, guess what? We've become a zombie society. A zombie society just means that we just go on day to day doing whatever, but we don't know why. We don't really care. We have no soul, we have no spirit, we have no energy, okay? That's what a zombie society is, and that's what he's afraid of. But it's also possible that there is a reaction, okay? Okay, which will lead to the return of the Catholic Church. Which was basically a theocracy. Does that make sense? That's the second possibility. And then another possibility is the idea of new profits. Or people who are trying to channel this discontent with capitalism in order to form new movements in the way that Martin Luther and John Coving did. Right? And in the 12th century, there were two major responses the problem capitalism. The first of course is called communism. The second is called fascism, okay, or the Nazis. All right, so the 20th century was really about defeating these two critics of capitalism, right? That's what the 20th century really was about. You first had World War II, which defeated Nazism, and then you have the Cold War, which defeated communism, all right? So So this is out. So right now, our two paths ahead of us is either a Islamic society or a return to our theocracy. And so if I'm a betting man, what a future looks like, I think it is most likely the world becomes a theocracy. And there are theocracy that exists today. So for example, let's look at North Korea. North Korea is a theocracy where people are not a lot to think for themselves. People must do what they're told, okay? And it's all very heavily ritualized society which worships the divinity of the supreme leader. We may hate this society, we may be disgusted by this society, but guess what, okay, this is really important. People in North Korea, even though they're poorer, even though they have less freedom, they are an average happier and more fulfilled more energetic than most societies. You compare North Korea with South Korea, okay? In South Korea, no one's having kids. That's a sign of complete hopelessness in their society. North Korea, they're having a lot of kids. That's the sort of faith in their society, okay? So that's what Max Weber is predicting. He's predicting these three possible paths. We tried, new profits path didn't work, okay? We don't want to become a zombie society. So the only path ahead of us is to become a theocracy. They are returned to the tyranny of the Catholic Church. But the tyranny gives us meaning, purpose, and spirituality, a connection with God that we are lacking into this society. But okay, let's just say, for the sake of argument, you know what, I like my individual freedom. I don't go to a theocracy where everyone's a slave. What can we do about this? Okay, so one issue that Max Weber doesn't really address, because he doesn't recognize the problem is, all these problems we're talking about is a problem of mass society, okay? When you have mass society, your options are much more limited. When you're a mass society, you need to feed millions and millions of people. You need to organize them. You need to give them something to do. Therefore, your political flexibility doesn't really exist. So in other words, thinking ahead, there are two solutions. Either you become a theocracy, or you figure out the problem of mass society. If society becomes, I mean, I'm sorry to say this, but if most people in the world died, then we would have more freedom in this world. But if we choose to continue the system, we have eight billion people struggling on this earth, and you're stuck with moving towards a theocracy. So that's what Max Weber is saying. He's basically giving us a prophecy about our future. Now, having said that, let's look at Durkheim. What's he saying? He's saying this. This is really important. It's a hard argument, but this is what he's saying. All right, what are you of suicide? Suicide is the result of disconnection. We do not think we are valuable in the world. We think that we are a loneless world. We don't want to be part of this world. We kill ourselves. It's a very simple idea, right? But then the question then is, why should disconnection? Because of anxiety, right? It's a belief that if I don't work hard, God will not favor me. Why is anxiety important? Because it leads to capitalism. So in other words, these four concepts are interconnected. This connection leads to suicide, but we have this connection because of anxiety. But anxiety is what feeds capitalism. If people weren't anxious, they wouldn't go out and work so hard to make money. They'd be like, you know what? I'm really happy making my $10 a day and stay at home eating noodles, because I don't care, right? Your society will collapse. Capitalism will collapse. So you understand. Capitalism creates suicide. That's why we have the highest suicide rate in the whole, in the entire human issue. More anxiety, more depression, more suicide, more unhappiness, more loneliness than ever before in human history. So you can't say capitalism is the issue, you work out the logic, capitalism is the issue. And that's why today in the United States and elsewhere in the world, they're talking about a return to a theocracy. Because the direct response to capitalism is a theocracy. Let us all obey the church and we're good. Now, women will have to stay at home and give birth to kids. Oh, and also, like if you're homosexual, we're gonna have to kill you. But that's the price we're going to have to pay. So it's a terrible world that we're going to. But what Durkheim is saying is, if we continue on the path of capitalism, people are going to choose the path of theocracy. Theocracy is almost a natural outcome of capitalism because of the problem of this connection. But are you going to be able to defeat capitalism ever? And the answer is no. We tried in the 20th century. It led to the death of tens of millions of people. Good luck trying to defeat capitalism. You can't do it. It can't be done. It's too powerful. Does that make sense? Any more questions? OK, great. So next Tuesday we do the tyrant revolution."}
{"video_id": "VanPH0GFTsA", "title": "Civilization #3:  The Religious Imagination", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VanPH0GFTsA", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 3412.487, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 6796, "text": "Okay, so I want to summarize and review what we have learned so far. So the main message is that for most of human history, we have been peaceful, egalitarian, and artistic. So about 200,000 years ago, our species, Homo sapiens, we were born in Africa. And then 50,000 years ago, because of climate change, we started to spread around the world, okay? And throughout most of our history, we have been hunter-gatherers. And we don't know that much about our history. We can only guess. But based on the available archaeological evidence, We were, for most of the time, peaceful, egalitarian, and artistic. Okay, so peaceful does not mean we were not violent. There's lots of evidence that there was in-group conflict. So for example, we discovered in burials people with skull fractures, okay? So there's been violence, But there's been no evidence of organized warfare. That comes much later, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is that we were egalitarian, meaning that there was no difference in status and power between men and women. Men and women were considered equal. There was no hierarchy, meaning that there were people who were considered more wealthy than other people. We know because we could not find any evidence of hierarchy, meaning larger houses, meaning groups of special privileges. Now, there are individuals who might have higher status and we know because they were buried more elaborately than other people. So for example, shamans, right? Shamans were their religious leaders And as such, they were courted higher status than everyone else. Okay? And the third thing is artistic. So as we know, they were engaged in cave paintings. They built monuments in order to celebrate and worship their religion. So for them, art really was about the expression and celebration of their religion. Okay? So for most of human history, We were peaceful, egalitarian and artistic. And we know that today we are not peaceful. We are not egalitarian. We are not that artistic. So what changed? Next week I'll explain to you what changed. Basically a new group of people called the Yamaya came into being and they had a different religion that celebrated warfare, patriarchy and wealth. and eventually spread around Europe and Asia and the conquered everyone, and they created a new history of humanity. That's next week, okay? So I want to explain the evidence for why we think most of human history, we were peaceful, egalitarian, and artistic. Okay, so something else that we discussed in class is we don't know what their religion was, but we suspect that it was animism and shamanism, okay? Remember that animism is the belief that we all come from the mother goddess, from one source of life, including trees, animals, and humans. So every living being has a soul, okay? And the other thing is that the soul is permanent. You can never kill it. The body and the soul are different. So it doesn't really matter if you die because your soul will go somewhere else and maybe come back. So death was not a big deal. And the third thing is that there's a spirit world or another world which is more real than our world. Our world is just a manifestation, a physical manifestation of the spirit world. But what matters is the spirit world. And the last thing is that there's an order to the universe. We have a part to play. So for example, we can kill animals to feed ourselves, but we must pay tribute to these animals before and after we kill them in order to maintain the harmony of the universe. Okay? So that's what we believe the religion of early humans were everywhere in the world, okay? Including in China, including in Europe. This is Copa Tepi and you can see that this is a teapillar and it's meant to represent a human And inside the tea pillar is an animal. So basically the tea pillar represents the manifestation of the animal spirit in us. And we believe that this is a religious festival that they would have before they went hunting. And the evidence for this is that at this site we found a lot of animal bones. Okay? So does that make sense guys? All right. So again this is all just review. This religion goes back a long time, okay? So this is 40,000 years ago. We found this small figurine, okay? It's a very small figurine in a cave in Germany. And this dates back to 40,000 years ago, okay? So remember, 50,000 years ago, we started to leave Africa and venture around, venture into Europe and around the world, okay? So this goes back to the beginning, the dawn of humanity. This is a flute that goes back to the same time. So at the beginning of humanity, we were religious, we celebrated our religion through music and through art and through shamanism. Does that make sense, guys? Yes? It's a figurine, it's a doll. So they believe that these dolls have religious qualities, right? Does that make sense? It's like paintings. Okay? So, remember, they also have these cave paintings where they're celebrating the mother god is and they're celebrating the fact that life is a circle. After you kill the animals, their soul goes back into the spirit world and then through proper, stupid and worship, you can bring them back into this world, okay? Okay, this is a shaman dressed as an animal. Okay? So now the question then is, okay, if we can not go back in time and observe the religion, how do we know what the religion is? And the answer is we have a field of study called anthropology, okay? Anthropology. Anthropology is a study of other cultures. And if our theory is right, then we should be able to find other cultures that are still alive today that practice this religion. And what we've discovered is that if you go to places in the jungle, in South America, and in Africa, in Australia, they do practice this religion. So understanding the religion gives us tremendous insight into the thinking and religion of early humans. And that's what we'll do today, okay? To truly understand what early humans thought and how they understood the world, okay? Does that make sense, guys? All right. So the first passage we're gonna look at is from a book called The Wayfinders by Wade Davis, This is a great book. If you guys ever have a chance, please read this book. It's extremely well written. Wade Davis, he's an anthropologist, Canadian, and this recently came out. So he spent a lot of time traveling around the world to explore and to understand indigenous peoples, people who are native to a land, and they've been there for a long, long time. So this is what he says about a tribe in the Amazon for us. In the beginning, before the creation of seasons, before the ancestral mother, Romi Kumu, woman Shaman, opened her womb before her blood and breast milk gave rise to rivers and her ribs to the mountain ridges of the world. There was only chaos in the universe. demons known as Heul prayed on their own kindred, bread without thought, committed incest without consequence devoured their own young. Roman Cumo responded by destroying the world with fire and floods. Then just as a mother turns over a warm slab of maniac bread on the griddle, she turned the inudated and charred world upside down, creating a flat and empty template from which life could emerge once again. As woman shaman, she then gave birth to a new world, land, water, forests, and animals. Okay? So this is what we call a creation myth. And every single civilization, every single people have a creation myth. So let me ask you this question okay why why do you need a creation myth what's this creation myth doing what does it explain okay how the world forms okay but this it doesn't mean much more important than that which is what to me who are we where we come from yes but there's something it yes it explains all that who we are where we come from okay that's what all creation myths do what else is this myth doing which is very important for us. To me? Okay, so it's telling us how the universe was formed, okay? What is in here that's very important and which is important for society to function well? Okay, so the woman shaman is the mother god is, but what's in this paragraph that's very important in order for society to function? What do you need for society to function? You need rules and laws, right? So what this creation myth is doing, what all Christian myths is doing is explaining to you the legal structure of your society. Why you can't do certain things, okay? So for example, you can't commit incest, okay? You can't eat your young people, you can't kill the young people, okay? Why? Because that's what evil people do. You understand? So what this Christian myth is doing is it's basically explaining the legal system, the rules, and why we have them. We have these rules because they're evil. They represent the evil spirit. Okay, does that make sense, guys? Okay, the other thing that you will notice about this creation myth is that it's very sophisticated and very elaborate. Okay, so this is a visualization of their understanding of creation. And as you can understand, it's very complicated, okay? Does that make sense? Why is it complicated? Why is it complicated? Why is this so complicated? There are reasons for it, why? Okay, so one thing that you will learn in this class is that what's really important is for you to believe that your religion is correct, okay? It is just correct as science. And what makes people believe your religion is correct, you have to accomplish three things. The first is grandness, meaning that is huge, vast. And as you can see, this is a vast religion, a vast cosmology of how things started. So grandness is very important. Then you have, then you need completeness. And the idea of completeness is that everything that you see in the world must be explained in this cosmology. Okay? So what this is doing is explain to you how everything started, okay? Where everything comes from. So completeness is important. Last thing is unity. Meaning that there's a beginning and there's an end. Okay? As you can see, there's a beginning and then there's an end. Okay? So this is something that we will learn in this class as we explore other religions, including Judaism and Christianity, where for a religion to be powerful, for it to be authoritative, you need these three ideas, greatness, completeness, and unity. Does that make sense? All right, let's keep on going. All right, so thus, for the people living today in the forests of the Paraparana, Okay, this is the Amazon forest. The entire natural world is saturated with meaning and cosmological significance, okay? They feel that everything around them has life, and it's all connected, it's one unified whole, okay? Every rock and waterfall embodies a story. Plants and animals are but distinct physical manifestations of the same essential spiritual essence. We all come from the woman's Charmaine, we all come from the mother goddess, therefore we all have the spark of life in us. And therefore we must be respected, okay? The plants and the animals almost be respected as much as we are respected. At the same time, everything is more than it appears. For the visible world is only one level of perception. Behind every tangible form, tangible means concrete, physical, okay? Every plant and animal is a shadow dimension, a place invisible to ordinary people, but visible to the shaman. So in other words, our world is a world we can see. But there are other worlds, the shadow dimension, which is more real, which captures our essence, where the soul resides, okay? That's more real. And it's a job of the shaman to see and communicate with this world. This is the realm of the whole spirit, a world of deified ancestors where rocks and rivers are alive. Plants and animals are human beings, sap and blood, the bodily fluids of the primary river of the Anacana. Hidden in cataracts behind the physical veil of waterfalls in the very center of stones are the great malacas of the whole spirit where everything is beautiful. the shining feathers, the coca, the cowabash of tobacco powder, which is in itself the skull and brain of the sun. Okay? Now, reading this, what can we say about their religion? What can we say about their religion? That would be surprising to you. Okay, first of all, it's very imaginative, right? It's very imaginative. They have a vivid imagination, okay? The other thing is that it's extremely sophisticated and complex. So one major prejudice that we might have, all these people is, well, they don't drive cars, they don't have cell phones, therefore they must be stupid. But clearly from our understanding of their religious beliefs, they're actually extremely imaginative and extremely sophisticated. Okay, does that make sense guys? All right. So this is their shamans in religious practice. Okay? What can we say about this picture? What stands out about this picture? What surprises you or what catches your eye about them? What can we say about their beliefs based on this picture? Okay, yeah. So there's a lot of, There's a lot of thought put into what they wear, right? Okay, so again, sophistication. Their clothing, the way they dress, suggests that this is a very sophisticated religion, okay? It's not like they just put on anything. It seems they put a lot of care and thought into what they wear, okay? That's the first thing. What's the other thing? What's the other thing? other thing. There are not that many of them, there's three of them. But what do you notice about the way they look in their bodies and the way they stand in relation to each other? What do you notice? Yeah? Okay, yeah, I mean he probably has a higher status, okay, and he stands in the middle, okay? What else? What else? Okay, so you're right in like, Like, okay, if this is a tribe and all they're trying to do is hunt and eat food, none of this makes any sense, right? But the main argument that I've been trying to tell you is, like, no, their first priority is their religion. Okay? So everything they do has a religious significance to it. We don't know what it is. They don't really speak our language. But for them, everything that they do must have a religious meaning. Okay? So it's a religion that centers their life. So the other thing I would say is, you can see there's some organization in order to it, right? So as you say, the person, the elder, stands in the middle, okay? And these two, can you see the symmetry? Okay, it's clear that they are doing a religious ceremony. And because of this religious ceremony, requires their bodies to be a certain way in relation to each other. It requires them to dress a certain way. It requires them to say certain things, okay? Clearly, they are in prayer of some sort. We call this the idea of ritual. Ritual is just the expression of religion in everyday practice. In other words, their lives are extremely ritualized. Meaning, what they do every second has a religious meaning and a religious significance. Does that make sense to you guys? So for example, you come to school and you think your life is very ordered, because maybe at eight o'clock you start class. And then when class starts, the teacher takes attendance. That's all ritual. And then at 8.45, the bell rings, and then you go off and get some water or something. If you want to go to the restroom, you have to raise your hand. This is all what we call ritual. So your lives are extremely ritualized. The thing about ritual is behind the ritual, there has to be a belief system. So for us, the school, we believe the system is set up so that you learn how to do well in life. You learn how to be on time. You learn how to respect authority. learn how to read books. So this society is in exactly the same way where every minute of their lives there's order and structure to what they do that has meaning and purpose. Does that make sense guys? Okay so let's talk about their ritual. It's to the realm of the whole spirit that the Shaman goes in ritual. So the shaman is responsible for entering the world of the demons and negotiating and communicating with them. That's his role. That's why he has his power and authority. Contrary to popular lore in the West, the shaman of the Barra Asana never uses or manipulates medicinal plants. His duty and sacred it, paths is to move in the timeless realm of the whole, embrace the primordial powers and harness and restore the energy of all creation. He is like a modern engineer who enters the depths of a nuclear reactor to renew the entire cosmic order. So if, for example, plants are dying outside, what does this mean? if plants are dying outside, what does this mean? If animals and plants are dying, how can we fix the problem? Why are bad things happening? Bad things are happening because the spirits are unhappy. Right, does that make sense? So therefore, you must go into the spirit world and understand why the spirits aren't unhappy and fix it, okay? And that's the role of the shaman. And what this is saying is this. What this is saying is that our world doesn't matter guys. Our world is insignificant. What matters is the spirit world. Because the spirit world is what controls everything. Does that make sense guys? Okay. Among the Bara Sanna such renewal is a fundamental obligation of the living. In practice this implies that the Bara Sanna see the earth as potent, the force as being alive with spiritual beings and ancestral powers. To live off the land is to embrace both its creative and destructive potential. Human beings, plants and animals share the same cosmic origin and a profound sense are seen as essentially identical, responsive to the same principles, obligated by the same duties, responsible for the collective well-being of creation. There is no separation between nature and culture. Without the forest and the rivers, humans would perish. Without people, the natural world would have no order or meaning. All would be chaos. Dozen norms that drive social behavior would have no order or meaning. Sorry, would also define the manner in which human beings interact with the wild, the plants and animals, the multiple phenomenon of the natural world, lightning and thunder, the sun and the moon, the scent of a blossom, the sound order of death. So everything is connected with each other. We're all equals. Does that make sense, guys? This is what we call animism. All right, so let's talk about hunting. There's something that we talked about last class. If we are the same as animals and plants, what allows us, what gives us permission to kill other animals? And this passage explains it. When men go to the forest to hunt or fish, it is never a trivial passage. You cannot just go and hunt, okay? You need permission. First, the shaman must travel in trance to negotiate with the masters of the animals, forging a mystical contract with the spirit, guardian, and exchange based always on reciprocity. Reciprocity means give and take. If I give you a present, you must give me a present. The Brasarana compared to marriage for hunting, two is a form of courtship in which one seeks the blessings of a greater authority for the honor of taking into one's family a precious being. Meat is not the right of a hunter, but a gift from the spirit world. To kill a permission is to risk death by a spirit guardian, be it in the form of a jaguar, Anaconda, Tapur, or Harpy Eagle. There's something that we discussed in the cave paintings. Why did they spend so much time painting these animals? We said it's because they're trying to pay tribute to the animals. If I kill you, I must thank you for taking your meat to replenish myself, but I also must ask for your forgiveness. Otherwise, the animal soul may seek vengeance. Does that make sense? So this is the essence of the religion. If we hunt, we must first pay tribute, okay? And that's what explains kind of Hoyek, right? Okay, the bull and the people, before they go hunting, they must pay tribute to all the animals, okay? This is true. And you also look at the cave paintings, right? They have all these cave paintings. And what they celebrate is not themselves. What they celebrate are the animals, because it's the animals that give them life, that give them nourishment and meat, okay? Does that make sense? So, and you can see this in case all around Europe and around the world, okay? As the ritual begins, time collapses. There are two series of dances, separated by the liminal moments of the day, dawn, dusk, and midnight. So the shaman, during the ritual, is what needs to communicate with the animals in the spirit world. To do that, he changes from fish to animal to human being and back again, transcending every form, becoming pure energy flowing among every dimension of reality, past and present here and there, mythic and mundane. His chance we call by name every point of geography met on the ancestral journey of the Anacana. So as you can see before the hunt, the ritual is extremely elaborate, sophisticated, and complex. And its main purpose is to celebrate the unity of life and to ask permission and to ask for forgiveness as the hunters go kill the animals. Okay, does that make sense guys? And again, this explains, okay, so the shamans will change into animals, okay, in order to better communicate with the animals. And this explains all the cave paintings and how 40,000 years ago, they were creating dolls of shamans dressed as animals, okay? because for them, this is what is true. Okay, doesn't make sense guys. All right, so any questions so far before I move on? Are you guys clear about what's going on? Okay, all right. Now let's move to Africa, okay? We were in South America and they're still there today. If you wanna go visit that tribe, you can do so. Okay, now let's go to Africa. And in Africa, there's a group of people called the pygmies, okay? the pygmies. And there's a very famous book by a British anthropologist by the name of Colin Chernbowl, okay? And he discusses how the pygmies practice the religious beliefs. At the very center of the religion is something called the molymo, okay? Which is a trumpet-like instrument. And the Malimo allows them to communicate with the forest. It allows them to communicate with the spirit world. And that's how they resolve every issue, okay? And the Malimo also captures the sound and spirit of the forest, okay? All right, so even though we are in a different part of the world, we're in Africa, and even though the pygmies have different religious beliefs than the people of the Amazon, what you will discover, what you will notice is that essentially the same religion, okay? The same idea that we are part of nature and that our job is to help nature maintain balance and harmony, okay? Okay, so what I want you to know, okay, is compare contrasts the way we think today and how they thought before, okay? So let's read. I had no idea of how far we had come or in what direction. So he's following the group of pygmies around as they hunt. But I knew we had left the camp far behind. It was the first time I had known a group of pygmies to be so silent. Normally, unless hunting, they are deliberately noisy, but now just at the time that leopards would be prowling about in search of food, they seemed unwilling to disturb the forest or the animals it concealed. Just the opposite, in fact, it was as if they were a part of the silence and the darkness of the forest itself and were only fearful, lest any sound might betray their presence to some person or think not of the forest. They stood there quiet and still and it struck me with a sudden shock that not one of them carried a spear or bow and arrow. As they peered into the dust and cocked their heads first on their side, then on that satisfying themselves that we were really alone, it seemed that they felt themselves so much apart of the forest, and of all the living things in it, they had no need to fear anything, except that which was not off the forest. One of them said to me later, when we are the children of the forest, what need have we to be afraid of it? We are only afraid of that which is outside the forest. OK, so what I want to do now is through by analyzing this passage, passage, explore how our minds are different from their minds. OK, so our mind is what we can sort of modern. And their mind is what we consider pre-modern. What's the first major difference between I, the British anthropologists, and how we think, and how they think? What's the first difference you notice from this passage? First of all, what is the word that tells us that he doesn't really understand how these people think and behave? What's the word that tells us he doesn't really understand these people? This is actually a great SAT question. if you guys plan on taking the SAT, okay? There's a word in this passage that tells us he is actually, he is actually, he doesn't really understand how these people think and feel. What's the word? Shock, right? Shock, okay? So he's surprised by their behavior. Why is he surprised? What confuses him? Anyone? Why, what, yes, exactly, okay? Why does that surprise him? Exactly, okay? So here's the first big difference. Why do we think that nature is dangerous? Why do they not think nature is dangerous? Why? Why, guys? That's exactly right, okay? He thinks nature is dangerous because they're leopards. They're predators, okay? They don't think nature is dangerous. What's the difference? What's the difference? Okay, the first major difference is this. Our minds think that we are separate from nature, okay? Man versus nature. man versus nature. But they think they are part of nature, okay? So let me ask you this question. Why do we fear nature? What makes us fear nature? If I put you in a force, you're afraid. Why? Yes, okay? Why are you afraid of the unknown? Okay, you don't know what you encounter, but why does that make you afraid? Why? Why would the unknown make you afraid? What is that we are obsessed with? See me? We're obsessed with control, right? We have to control everything. We want to know something because we want to control it. We like animals in the zoo. We do not like animals in the forest. We can control animals in the zoo. We cannot control animals in the forest. So we're obsessed with control. Why aren't they afraid of nature? What's their attitude? What are the Pygmies' attitudes? We want to control nature, but they want. Therefore they, okay, the word is trust, right? Trust. They don't have to control nature because they trust nature. They believe the leopards know them and they know the leopards, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, so that's the first major difference between our world and their world. And we've been taught that nature is our enemy, our nature is outside us. Whereas they believe that they are part of nature. Okay? Does it make sense, guys? All right, let's move on. All right. So this is about their religious practice, okay? So they have a meal together and then they sing or they use the Maloma O to make noises and they sing and dance, okay? Everyone ate his fill as and when he pleased, a couple of the older men saying they would wait until the youngsters had finished before they ate. But they did not wait for long. I was told, however, that everyone had to eat just as no adult male was allowed to sleep but to sing while Malomo was singing was in progress. Apparently, one of the greatest crimes that a pygmy can commit, if not the greatest, is to be found asleep when Malomo is singing. When the man stood up and miming, as all pigments love to do, he showed how they used to search for sleeping man, they spear under each arm and how if they found one, they would spear him in the stomach and kill him completely and forever. I was told that then his body would be buried under the Komalumolamo. The Komalumolamo is a great fire in which they practice their religion. nobody would be allowed to mention his death even to remark on his absence. The woman would be told that the mollomo itself, the great animal of the forest, had carried off one of their number. But like the men, they would ask no questions and would never again mention the missing men. Okay, so in this world, the greatest crime you can commit is not to kill someone but to sleep during the religion. Can someone explain why that's the case? In this world, okay, the pygmy world, the worst you can do is sleep. Why is that the case? Okay, let's just say that we're having a class and one of you is sleeping, okay? And I get so angry that I want to kill that person. Why would I I don't wanna do that. What's my logic? It's disrespectful of what? Okay, it's disrespectful of my authority that is true, but then I just ask a person to leave my class, right? Or I shut up at that person, but I wanna kill that person, why? What's happened? Okay, what is a classroom? What is a classroom? Okay, a place to study, what else? What are we doing now? Yeah, but what is class? What is classroom? What allows a classroom to exist? What is the ritual we're practicing? Okay, so a classroom you can understand as the collective experience, okay? A classroom happens when everyone is participating in it. Does that make sense? That's what makes a classroom alive. So why would be angry if one of you is sleeping? But why does that matter? If you're sleeping, what are you telling me? Yeah, is that a classroom? Is that real? This discussion is not real. It's pointless. You understand? So that's what's happening here. They're malemo singing the ritual. It's meant for everyone to recognize that the religion is real. It's more real than the reality. Okay, but if you're sleeping, you're saying, no guys, this doesn't matter. What we're doing does not matter. And therefore, what you're doing is, you're not committing violence on one person. You're committing violence on the community. You're committing violence on the religion. You're insulting the forest. You're insulting the God. Does that make sense? And that's the worst crime because reality happens. This religion is only possible if everyone believes that it is true. If you're sleeping, it means you don't think it's true. And therefore you are, first of all, rejecting the community. You're telling everyone, you're all idiots. Okay? Second thing is that you might endanger the community because you're insulting the forest. Does that make sense, guys? Okay, so for most of human history, people take their religion extremely seriously. So seriously that they think it's more real than reality. As long as everyone believes in it, it's true. But if someone doesn't believe in it, then we have to kill that person because if he doesn't believe in it, then it might cause our religion to die. Does that make sense? Any questions so far? Any questions? We're all clear, right? And what I'm trying to show you is the power of religion. How once we have the religious imagination, we can create things that are actually, for us, more real than reality. So that's the second thing that's different about us, from other human beings. For most of human history, we were spiritual, okay? We're spiritual meaning like we believe like the world of spirits or soul, it exists, okay? Today the word we use is materialistic, materialistic. And the idea of materialistic is this, if we cannot see it, okay? It's not real, okay? God can't be real because we can't find it. The soul can't be real because we can't measure it. Imagination can't be real because we don't know where it comes from. It doesn't make sense? And obviously, okay? Obviously, this idea of materialism is wrong. How can you say the imagination doesn't exist? But unfortunately, we have structured our society around this idea. All science, when you go to science class, they teach you this. If it's real, you can measure it. You can see it. You can feel it. But for most of human history, we didn't believe that. We thought, OK, there is a spiritual world, and that matters just as much as reality. In fact, it probably matters more than reality. So this is making sense, right, guys? OK. Okay. For a month, I sat every evening at the Kamal Molo listening, watching, okay? If I still had little idea of what was going on, at least I felt that ear of importance and expectancy. Every evening when the woman shut themselves up, pretending that they were afraid to see the animal in the forest. Every evening, when the man gathered around the fire pretending they thought that the woman thought that the drink pipes were animals every evening on the trumpet drum drain pipes, imitated leopards and elephants and buffaloes. Every evening when all this make believe was going on, I felt that something very real and very great was going on beneath it. Something that everyone else took for granted and I thought which only I was ignorant. Okay, clearly he does not understand these people. What word tells us he doesn't understand these people? He doesn't know what's going on, why? What word tells us this? To me? Why is he ignorant? There's a word in here that tells us he doesn't understand these people at all. This word shows that there's a chasm, okay? A huge difference between the Pygmies and us. What is this word? What word were the Pygmies not used here? They've been insulted by this word. What's the word? You use it over and over again, right? There's a word here that's insulting. No, what word here in this passage would the Pimmy's find insulting? So if another teacher comes in to my class and he says, wow, your class is a lot of fun. I'd be insulted, why? I'd be insulted, why? No. Well, you guys have so much fun in this class. You play a lot. I've been insulted, why? To me? You're only, yeah, this is not studying, okay? This is not serious academic work. This is playing. It has no significance, no meaning, right? So what word implies that here? It repeats itself over and over. Pretending, right? Pretending. We think they're playing. What do they think? We think they're pretending. We think they're playing. What do they think? They think it's all true, do you understand? For them, their religion is more true than this world. That's the power of the human imagination. You can imagine a world, and this world, as long as many of you are imagining it together, it's more true, more powerful, more real than this world. That's the power of religion, okay? What we call the religious imagination. And we'll see this over and over again in human history, okay? Does that make sense, guys? Okay, so we've been taught that, oh, you can't see it, it must be pretending. It must be make-believe. But for most of human history, for most people, this is not playing, this is not pretending. It's true, it's real. It's what allows us to be close to God. Okay, God is real. This world we live in, it's not real. Okay? Does that make sense, guys? All right. Okay, so let's look at the last paragraph and then we'll finish for the day. He went on to tell the Pygmies, call them Malomo whenever things seem to be going wrong. It may be that the hunting is bad, he said, or that someone is ill or as now that someone has died. These are not good things and we like things to be good. So we call out the Malimo and it makes them good as they should be. So this is very similar to the shaman going into the spirit world when things are bad. Things are bad because the spirits aren't happy. Normally effing goes well in our world, in our forest, but at night when we are sleeping Sometimes things go wrong because we are not awake to stop them from going wrong. Army and invader camp, leopards may come in and steal a hunting dog or even a child. If we were awake, these things would not happen. So when something big goes wrong, like illness or bad hunting or death, it must be because the force is sleeping and not looking after its children. So what do we do? We wake it up. We wake it up by singing to it, and we do this because we want it to awaken happy. Then effing will be well and good again. So when our world is going well, then also we sing to the forest because we want it to share our happiness. You understand? So this is like them going to the spirit world and communicating with the spirits. So it's almost the same religion. Maybe the details are different, but the idea is the same. The idea is that we're all interconnected, animals, plants, humans, all the same. This is not the real world. The spirit world, the forest, they're the real world. And for us to maintain our health and our happiness and our safety, we must always communicate with this other world and make sure they're happy. Does it make sense? And because of this belief, it means we shouldn't go to war with other people, okay? Because then that causes mayhem and chaos in the spirit world. Our job is to maintain harmony and balance in this world. We're caretakers, okay? It means we should not be in conflict with each other. We should be egalitarian. We should be equal because we're all from the same mother goddess. We're all from the same forest. We're all from the same woman shaman. It means we have to be artistic because we have to celebrate and worship the spirit world. Does that make sense? So again, for most of human history, we were like this. And even today, in a lot of cultures around the world, they're still like this. So another question is, what changed? Why do we have war? Why do we have hierarchy? Why do we have patriarchy? Why are men superior to women? Why do some rich people have all the power? This clearly goes against this religion. And what I will show you starting next class is the beginning of a new religion and how this new religion that worships wealth, power and war conquered everyone. Does that make sense? Any questions before we break anything you're unclear about? OK. OK."}

That's what the Romans believe. We actually don't know okay So around this time, Rome, it's just like a small, insignificant kingdom in the middle of Italy. Okay? It was on a tiber. This is Rome. And it's part of Italy called a Latin area. Okay? So these people are known as the Latins. Now at this time, and over the next centuries, Rome would be a small, poor kingdom, always at war with its neighbors. Primarily the sadbins over here, and then you have other tribes as well. At this time, the dominant civilization is what we call the Etruscans. And the Etruscans are the most advanced civilization in Italy during this time. And it is very similar to Greece, in that there are different city-states and they trade with each other. And because they are by the sea, they are able to access cultures and ideas and goods from all around the world. Then across the Mediterranean, you have a place called Carthage. Here is Sicily. And I don't call Sicily. Sicily is important because it's basically the main island of the Mediterranean. So you want to control the Mediterranean sea and the trade, you have to control Sicily. So across the sea is Carthage. And Carthage is a colony of Phoenicia, which is in the Levant. And over the next few hundred years, Carthage would become the dominant economic power of the Mediterranean. because they're very good at trade and they're very good at sailing. Okay, so they'll travel and sell all around the world and found new colonies and slowly they'll build up their own little empire across the Mediterranean. And they are for the longest time the wealthy city in Europe basically. Okay? And of course, over here are the Greeks, right? And we spent a lot of time discussing the Greeks. So around this time, about 500 BCE, if you look at these three major civilizations, right? Or sorry, there's actually four. The Trishkins, the Greeks, the Cossiginians, and then you have these Romans. No one could expect or predict that the Romans would become the great empire that it did become, right? So what we will look at the first class is, how did Rome become so powerful? And the easy answer is, it's good at war. It's really good at war. And then the question then is, well, why is it good at war? Why is it better than the Greeks or the Carthaginians? And the answer is, because the Romans are not for it to die, and because the Romans have a different conception of citizenship than the Greeks. OK, remember the Greeks were extremely jealous of citizenship. It was very hard to become an Athenian. It was very hard to become a Spartan. You basically have to be born into the Polis. Same thing with the Carthaginians. They were not as strict as the Greeks. They were pretty inflexible as well. proud of being a citizen. Rome, because it was the poorest and smallest, it had no choice. If you wanted to immigrate to Rome, they would welcome you as a citizen. And as such, they could throughout its history draw on the vast manpower pool in the surrounding areas. And as such, with their almost unlimited manpower resources, they could eventually overwhelm the Greeks and the Carpathians and become the dominant power in the Mediterranean. Why about 200 BC? That's the easy answer, and that's what most historians and most scholars believe. But I wanna be more precise, okay? I want to show you that ultimately, It's the value system or what is known as the character of these different civilizations that ultimately determine their fate and future. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so about 500 BCE, Rome becomes a republic. And at this time, the Etruscan culture is dominating Rome. In fact, three out of Rome's seven kings previously were Etruscans. So culturally and traditionally speaking, the Etruscans have this huge impact on Rome. But because Rome is very good at war, it's slowly able to expand and conquer the Etruscans and basically control all of Italy. Okay, and because the Romans are expansionists by nature. They are a war-like people. They are basically a war machine They all they now want to control Sicily and The coast okay, and this brings them into conflict with the Greeks Because remember the Greeks when they build colonies they build it either on islands or near the coast because that's what allows them to trade and also connect with the Greek diaspora around the Mediterranean and the Aegean. And in about 280, the Greeks in southern Italy, they call for help. And remember at this time the Greek world is dominant throughout the world. So Alexander conquered most of the world and his generals now control most of the territory. And one of the successors, Alexander, his name is Pyrus, okay, he decides this is an opportunity for him to build his own empire. So he responds to the Greeks who call for help against Rome, okay, so Rome is threatening the Greeks in southern Italy, the Greeks are asking for help from the compatriots. And so, Pyros comes with an army to help his compatriots. And remember, at this time, the Greeks have the best military in the world because of the hoplite phallics. And Pyros is destroying the Romans. Battle after battle, Pyros is destroying and decimating the Romans. Eventually, Pyros says this, Wow, I'm winning so many wars, I'm winning so many battles. And if I continue to win battles, I will be completely out of med. I will have no more soldiers left. Okay, and this is what the phrase, this is where the phrase, Pyrrhic victory comes from, right? You can win, but the costs of victory are so high, you might as well have lost, all right? And so what this means is, Even though the Romans were militarily inferior to the Greeks, the Romans weren't afraid to die, and they inflicted so many casualties on the Greeks that the Greeks eventually had to withdraw. And this will start many centuries of war between the Romans and the Greeks. Remember, at this time in the beginning, the Greeks are wealthier, more numerous, and more military dominant than the Romans. But eventually, because of the Roman way of war, Rome will eventually conquer the Greeks. So that's the Greeks. Eventually, the Romans went to Sicily. And this brings them into direct conflict with Carthage. And this starts what is called the First Punic War. Now, there's a problem. Carthage is a naval power. Rome is a land power. Rome has no navy. So what Rome does is slowly over time it builds its own navy and at first it sucks. They lose a lot of ships and so the Romans build more ships and they get slaughtered by the Carthaginians at sea. So they build more ships and more ships and more ships and eventually they overwhelm the Carthaginians. And so after 20 years of war in what is called the First Punic War, Rome becomes a dominant naval power in the Mediterranean. Carthage becomes second. That's something strange happens, okay? Carthage, it is a trading power, is a maritime power, but, and while it's able to dominate its neighbors, okay, it establishes an empire in Northern Africa and in Spain, it loses a lot of wars against the Greeks and the Romans were just better warriors. But then the Carthaginians produced a man named Hannibal Carba, Hannibal Barca. And Hannibal Barca is considered by many military historians to be the greatest general who ever lived. As a military strategist, Hannibal had no competitor. And Hannibal Barca, he hates Rome over passion. He understands this. He understands that Rome is fundamentally an expansionist military power. Rome will not stop until it has conquered the world. So even though technically Carthage and Rome are at peace, eventually Rome will come for Carthage. So it is better to take a fight to Rome first than to wait for Rome to come to you. Now, Carthage at this time, it is basically a republic like Rome. And it's run by people called, by something called council elders. And these are the wealthiest citizens in Carthage. And there's elements of democracy and all of us as well. But it's primarily republic, okay? It's run by these people. And these are merchants. These are wealthy people. War is bad for business. So they were not supportive of Hannibal in his desire for war against Rome. So Hannibal did two things. The first thing is he was in charge of civil mines in Spain. And what he did was he conquered a lot of Spanish territory for Carthage. And so he was able to mask more wealth. He took this wealth and he used it to basically bribe the counts of elders, to leave them alone and to support his military adventures in Spain. And again, these are business people. If it's profitable, they will support you. And then what Hannibal did was he did something that was unimaginable before. He took his army and he crossed the Alps. He crossed the Alps, sorry the Alps are here, into Italy. He is now at Rome's doorstep. And again, before Hanwell did this, it was found impossible to cross the Alps, especially in winter with an army, okay? But Hanwell did that. He lost a lot of men and elephants, wild elephants in his crossing, but he was able to cross. And when he crossed, he was able to summon a lot of allies to his side, okay? Because Rome was at war with everyone in Italy and with the Gauls to the north of Italy in France, okay? So Rome had a lot of enemies. And so Hannibal was able to replenish his forces once he landed in Italy. He was also a very charismatic speaker, a great general, okay? Rome heard about this, And at first Romans were shocked, but they weren't scared. Romans are war machine. So they decided to send an army against Hannibal. And army after army fell against Hannibal. Hannibal was able to defeat Roman soldiers and armies using superior military tactics and strategies. Then the Romans decide, you know what? Here's what we're going to do. We'll take two years off, and we're going to build the world's largest army, okay, 80,000 men. And at this time, Hannibal had about 40,000 men. And then we'll take these 80,000 soldiers and those soldiers throw at Hannibal and crush Hannibal and the war will be over, okay? And that's the strategy. That's the Roman way. The Romans are not creative. They are just brutal, bold, and direct, That's just their way of war. And so Hannibal meets his 80,000 soldier army at a place called Canine. And they fight something called the Battle of Canine in 216 B.C. And this is the most famous battle in human history. Okay? Remember, the Romans outnumber Hannibal two to one. And what Hannibal does is he decides on a place to face the Romans. And in this place, it's a small valley. And so even though the Romans are numerically superior because the valley is small, they're forced to march in a straight line as opposed to in a wide line. If you have more numbers, you want to march in a wide line. but because of the geography they're forced to march in a straight long line, okay? So they're marching this way. Hannibal is uphill with his army, and he does something strange. He organizes his army not in a straight line, but in a concave line, okay, like this, concave. And the Romans look at this and they laugh because they've never seen anything like this before. And they think it's a sign of weakness. It means the military under Hannibal, it's undisciplined. They're just amateurs. This will be over in an hour, okay? So the Romans are marching confidently against Hannibal. They're attacking. On the wings of both armies are the horsemen, the cavalry. Okay? So what happens as the Romans march against Hannibal is Hannibal sends his cavalry against the Roman cavalry. and they overwhelm the Roman cavalry. And now they're turning back in to attack the flank or the back. Meanwhile, the Roman attack is so powerful, the surge is so strong that the concave of Handel's army turns upside down. It turns upside down. When it does so, it traps the Roman army in a circle. Okay? Do you see this? Okay? Now they are inside a circle and the army is coming around and attacking from the back. Militarily, we call this the double-envelopment strategy. Double-envelopment strategy. And so the Romans are circled completely. And what follows is the greatest massacre in history, militarily, until World War I. The army of 80,000 that the Romans sent lost almost 70,000 men. 70,000 men died that day. And again, no military will lose so much men until World War I when they had much larger armies like millions of people, and when they had machine guns, all right? So this is like the greatest military disaster in human history up to this point. The disaster is so great that right now, Rome has lost 20%, okay? 20% of its adult male population. To put that in context, in World War I, The Germans lost anywhere between 10% to 15% of their adult male population before they were forced to surrender to the Allies. Okay? So Rome has lost 20%. It's lost a third of the Senate. The Senate is the highest governing body of Rome. So a third of their leadership is dead. At the same time, Hannibal is able to convince the Greeks to start a second front against the Romans. Okay. So at this point, the war is basically over and Hannibal sends envoys to Rome and says, listen, um, the war is over. I'm willing to negotiate a peace settlement. I am willing to negotiate peace terms. And there's something strange happens. And this is unique in human history. Okay. The woman Senate, they come together and they discuss a situation. It's bleak. It's hopeless. But they're Romans. Romans do not surrender. So the Senate told Hannibal, we will continue the war. We will raise another army. If you want to come attack us, come. We will be ready for you. And this is completely unexpected, okay? Hannibal does not know what to do. And this war continues, and this again is 216. This was continued for another 15 years, and then 15 years later, the Romans have won. They destroyed the Carthaginian presence in Spain, and they conquered, and they landed in Africa and forced Carthaginians to surrender. Okay, so this is a mystery. Why did the Romans not surrender? And how were the Romans able to defeat, not just the Carthaginians, but also the Greeks. And also like everyone else, okay? Because at that time, Hannibal basically united the entire world against Rome, against Rome and Rome, in the end, even though it was very costly, right? They did win. So that's a mystery, okay? So, first thing we need to understand is traditional military doctrine about who wins wars. It's basically wrong. Traditionally, we understand the military about three things. Manpower. How many soldiers do you have? Technology. How good are your weapons? And resources. How wealthy are you? Traditionally, we've understood war making. If you're good at war, you will have these three things. Lots of soldiers, lots of technology, and lots of money. And if you analyze it this way, then Rome should be no match against Carthage. Carthage is a lot wealthier. It has more technology. It has the greatest general in Hannibal. But at the same time, the Athenians should not have been able to defeat the Persians. At the same time, Alexander the Rastonian should not have been able to defeat the Persians. In fact, throughout human history, We have a lot of instances, cases, where smaller armies have been able to defeat much larger armies. So think of Genghis Khan, think of Mohammed, okay? So clearly this is wrong. But if this is wrong, what is the better way to understand military strength? Well I would argue how strong military is, is based on three criteria. The first is cohesion. Do the soldiers like and identify with each other? Are they united? Okay, cohesion. Second is idea of discipline. How well trained and experienced are they? And the third is devotion. How committed are they to winning? Okay, so if you want to see how powerful a nation is militarily, you have to ask yourself these three questions. Are they cohesive? Are they disciplined? Are they devoted? And I would also argue that each nation has a certain culture, a certain value system which gives it a certain character. And this character will tell you if they are likely to win a war or not. So let's examine briefly the characteristics of Rome as opposed to the Greeks and the Carthaginians. Okay, so let's do a table. Let's just say, okay, you have Greeks, you have Carthage, you have Rome. All right, we know a lot about the Greeks. And there are three major concepts that define Greek culture. Okay, all right, so the first question is, what makes you a good person? For the Greeks, it was the idea of erite. Erite just means excellence. You could be an asshole. You could be a jerk. But if you irritate, like you have talent, then you're a good person. And the irritate that the Greeks are most concerned about is the ability to speak well and the ability to fight well. That's irritate. Something is, what is the thing that matters to you? The most valuable thing in your life? Well, what do you fight? Well, for the Greeks, it was the idea of freedom. And for them, the idea of freedom means the ability to speak your mind in front of your peers. The freedom of speech, basically. And the last question for the Greeks is, what is the purpose of life? And here the Greeks have an easy answer. It's eudaimonia. Remember, eudaimonia is Greek for flourishing. You can only be happy as a person if you are achieving your true potential, if you are flourishing as a person. So that's great culture. And if you think about it, this explains why the Greeks were the most creative civilization in human history, right? They're very creative. At the same time, they're also very selfish, right? And that's why they were never able to come together, except in times of natural emergency, like when the Persians invaded. And only then, but even then, Only a few of the Greek city-states came together, and some even joined the Persians. So the Greeks are notorious for being creative, but also for being selfish, just Greek culture. Now let's look at the Carthaginians. Now, unfortunately, we don't know anything about the Carthaginians. The reason why is Rome wiped Carthage out of history. Rome destroyed Carthage, killed everyone, and erased Carthage from the history books. But we do know they are a mercantile empire, meaning they are focused on trade. We also know that in their political system it's the wealthiest citizens who have the most political power, okay? And so they are basically a merchant culture, a merchant, mercantile culture. And from that we can make certain guesses about their value system, okay? So what is good for the Constitutionians? It's the idea of being lucky, right? You succeed in life if you're lucky. That's how business people are, right? And that's why they're very superstitious. The Carthaginians are notorious for being extremely religious and superstitious. And one example of this is of all these major civilizations, the Carthaginians are known for practicing human sacrifice. In fact, in terms of war, they will even go as far as practicing child sacrifice, killing children, killing children and sacrificing them to the gods and we turn for divine favor in times of war. So they are known for focusing on fortune and luck. What do they care about? They care about their own interests, right? What's profitable? What's their purpose in life? Acupilating wealth. Does that make sense? Because these are business people, they're merchants. So that's how they structure their society and their culture. And that's why, for most of the history, they were extremely wealthy, okay? They were notorious for being extremely clever business people who made a lot of money for themselves. Rome, let's look at Rome, okay? What is good for them? What's a good person? The answer is piety. Piety just means duty to the gods, to the city, Rome, and to your father. They believe heavily in filial piety. The best person was someone who practice filial piety. What did they think was most valuable in their lives? It's the idea of liberty. But liberty is a different conception for the Romans than for the Greeks. Remember, for the Greeks, what mattered was the opportunity and the ability to speak your mind in front of your peers. That's what freedom was. The Romans believed liberty was about respecting the law, institutions, and the history of Rome. But it is only by restricting a law could you be free. Otherwise, we all just be savages. That's the conception of liberty. Now, the last question then is, what's the purpose of life? And for the Romans, what really mattered to them is the idea of re publica, re publica, this is Latin. And it's translated as usually public virtue for the public good. And this is where we get the term republic from. And so for Romans, the highest honor, the highest privilege, the purpose of life was to serve Rome and make it stronger and better. Doesn't make sense. Standing for political office and being head of the military was the highest honor Rome could bestow on you. That was the entire point of your life. Does that make sense? So if we just do a compare and contrast, we can easily figure out, oh, it's the Roman ethical system that will allow them the most cohesion, discipline, and devotion in their military. And therefore, over time in a war, the Romans should be able to defeat both the Carthaginians and the Greeks. Does that matter? Sorry, does that make sense to you? Any questions so far? Is this clear, my argument? Carthaginians. Yeah. Okay. All right, so Rome in the Third Pentecost War, from 149 to 146, they would go and destroy Carthage. They would burn it to the ground. And then they would burn all the books that Carthage ever produced. So we don't have anything written by them. But we have a lot written by Greeks and Romans, right? These are Greeks and Romans were always in conflict with the Carthaginians. And what's interesting for us is before all the Colossians started in about 300 BCE, the Romans and the Greeks had nice things to say about the Carthaginians. They were good fighters, they were brave, They were very prosperous. Carthage was like the wealthiest city in the world. They had all these praises for Carthage. And after when war started between the Carthaginians and the Romans, then they focused on child sacrifice. The Carthaginians were offended the gods because they practiced child sacrifice, which is barbaric and that's why the gods smited Carthage. Now, back at this time in human history, we didn't believe in human agency. Everything was ordained by the gods. So if caravans is destroyed, it's because the gods will it. Why do the gods will it? Because the caravans practiced child sacrifice. And that's what the Romans and the Greeks insisted. Of course, that means we have to be skeptical of what they say. But at the same time, we've done a lot of archeological excavations around Caravans. And we have found human remains that show signs of human sacrifice. So we have, we also, Carthage comes from Phoenicia, we know a lot about Phoenician culture. So we've lost a lot of information about Carthage, but we're able to piece them back together slowly. Does that make sense? All right. Okay, but again, unfortunately, we know nothing about their culture, right? We don't know nothing about their literature, about their mythology, about their religion, because it's all been destroyed. The writing has all been destroyed by the Romans. Okay, so these three characteristics that define the Roman identity, right? Piety, liberty, and very public up. I wanna explain them slowly, okay? So what the Romans really did well is they basically created history as mythology. So the Greeks separated mythology from history. Mythology is what the Greeks did, history is what humans did. So basically the Greeks invented history. The Romans, they basically elevate their history into mythology. Their history became their religion. So let me explain what I mean by that. So there are legends that surround the founding of Rome. So Rome was supposed to be founded in 753 BCE by Romulus. And there are legends surrounding Romulus. And there are lots of legends surrounding Romulus. But the idea is this. There was a king and he was over-formed by his brother. And the brother banished the king's daughter to a temple to be a virgin for the rest of her life. But then she got pregnant. And then so the brother says to the king's daughter, why are you pregnant? And the daughter says, I was visited by Mars, the god of war, and he impregnated me. Okay, the king's brother obviously does not believe her, so he banishes her and he orders for the twins were born to be killed. Okay? But as a case with these legends, the person charged with killing the twins takes pity on them, and somehow they are left to die in the woods. A she-wolf, a wolf, comes and nurses them before another shepherd comes and adopts them. Okay? Eventually, they realize who they are, and they help the king overthrow the brother and take back the throne. Now the brothers are asked to go and basically found their own city. So they go to Rome and it's all just hills, right? And they decide this is the place to build their kingdom because there's a river, the tiber, and there are all these hills that provide good defense. Okay? The problem is this, there's twins, there's two of them, Romulus and Remus. So and only one can be king. So they're so they can do a battle and Romulus kills Remus Okay, and that's the founding legend of Rome and from this legend we can sort of understand or Make some Exceptulations about the Roman psychology They believe that violence is at the core of human existence, right? I mean that like Sometimes you have to kill your own brother and that's the right thing to do because that is ordained by the gods. So that's the first legend. Second legend is this. Romulus has to build Rome and he becomes a very open person. He welcomes immigrants into Rome and he grants them citizenship and status right away. Rome becomes a nation of immigrants. Eventually their rise starves their neighbors and their neighbors go to war with not ones. The Romans are so good at war that they fight back on neighbors. The neighbors are called the sad lines. The sad lines decide, listen, we can't beat them in war, but at the same time, Rome only has males. Rome only has males. So we will just isolate Rome. Our daughters will not marry into Rome and in 20 years time, Rome will have no population. Okay? Romulus hears of this plan and he devices a strategy. What he does is he organizes a huge festival and invites all his neighbors. So fathers bring their daughters to attendance festival. At this festival, the women are kidnapped and they're basically raped. That night Romulus visits every one of these women and apologizes for what has happened and promised that they will be safe in Rome, that they are now citizens of Rome and therefore they will be protected by him personally, the king. The fathers and the brothers are obviously very upset about this. So they organized this huge army and they marched against Rome. The Roman citizens come out to face them in battle. And just as they're about to clash in battle, the woman come and run between them and beg the new husbands and their fathers and brothers not to fight. At this point, Romulus appears and says, he will make everyone a citizen of Rome. And by doing that, he basically doubled the population of Rome. Again, from this legend, we can understand the Roman psychology, which is everything can be sacrificed in the pursuit of Roman glory. And basically, to ensure that Rome survives. Because what matters is Rome, okay? It's the cult of Rome. All that matters is the survival of Rome. Morals don't matter, nothing matters. All that matters is the survival of Rome. So after this, Rome starts to grow slowly. And this is a period known as the Seven Kings. So there's Seven Kings who rule Rome and they do so for a very long time, about 200 plus years. And most of them are very, very good kings, except the last king. His name is Tarkinus, Tarkinius, Superbus. Superbus is Latin for arrogant, so he's often referred to as Tarkin, the proud. So Tarkinus, proud, he is, as his name suggests, a very arrogant king. What makes him arrogant is his hubris. He refuses to listen to nobility. In fact, those in nobility who challenge his authority often get killed. He has a second son, and the second son, he's a jerk. He likes to abuse his power. And one thing that he enjoys doing is raping the woman of Rome. There's one woman who's notorious, or who's famous, for her virtue, his name is Lucretia. And the prince thinks raping her will be the most fun, okay? because she will be the most insulted by this. So he rapes her, and then she goes and confronts her husband, okay, her husband. And her husband has a friend, his name is Lucius Brutus. Lucius Brutus happens to be the nephew of the king, and he is very much opposed to the tyranny of the king. And Lucucia says to her husband and to his friend Lucius Brutus, I've been raped, will you promise me to avenge my honor? And the husband and Lucia's Buddhist see she's distraught. And so they sue her and promise her they will do if they can in the morning. And Luquicia, she doesn't really believe them. So what she does is she takes a knife out from her dress and she stabs herself in the heart and she dies before them. Now they're honor bound to avenge her death. And so what Lucia's Buddhist does is He calls a meeting of the nobility and they decide to gather to overthrow the king. The king is out campaigning for war. And what they do is they lock the gates of Rome. Now the king is furious. Okay. And so what the king does is he decides he's going to go back to Etrusca where he's from and he's going to rally the other, his friends, the kings. Okay? Because if the Romans can overfowl him, well, other people can overfowl their kings, right? So this is a bad president. So he's going to organize a huge army to march against Rome. Meanwhile, Lucius Brutus, he's instituting the Republic. Okay? Now the king, the thing about the king is that all powers are invested in the king. These powers include military, judicial, deciding cases, legislative, making laws, administrative, bureaucratic, right? And religious, okay? So these are five major duties of the king. And this is where his power comes from. So what Lucius Brutus and the Romans do is they separate his powers not into individuals, but into institutions that are now elected by the people. Okay? This is the heart of republicanism. So the military will now run by the council. the council. The council is basically the head of the state. And again, he's elected. The judicial is run by the praetor. Legislator is the senate. Administrative is the ad-dial. And the religious is the pond effects maximus. And again, they're all elected by the people. Now what's important to understand is it's usually nobility who are in these offices. But back then, there was much separation between nobility and ordinary people. So nobility are what we call patricians, the patricians. And the ordinary people are what we call the plebiots. And honestly, there was not much difference. The patricians come from the longness, like the families who have been in Rome the longest, okay, the oldest families. And they were wealthy, but not much wealthier from ordinary Romans. So maybe you have one car, right? Well, I have three cows. Also, the people could go visit each other's homes without any ceremony, okay? So you could be the head of state, you could be the council, but if I'm an ordinary person, I can just come to your house and have dinner with you, okay? There were no doors, there were no guards, there was no separation, okay? So, Luusus put us, instituted a new system where the king's powers were divided among different institutions. And now people didn't have to obey the king, they had to obey the republic. The republic had, was three things. The laws, the history, or traditions, and institutions. Okay? That's the republic. This system unbelievably, incredibly will not change for about 500 years. Okay, so it's pretty stable. Now what's important to remember is these are not innovations. The Romans just basically copied this from the neighbors, the Etruscans. So the Romans have a republic. The problem with the republic is everyone's equal. And so if you come from a privileged background, you find this very annoying. So now there's a conspiracy to bring about the king. And this conspiracy was discovered and everyone was caught and imprisoned. It turns out Lucius Brutus has two sons. He has two sons. And they were both part of this conspiracy. They were tried by the Senate, and they were all sentenced to death, including the two sons of Lucius Brutus. The problem is this, the problem is the council has to oversee the execution of the prisoners. Whose council? Lucius Brutus's council. So Lucius Brutus has to oversee the execution of his two sons. Now, if Lucius Brutus is like, you know what, I'm gonna resign my office, or hey, you know what, I'm sick. Everyone would be like, we understand. Take the day off, don't worry about it, okay? Instead, Lucius Brutus showed up for work, and he oversaw the execution of his two sons. All of Rome came to the execution, okay? It was a public event. Everyone was watching the face of Lucius Brutus. Okay? We know that two sons are gonna die, they're gonna be headed, but everyone wants to see Lucius Brutus' reactions. He was crying throughout the execution. These are two sons, right? He has no more sons. This is his legacy now. And his two sons are about to be killed. In fact, he's the one charged with killing his own sons. He has to do it, he has no choice. So everyone's watching him. And throughout this process, he's crying. His tears are flowing down his face. He can't help himself, but he's still standing still and he's still slowly ordering the execution of his two sons. And the Romans are just shocked by this public display. This is the idea of devotion, right? You are so devoted to Rome that you're willing to sacrifice your own children to ensure its survival and its glory. Tarkinus, Tarkin the proud, here's what this, he gets really angry. So he allies himself with kings and they march against Rome. Lucius Brutus is council, he's in charge of military, so he marches his army against Tarkin the proud. One of the sons of Tarkin the proud sees Lucius Brutus and he charges ahead because he wants to kill the man who insulted his family. Lucius Buddha sees the king's son running, they're both on horses, right? Running, galloping towards him. And Lucius Buddha gets angry. And so he charges ahead as well. Lucius Buddha throws his spear, javelin. The king's son, the prince, throws his spear as well. And they spear each other to death. And they both die, okay? And so Lucius Buddha is, at this point, considered the greatest Roman whoever lived. And for most of Roman history, he'll be considered the greatest woman of whoever lived, until Julius Caesar. And it was in the memory and honor of Lucius Buddhist that they would assassinate Julius Caesar. But we'll discuss this next class. OK. So the king's army is overwhelming the Romans. And the Romans have to flee back into the city. There's a drawbridge that connects Rome to the mainland, okay? So the river, Tiber crosses it, crosses around Rome. There's a garrison that's supposed to be protecting the bridge, but they see the army coming, the army marching towards them. They get scared and they run all into Rome. One guy, he's called Cockles, he decides, I can't run away. Because I run away, the army just marches into Rome and kills everyone. So he decides to make a last stand. And it's just one guy. There's one random guy. And what he does is he starts shunning insults at the enemy army. He's like, you guys are slaves. We're Romans. We will always be free. And the enemy army, and there's thousands of them, OK? They have absolutely no idea what's going on. This is one guy on a bridge shunning insulting them, OK? So they freeze. Eventually they realized, oh, this guy is just distracting us because his friends, the other soldiers, are trying to cut down the bridge. So they run to him. At this point, two other Romans, okay? Two officers run besides cockles, and together the three of them hold off the invading army together, okay, with their shields. They fight for their lives. Eventually the bridge is about to be cut down. Okay? The two officers run away and cockles makes the last stand. And the bridge falls and what the cockles does is before it falls completely, he jumps into the tiber and he survives. He doesn't drown. So this tells us, Hey, anyone can be a hero of Rome. Right? It loses Brutus. He's the king's nephew. He's nobility. But cockles, he's just an ordinary Roman who had the courage. He had the devotion to fight for Rome. And by doing so, with his devotion, he's able to save Rome by himself. So Rome right now is surrounded by this huge army. And one young man, his name is Musius, and he's a Roman nobleman. He goes to the Senate and he says to the Senate, listen, we're being surrounded by an enemy army, the huge, we're starving to death. I have a plan to win this war. I'm gonna swim across the typer, sneak into the enemy camp, and kill the enemy king, and this war will end. The Senate gives Moussius his approval, and Moussius sneaks into the enemy camp. It's payday, which means the soldiers are getting their wages, right? Moussius sneaks into the front, and he sees on the podium, there are two individuals who are giving out wages to the soldiers. they both look like the king. Once a king and once a secretary, they look the same. Moosius doesn't know who's the king, he knows the secretary. You know, at this point, an ordinary person would be like, I'll come back later, okay? Like, let me figure out, let me spy first and figure out who the king is. And then when a better opportunity arises, I'll kill the king. Moosius is like, it's 50-50, man. So he takes his knife, rushes the podium and stops one of the men who happens to be the secretary. So he's arrested and the king is now interrogating him. He wants to know if there are other spies in the camp. The king says to Musias, tell me the truth or I will burn you alive. And he shows Musias the pyre, okay, it was this huge fire. Moushie says, I am one of a hundred young Romans who have pledged their lives to kill you to free Rome. He's lying, this is not true. You kill me, there'll be 99 more. We are not afraid of you. You say you will burn me if I do not tell you the truth. Now what he does is he puts his hand into the fire. His hand is burning, okay? And he holds it together. And what makes him pull together is what he sees is the face of Lucius' Buddhists as he orders the execution of his two sons, right? Because ordering the execution of your two sons is a lot harder than burning your hand alive, okay? Than burning your hand. And the king, he looks at this, and he thinks the Romans are the craziest bastards I have ever met. Screw this, I'm going home. And he lets Moses go, and the war's over. And that's how the Roman Republic survived the invasion and became the Republic. So this is the history of Rome. And this history is something that can be taught to anyone who becomes a citizen. If you are a Roman, it's because you believe in this history. Believing in this history, knowing this history, is what makes you a Roman, okay? So that's the first concept, piety, loyalty to Rome. Some concept that makes you Rome unique or powerful is the idea of liberty, okay? What Cobblestone did, what Mooshes did, what Lucius Buddhists did was preserve the liberty of Rome. Remember, what liberty means is respecting and following the laws, institutions, in history of Rome, because that's what makes Rome Rome. That's what allows you to have freedom. Okay? And that's why in 216, even though Hannibal had defeated the Romans, the Romans refused to surrender because surrendering would mean surrendering their liberty, right? Because Hannibal wouldn't impose peace terms. That would make basically Rome into a client state of Carthage. They would lose their liberty. All right? you know, on liberty, your life isn't worth living. Give me life or give me liberty, okay? The third element of Roman greatness is the idea of this, right? We're a public house, right? So what this means is every nobleman, if you have the ability, you want to serve Rome, okay? So what they did was this. They turned Roman politics into a competition to produce the best man, okay? It was basically a meritocracy. So once you have to find out the means, you stood for election. And this system was basically a meritocracy. You first stood for election to become an edile, and then you became a praetor, and then you became a council. Once you were a council, you had the opportunity to win the highest glory. What you could do is become a governor of a faraway province. And if you are going to this part of your province and you can win more territory for Rome, then you'll be given something called a triumph. Triumph. Triumph is a big parade where you are celebrated by all the Roman people. And that's what every Roman soldier aspired to, to become a great general who would receive his own triumph. But he sees one new territory for Rome. Okay? And that's why even though a third of the Roman Senate was wiped out by Hannibal, they didn't give up because the other people were like, okay, now here's my opportunity to prove myself. And one of these young people, his name is Scipio, he would go on and lead an army into Spain, conquer Spain, and then lead an army against Hannibal in North Africa, in Carthage, and destroy Hannibal. Okay? Because the point of life is to receive the triumph. And if you receive the triumph, then you will remember by Romans in their history, which is what gives your life meaning. Okay? All right, so do we understand these concepts? Piety, liberty and republica, because they are the essence of the Roman identity and they are what made Rome great. Sure. All right. All right, so sorry. Lucius Buddhist, okay? Lucius Buddhist overfooled the king and he established the Roman Republic. The Roman Republic is now a nation of laws. His two sons are princes and they lost their privileges. So they partake in this conspiracy to bring back the king. Right? This conspiracy was discovered and as punishment they were all sentenced to death because they wanted to destroy the Republic bring back the king. Does that make sense? So what's the story? Again, we don't know these stories are true. They're probably not true. What this story is telling us is if the founder of the Roman Republic can sacrifice his family in order to make sure the Republic survives, well, you can as well. No sacrifice, every sacrifice must be made to ensure Roman greatness. That's basically the message. Any more questions? That's a great question. Okay, so how do we know this? The answer is this. For most of this time, this is what we call oral history. Okay, so this is like, you know, mythology and it was basically passed from generation to generation. This oral history was written down in books. But because Rome was that were so much, Rome was conquered once, and Rome was burned down. And so we lost a lot of the written history. Now the problem with oral history is there are different versions of oral history. So there are different versions of these stories. And then a man named Livy, during the time of the Roman Empire when it was first founded, he sat down to write the official history of Rome and this is where we get all these stories from. And again, we don't believe these stories to be that true. There's probably, there's, Lucius was probably a real person, but whether he did these things we don't know. It's debatable. But what matters is, this is what Romans believed. What matters is what they believe as opposed to what really happened. And this is what creates the Roman identity. Great. Any more questions? Okay. So, yeah, I mean that's basically it, okay? This is what made Rome great and that's what allowed them to come back from the defeats that kind of all inflicted on them to eventually win the war. Any more questions? 80,000 army against Hannibal, yes. Okay, that's a great question, okay? So you wanna know more about Hannibal's invasion of Italy, right? Okay, all right. So Rome, what Rome is able to do is offer citizenship to anyone who fights for Rome. And Rome has for the longest time been fighting its neighbors, right? Once it conquered its neighbors, its neighbors promised to send soldiers to Rome in times of war. So Rome is able to draw on soldiers from all around the Italian peninsula. That's the first thing. Second thing is that when Hannibal invaded Italy, he was doing so with many Gauls, who are the invaders of Italy. And these Gauls have traditionally been the enemy of the Italians. So when Hannibal did so, Rome's neighbors rallied to Rome's support, to support Rome, okay? Because they saw the goals and Hannibal as invaders who threatened their culture, okay? That's the second thing. Now, third thing is, Hannibal had an invading army, right? But he had no organizational and logistic support. He had no food supply, because he was basically doing this on his own initiative. Carvedage is too far away, okay? And Rome had the best Navy in the Mediterranean. So there was no way that Carvedage could resupply Hannibal. Sorry, so there's no way Carvedage could resupply Hannibal, right? So Hannibal was forced to spend a lot of his time foraging for food, do you understand? And that's ultimately why he lost the war. Because it's possible for you to win all these battles because you're a military genius, but you still have to feed your soldiers. And what Rome did after the battle of Canaan was they recognized this fact. They recognized that Hannibal's main problem was logistics. And they started to not, they decided we will never fight Hannibal in a battle again. We will cut off his food supply. And so Hannibal had to spend most of his time forging for food. Meanwhile, Rome could rebuild itself by freeing its slaves, okay? and by recruiting more neighbors to join their cause. Does that make sense? That's why armies don't win wars. Nations win wars. Does that make sense? So another thing that you need to understand is, while Hannibal was winning glory in Italy, the kinds of elders in Carpets, Were they happy about this, do you think? These are business people, right? Or are they happy about this? They're not happy about this because one, it's gonna cost them a lot of money to continue the war. And listen, Italy is poor. So there's no profit to be made from conquering Rome. That's the first problem. Second problem is if Hannibal were to win glory in Italy, he would come back and make it some king of Carthage, right? Does that make sense? So Hannibal was being undermined by Carthage itself, even though Hannibal was trying to save Carthage. Does that make sense? And that's what makes Rome unique. Rome has been united for most of its history, whereas most places like Greece and Carthage were divided into different political factions. And that's what caused Carthage to ultimately be undermined. So, ultimately, Rome was able to come back from the defeat and defeat Carthage because Carthage again saw Hannibal as big a threat as Rome. This would be costly for Carthage because after the war is over, 50 years later, a Roman senator named Cato the Elder vits its Carthage because he's curious what's happened to Carthage after the end of the war. And to his dismay and to his shock, Carthage has become wealthier than ever before. 50 years of peace means that Carthage is able to accumulate more wealth than ever before. It has so much wealth that is able to pay off the indemnity that Roman posed on it. It's basically able to pay off, pay Rome off. And Kato, Kato the elder, he is traumatized by this. He goes back to Rome and says, we have to destroy Carthage. Okay, there's a huge debate in the Senate. He says, listen, we let Carthage survive. Carthage will always be a threat to us. And the other senators were like, listen Kato, I know you want to destroy Carthage, but remember Carthage threatens us. If we destroy Carthage, We Rome will no longer have an enemy. We will no longer have a threat. We will change as a people if we destroy Carthage. But Catelyn Elder insisted, and eventually an army was dispatched to destroy Carthage. The Romans have a habit of always blaming the enemies for starting a war, okay? So they didn't want to instigate the war. So they made these thumb excuses, instead of Carvitch was violating the peace treaty. And the Romans said to Carvitch, listen, if you surrender all your weapons, we will go away. The Carthaginians believed the Romans and thought if they surrender all the weapons, they go away. The Romans got all these weapons, they were like, we didn't expect this, man. So the Romans said to the Carthaginians, you know what, we also need you to move your city from the coast, 10 kilometers inland. And at this point, the Carthage is new. Rome was going to destroy Carthage. So there's a three-year siege, and then at the end of it, Rome conquered Carthage, killed everyone inside, enslaved others, burned all the books, and wiped out Carthage from history, as well as the history books. So that's a Roman mentality. Devotion means all or nothing. You don't surrender, but you also don't show mercy to your enemies. So Hannibal was right. Rome was a threat to Carthage. But because Carthage has a merchant culture run by business people, they could never recognize the threat. Does that make sense? Any more questions? Good. Public virtue. Okay, so why do people want to come to Rome? Well, the fact of the matter is that for most of history, for most of history, people didn't want to go to Rome because Rome was considered a, like for example, Greeks didn't want to go to Rome because they thought Rome was uncivilized. And Rome, but Rome is wanted to go to Athens because it thought Athens was a height of civilization, right? The Carthaginians certainly didn't want to go to Rome. Rome was like Macedonia. It's basically like North Korea, even. You can even say it's like North Korea, okay? It's a militaristic society that's barbaric, right? The Greeks like to watch theater, the Romans like to watch gladiator shows or lions eat people. So for most of its history, people avoided Rome. When becoming a republic, you had no choice but to go to Rome because that's how you could build your career, it was the capital of the world. Does that make sense? So another thing this is, there were many people who wanted to be Greek because they were attracted by the culture. And nobody wanted to be Roman. The Romans made everyone into a Roman through the conquest. So the Romans were repugnant in many ways. They just were a repugnant people. Any more questions? Any more questions? OK, great. So next class, it's a fun class. We do Julius Caesar. OK?"}

He is one of the mysterious figures in world history. He's one of the most famous, but he's one of the most mysterious. He's a paradox for three reasons, okay? The first reason is he is considered to be one of the greatest philosophers in human history. He's next to Plato. He's certainly as influential as Plato. But what is unique about him is We do not have anything originally written by him. We have no text that we believe was personally written by him. And that's unique in human history. We say Shakespeare was a great writer, and we can prove it or show it by reading his text. We believe Aristotle is a great thinker, a great writer, but we have no evidence, no text, to show us this is the case. but we believe so, okay? So this is the first paradox of Aristotle. Second paradox of Aristotle is, he was a very prolific writer and thinker. In fact, we believe he, there's about 200 works attributed to Aristotle. What is unique about his work is the range of his thinking and his research. So he's written a book on politics, right? What is the best political system? He's written a book on poetics, theater basically, what makes for a good tragedy? He's written a book on ethics. What is a good life? What makes a good person? He's written a book on rhetoric. How do you convince the audience that you are correct? He's also written books on physics. He's written in books on metaphysics. He's written in books on biology. The range is just incredible. We have no analog in human history like him. He's simply unique in the range of his curiosity. Second paradox. The third paradox is most problematic. We know that Aristotle studied under Plato for 20 years. And so we also believe that Aristotle was Plato's most famous student. The paradox is Aristotle's understanding of the universe is radically opposed to Plato's understanding of the universe. of the universe, okay? And that's, again, is unique in human history. You would think the best student would carry on the master's work or at least build on it, right? But Aristotle, his understanding of the universe, is in conflict with Plato's work. In fact, you could also argue that Aristotle is negating Plato's worldview, okay? So let me explain how. So we know Plato. We know that for Plato, there is a God and it's called the form of the good. And the form of the good is what is eternal, perfect, and immutable. Now, the form of the good emanates other perfections. What he calls the form of the ideal. So these are concepts like justice and beauty and reason. And then these concepts manifest themselves in forms like horse, right? Or a woman, okay? And these are like the ideal perfect immutable eternal manifestations, okay? So there's only one horse. It's up in heaven. Everything else is a copy of this horse or imitation of this horse, okay? So we live in the shadow realm, okay? the shadow realm, where everything is imitation. This is our reality, it's a shadow reality. And that's why art and poetry and theater are so bad because they are really an imitation of an imitation. So this is Plato's hierarchy. So from this hierarchy and this worldview, we can make certain extrapolations. The first extrapolation is for Plato, What is good is if you approach or return to the form of the good, what is evil, what is bad, is if you move away from the form of the good. So poetry is evil. Mathematics is good. Now, why is mathematics good? Because mathematics is what allows you to approach the form of the good. So let me give you an example of this. Let's say there's a circle. Now what Plato argues is no matter how hard you try, you could never, ever draw a circle in this world because a circle has an edge. So it's like literally impossible for you to create something without an edge. You're like, well, I can draw on a computer. But if you go at a microscopic level, you will always find an edge. So how do you create a circle? Well, you create a circle by imagining it in your head. So what you're really doing is you're imagining the circle because you're accessing the realm of the form. You're approaching from the good. So it is only through a process of pure thought, pure philosophy, pure mathematics that you can actually start to understand this world. that's Plato's understanding of the world. Aristotle has a completely different understanding. So Aristotle starts with this. That God's a prime mover. So the prime mover, just imagine a big bag, right? Something explodes, boom, it moves. And it forces other things to move as well. So what Aristotle is saying is everything is really in motion. Everything is changed. because it was all caused by the prime mover. And in Plato, in Aristotle's world, what is good is if the thing that changes moves towards its purpose, okay? Or the word he uses is called telos, telos. Okay, if you're moving towards your purpose, you are doing good in this world. If you're moving away from your purpose, you're doing bad in this world, okay? So the example is a soldier. The purpose of a soldier is to fight and win wars. So if you go fight and you do your best, you're doing good. But if you run away from a war, you're doing bad, okay? So this is Aristotle's worldview. And as you can understand, as you can see, these two worldviews cannot harmonize. They are in conflict with each other. You have either one or the other, okay? So let me highlight the three major differences between these two worldviews. And again, I need to emphasize this. I am not an expert on Aristotle, I'm not an expert on Plato. So I am committing oversimplifications. Scholars who are experts will hear this and be outraged. But for the purpose of this class, I feel these oversimplifications provide clarity. Okay? All right? So the first oversimplification is, play us what we call a rationalist. A rationalist is what we call an empiricist. All right? So these are two big words. But the rationalist is just someone who believes that you can access the truth through peer thought, okay, mathematics. And empiricist is someone who believes you can only access the truth through observation and what we call induction, okay? Inductive logic. So if I see a woman wearing a dress and I see another woman wearing a dress and a third, I'm like, okay, well from this I can logically deduce or induce that all women wear dresses and that's what separates woman from men, okay? So for Aristotle, to seek the truth, you have to observe and you have to induce, okay? So that's the first major difference. Second major difference is, Plato's word called a dualist. And Aristotle is what we call materialist. A dualist is someone who believes that there's a body and a soul. And if you believe there's a body and a soul, you also believe the soul is more important because the soul is eternal, whereas the body will decay and die. Aristotle, he's materialist. So for him, the focus is on the body and what happens to the body. There may be a soul, there may not be a soul. He doesn't really care. For him, it doesn't really matter. What matters is what happens to the body. The third major difference is Plato believes in the idea of immutability, okay? Or we're called eternity. For Aristotle, almost nothing is immutable. Most things are mutable, okay? The only thing that's really immutable is really God. But everything else is mutable. It will change over time. And so for Aristotle, the concept is infinity. Things will always change, things will always move. There's no stopping movement. But for Plato, things are eternal. There's a grand design. And nothing that changes really matters. It doesn't really affect the grand design. So for him, it's eternity. So these are the three major differences between Plato and Aristotle. Now what's really interesting for us is this conflict between Plato and Aristotle is what will inform the philosopher debate for all questions of civilization. So there are two major camps in Western philosophy. There is the rationalist camp. So people like Descartes. And then there are the empiricists. So people like David Hume. And for most of Western history, philosophers will go back and forth between these two extremes. either platonic ideal or the Aristotle reality, okay? Does that make sense? All right? Is this clear? Any questions? Sure, go ahead. Yeah, so that's a great question. And for Plato, okay, what we, like our lives, the reality we live in is not real. It's ephemeral. Whereas the formula good, that's what's concrete. That's what's eternal, okay? So I mean like I understand that's counterintuitive to us. But the reason why it's counterintuitive to us is because we're mainly influenced by Aristotle, right? We are materialists, right? Science is materialistic. But back then, and I would say back then in Plato's time, and for most of his history, it was assumed that our world was transitory or transient or ephemeral, OK? And it was a spirit world, OK? That was real and that was eternal. Does that make sense? Again, this is oversimplification. Like if you go to a scholar who understands itself, I will probably criticize me. But I'm saying that for the purpose of this class and for our understanding of Western civilization, this will do. Just understand there's a major conflict between Plato and Aristotle. This will go on for thousands of years. This will inform the debate in Western civilization. This is the fundamental debate in Western philosophy. So let's summarize where we are. Aristotle is a paradox. We have nothing that he wrote originally. The range of his work is just incredible. It's unique in human history. And then lastly, even though we know Aristotle certainly underplayed over 20 years at least, Aristotle came up with a very different conceptualization of the universe. In fact, it is in direct conflict with Plato's understanding. So how is this possible? How are these paradoxes? How can we resolve these paradoxes? So I'm going to make an argument. And I will slowly make this argument, but it is a controversial argument. My argument is that Aristotle was not a philosopher. He was not a thinker. He was not a writer. What he was ultimately is what I refer to as a sensor. Sensor. You can also use words like synthesizer, okay? Or editor. Or systemizer, okay? But basically, nothing that he thought was original to him, but he decided what would be political convenient for the moment, okay? That's what we mean by sensor. And it's my argument that if we understand Aristotle's sense war, then these three paradoxes go away. We can explain away these paradoxes. So let me make my argument. OK, my first piece of evidence is we need to compare contrast, the life of Foucault Sack and Massivon, and Aristotle. When you do that, when you put their lives side by side, interesting parallels emerge. So let's look at your last verse simple. Aristotle, he was born in year 384. Philip II was born in year 383. That's about the same age, right? Now, Philip II, he's a prince of Masson. His father's the king, right? Aristotle, his father was the court physician to the king. He was the king's personal doctor, right? So from these two pieces of information, what can we guess about Philip and Aristotle? They grew up together. Does that make sense? Aristotle's father was the personal doctor, the king. Philip was the son of the king. It would make sense. They grew up together. It would make sense. It would be educated together. Second thing that's interesting is from 367 to 348, Aristotle went to Athens to study in Plato. Now around the same time, okay, in year 369 to 365, Philip went to Thebes to study military innovation under the best journals in Greece. All right? And here I would extrapolate and say the teenagers, they're going to further their education, right? And learn the best scientific and military innovations in order to bring back the master law. And this happens all the time, right? In the 1980s, China sent its best and brightest to America to study science. So we can also surmise that even while they were away, they were still in contact with each other. Now, in 359, Philip became Regent or basically King and from then on, he started this massive military campaign to conquer all of Greece. Now, one thing that was interesting about Philip's conquest of Greece was, at the Athenians, didn't really oppose him. And this is one of the great mysteries historians struggle with. Why is it that Philip II, he's going around, he's conquering all these places that are in conflict with Athens. And Athens doesn't really resist. And one possible theory is, well, Philip II just bribe all these Athenian aristocrats. In fact, the man who most opposed Philip, this Athenian statesman named Dimesvini, actually said this in speeches. He said, listen, I'm telling you right now, Philip tried to bribe me. And I know Philip is bribe all my opponents. But I'm telling you, Athenians, Philip is a manist to democracy. And that's why we must oppose him. So we can surmise that Philip was braving these Athenians to support him, and that's why there's so little Athenian resistance to Philip. And that's the case. Then who's the middle man? Who's the person who's in contact with these Athenian aristocrats? Aristotle, right? Why? Because remember, Aristotle was at the academy for 20 years. The academy in Athens at that time is like Harvard, Oxford today, right? It's where all the rich and powerful go to study. So for 20 years, Aristotle was in contact and became friends with the most powerful individuals in Athens. And that's why when Philip needed to negotiate with Athenians, it would make the most sense to send Aristotle. Does that make sense? And then we know that Philip united Greece in 338 and then three, three, five, three years later, Aristotle started a new school in Athens in competition mechanics called the Lyceum. So what is the purpose of the Lyceum? That's what I will discuss next, but it doesn't make sense. There are direct parallels between the lives of Aristotle and Philip. And we can guess or extrapolate or deduce that Aristotle and Philip were very close throughout their lives and they were helping each other. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, so now the question then is, what was Philip going around conquering all of Greece? Well, Philip had a vision for the world and it's called something called, we call it the Pan-Hellenic Project. So Pan-Hellenic Project. Okay, so at this time and throughout most of its history, Greece was divided into city-states all around the world. Mainly in Greece, but also across the Aegean in Asia Minor and Atolia, okay? Across all these different islands and into North Africa and across the Adriatic, also into Italy as well, okay? So you have this sprawling Greek world. And there were many who believed that this Greek world should unite together because there's a common ancestry. All right, so it was a dream of many philosophers that a great man of history would arise and unite all of Greece by basically defeating Persia. And Philip II said, hey, that's a great idea and it should be me, okay? But the problem is the Panathenaic project assumes a common Greek identity, and it didn't really exist at that time. In fact, Greeks probably had more common with their local cultures than with each other, right? So if you were a Greek living in Asia Minor, you were probably more Persian than you were Greek. So in other words, Philip needed someone, a sensor basically to create a Greek identity. And the way you do that is by taking all this vast universe of knowledge that the Greeks created, right? And you create an encyclopedia or a series of textbooks that define what it means to be Greek, right? You sterilize and you systemize Greek knowledge. Doesn't make sense. And so that's probably what Aristotle was doing when he started the Lyceum. He had lots of students. Yeah, so throughout history all conkers did this. Because that was the only, because by standardizing and systemizing knowledge was the best way for you to co-opt the elite and to showcase your legitimacy. Otherwise, the intellectual elite would think of you as a barbarian conqueror. And the best way that you co-op the intellectual elite is by showcasing a new systematic knowledge. Does that make sense? All right, so the problem is that in 336, Philip was assassinated and his son, Xander, came to a throne, came to a throne. And as we discussed last class, Alexander had a very different vision from his father. His father wanted to unite the Greek world. Alexander wanted to conquer the entire world to show he was superior to his father. Okay? And unbelievably, incredibly, he was able to do so, conquer most of the world in about 10 years time. So now suddenly, You have this sprawling empire all around the world. So let's just sketch out how vast this new empire was. So you have Greece and Macedon. So that's the Greek homeland. Thank you. That's a Greek homeland. But hey, over here you have Anatolia. This is Mesopotamia. Over here is Afghanistan. Oh, sorry, sorry, it should be Iran, sorry. Iran, Afghanistan. And you also reach as far as Pakistan, okay? And down here you have the Levant and you have Egypt. All right? This was not supposed to happen. Philip and the Panhandic Project imagine like their conquest would extend up to around here, okay, because you're a United Greek world. Abyssinian went too far and now you're, you've conquered most of the known world, okay? Then Abyssinian died and then the empire was divided into three major fragments. Over here you have something called the Integanid Empire, okay, the Integanid Dynasty, okay? So that's one peace of the empire. Down here you have Ptolemy. Ptolemy was one of Abyssinian's generals and he took over Egypt. And over here, you have something called the Seleucid Empire, founded, of course, by the general Seleucids. And over here, you have other smaller kingdoms as well. So you have this vast empire. And this is something that was unplanned and unexpected. Now that you've conquered these places, your concern or your problem is how do we govern? So you need a new culture. And so these different generals adopted different strategies. So for example, here the Persian culture is extremely well established and the Seleucid king and his heirs decided a process of localization. Or another word we can use is synchronization. syncretization, meaning two different religions or two different cultures come together and coalesce together. So throughout the Seleucid Empire, it was really a process of syncretization. The Greeks adapted themselves to local customs and to local culture. At the same time, the Greeks were conquerors. So they still need to maintain a coherent identity. So it made sense for them to adopt a lot of Aristotle's work. Because remember, Aristotle was creating a panhellenic identity. And so he basically created a lot of textbooks. He basically created an encyclopedia. So it made sense for them to import Aristotle's works. Also what's important is, remember, Aristotle was Macedonian. And for the longest time, Greeks did not consider Macedonians to be Greek. This is why it's called the Pan-Hellenic Project, not to be like the Pan-Greek Project. Also, Greeks were very kind of setting towards Macedonians because they saw Macedonians as barbarians. So it was in the best interest of these new Macedonian conquerors to exaggerate or to highlight the intellectual contributions of Aristotle. Does that make sense? All right? Ptolemy Egypt was very different. Egyptian culture has been around for thousands of years. And the Egyptians are very proud of their culture. And this is a problem because you're very proud of your local culture. You don't like foreign rulers. And this is something that the Persian Empire struggled with throughout the centuries that it dominated Egypt. The Persians were famous for their openness and tolerance. Basically, you were allowed to practice your own religion. And they're very supportive of that, okay? The most famous example are the Jews, right? Who the Persian supported in rebuilding the second temple. Well, we'll get to the Jews later on. But because the Persians were so supportive on local culture in Egypt, the Egyptians rebelled against Persia many, many times. So, Tami and his hearers didn't want to make the same mistake, okay? They wanted to impose a new culture on the Egyptians in order to show that they were superior and therefore more divine than Egyptians. Okay, so Tommy, he did many things that started this process. The first thing that he did was he stole Alexander's body from Babylon, where he died, and brought it back to Egypt. Okay, because Egyptians saw Alexander as a god, as the son of a god, right? So to establish legitimacy in Egypt, Tommy went on a military expedition and stole the body of Alexander, which started something called the War of the Diochai, okay? Basically the Successor Wars. That's the first thing he did. Something that he did was he established a new capital in Alexandria called Alexandria. Okay? So this was mainly a Greek city, it was a new Greek city, followed by Alexander. And this is where they house Alexander's body. The third thing that he did was he started to sponsor something called, we call today the Moussion. Okay? The Moussion is the root of the English word museum. But the Muzon was really the world's first research university. So Ptolemy and his hear brought together the greatest Greek scholars in the world to basically continue the work of Aristotle to standardize and systemize Greek culture so that they can impose it on the local Egyptian culture. Does that make sense? And the most famous aspect of the Mujian is the Library of Alexandria. And the Tommy spent a lot of money on the Library of Alexandria, mainly by going around and collecting original manuscripts. So a representative went to Athens and said, we at the Library of Alexandria would like the original copies, the original manuscripts, for Ishelis, Sophocles, and Euripides, three great playwrights. And the Athenians are like, we can't do that because they're like gods here, okay? We're not gonna give you original manuscripts. And the Egyptians said, all we're gonna do is we're gonna take these manuscripts back to the library of Alexandria, where our scribes will copy them out, okay? That's all we're gonna do. And then we'll give it back to you. And as a guarantee, we're gonna give you like 15 talents of silver, okay? And that's like a billion dollars back then. But Athenians have never seen so much money. So Athenians will say, well, okay, well, if it's just to spread great culture, we can actually deal with that, okay? So we'll take the deposit, 15 talents, and we'll give you the manuscripts. The Egyptians took the manuscripts, placed it in the Library of Alexandria, and said, hey, Athenians, keep the money, okay? Because the Egyptians, under Ptolemy, were focused on turning the Library of Alexandria and Alexandria into the intellectual capital of the Greek world. And so what happened was that after Exeter died and the generals took over, the Pan-Hellenic project really became what we call the Pan-Hellenistic project. It went from uniting the Greek world into spreading Greek culture all around the world. And that's why we have Greek culture still with us today. because of this process. So let's go back to the original paradox. Why there are three paradoxes, right? The first paradox is why do we have nothing original from Aristotle? The answer is because Aristotle didn't write anything original, he stole everything from other thinkers. And he had his students copied out in manuscript form. It doesn't make sense. Second is why are his works so diverse? Why is the rain so great? The answer is because he was trying to cap to the essence of Greek knowledge. He was trying to unify Greek knowledge into an encyclopedia for dissemination around the world. The third thing is, the most interesting thing is, why is Aristotle's philosophy so different from Plato's worldview? Okay, that's a really interesting question. Why are they so different? So let's switch our perspective and ask ourselves, if you were a king of Massima, if you were Philip or Xander, what's your problem with Plato's philosophy? You have a problem, what is it? Any guesses? You're Xander, you're Philip. You really hate Plato, why? Why? Well, the problem with Plato is, you go to Plato, you're Xander, you go to the player who says, I wanna conquer the world. The player would say, what's the point? It's all not real, Alexander. You're just wasting your time. You can conquer the world, but all you're doing is conquer a shadow. What's real is the form of the good. Alexander, study mathematics, man. Do more math. Stop going around and killing people. Let's do more math, right? And we know what Alexander would do here, right? Alexander would probably cut off Plato's head. So Alexander felt hate this thing, right? This thing is idiotic. I wouldn't call it the world, but this philosophy is telling me it's pointless. What matters is mathematics. What matters is philosophy, right? Now, let's now compare this with Aristotle's prime mover theory, right? So what I started saying is, every emotion and what is good is if you fulfill your purpose. Now if you're Alexander or Philip, this makes more sense. I'm Philip, my purpose is to unite the Greek world. And the more I unite, the more good I'm doing for this world. Also, if you're a king, you want your citizens, your soldiers, your workers to work hard. Well, for Plato, working hard is just useless. You're imitating an imitation, right? When you create art. But here, working hard is what gives you purpose. It's what gives you happiness, okay? So Aristotle also promoted two major concepts. The first is erite, second is eudaimonia. Erite is just excellence, okay? Your Alexander has Eritée because he is an excellent general. When you have Eritée and you are achieving your purpose, then you achieve Eudaimonia, which is flourishing or happiness, and that's the purpose of life, to have Eritée and to achieve Eudaimonia. So work hard, fight for Alexander, support him as he conquers the world because he's making the world better. It doesn't make sense? Okay, that's a great question. Yeah, thanks Doug. Okay, all right. So the question then is, if I'm a soldier and I'm working hard and winning battles, am I not approaching from the good? And the answer is for Plato, it's not. The reason why is, what do you do in this material world is pointless, okay? Because in this material world, it's not real. So whatever you do is not real. Does that make sense? So what you need to do is return to the form of the good. But your body can't do that. Your soul can do that. So your use of the body is pointless. You have to use your soul, you have to use your mind. Therefore you have to be a good person. Therefore you have to engage in philosophy and mathematics. And that's how you return to the form of the good. You're used to the body, it's just you're just diluting yourself, okay? And if you engage in art, then you are diluting others and that's more evil. If you're ex-andering your conquering others and forcing them to believe your fake philosophy, then you're committing the most evil in the world. Does that make sense? All right, all right. So yeah, all right. So this is my theory of how to best resolve the three paradoxes of Aristotle. Does that make sense? There's basically a sensor who is working for Philip and Alexander. And he was trying to develop a pan-Hellenic identity in order to unite the world they conquer. So that's my argument. Any questions about this overall argument? Does it make sense to you guys? OK. Go ahead. Yeah, thank you. All right, go ahead. That's a great question. Yeah, okay. All right, so how do we know he didn't write any of his works? The answer is this. When you write something, you're actually manifesting your thought, right? But your thought comes from your personality. So if you look at any work of genius, it's original and unique. Okay, does that make sense? In other words, if you read Shakespeare, guess what? There's no other Shakespeare in the world. If you're trying to imitate Shakespeare, you look like an idiot. Homer is unique. Plato is unique. There's no point in trying to imitate them. You can't do it because you are not them, okay? Now, when you look at Aristotle, there's something unique about Aristotle. So, you know, when you read Plato, the Republic, there are certain ideas that stand out, like, I like the cave, okay? There's certain phrases that capture your imagination. That doesn't exist with Aristotle's text. They're really like textbooks. So the argument for the longest time was, Aristotle did write his own books, but they were lost to us. And his students had to reassemble his thinking from their own memory. So yeah, that's how we know. But this is generally agreed upon. we have nothing that Aristotle wrote originally. That's right. Yeah, okay, so thank you, Doug. Yeah, so there are many different possibilities of how Aristotle can become so influential. The first possibility is, as I argue, he was actually a partner of Phillips, that they were both trying to promote the Pan-Heletic Project. That's the first possibility. But another possibility is, as Doug says, he was just a philosopher, he was a student of Plato's, he was very smart, and he was a very good teacher. And after Alexander and his generals conquered the world, they needed a symbol of Macedonian cultural superiority. And they just decided upon Aristotle because it was most convenient, right? So that's another possibility, okay? That's right. Yep, exactly. So yeah, so it is entirely possible that Aristotle was a materialist because that was just his personality, right? The influence from his father who was a physician, okay? But that creates another problem, which is if you are so opposed to Plato's understanding of the world, right, because you're a materialist and he's a dualist, why were you studying under Plato for 20 years? Does that make sense? So that creates a never-pombed. All right, so another thing I want to point out is, okay, how we have Aristotle's work today. There are three different possibilities, okay? The first possibility is that Aristotle, in his lifetime, he organized his students and created this encyclopedia. Okay, and it's no different from professors at universities today, right? Professors who are scientists, they actually do very little of the original research. They have their students do it. they want to supervise the entire process. So it's possible, that's the first possibility. Aristotle was supervising the work of creating a Greek identity. The second possibility is after Aristotle died, his students started to remember, recall his lectures. And that's why so much of his work is ferventory. We don't have complete manuscripts. And the third possibility, and it's entirely possible, is Aristotle is a fiction created by scholars at the Library of Alexandria. So there's really the scholars at the Library of Alexandria who created Aristotle. And they did so by synthesizing all this work. And then they gave it to, they attributed it to Aristotle in order to create the legend of this philosopher. OK? Does that make sense? So let's have an argument about confusion. Let's have this because we're confused, okay? But I want to very quickly talk about the Greek legacy. Because even though we can argue back and forth about Aristotle and his provenance, what is not debatable is the profound influence that Aristotle had on the world, okay? We can argue if Aristotle was the original writer or the original thinker, but what is not debatable is tremendous influence he had on the entire world, okay? So there are three aspects of the Greek legacy I want to discuss. The first aspect is the Greeks created a new way of being human, all right? So let's look at the major thinkers. You have Homer, you have the playwrights, Ischelis, Sophocles, and Eurbides, and you have the philosophers, like Plato and Aristotle. All right, so the Greeks created a new way of being human. What do I mean by that? Homer was an oral bard. He would get up in front of audiences and he would for hours recite this beautiful poetry about the Trojan War, the Iliad. And in the process, listen to Homer, credit, empathy, and imagination. Because the point of listening to Homer was to enter Homer's world and become Achilles' Odysseus. And through this process, you become a different person. And therefore, you learn empathy, but you also expand your imagination. So that's what Homer did for the Greeks. Then you have Ischelius, Sopholes, and Europides. And what they did that was different is rather than sink directly at the audience, they had the characters face each other in a dialogue and a debate. Okay? And by doing this, what happens is you create the capacity for perspective and inner debate, right? Because before you were part of the story. Now you have to step back and judge the story. Okay? There's a debate going on. You have to switch perspectives in order to understand the characters. And this creates the capacity for an inner monologue, okay? And in a debate in you. And then you have Plato and Aristotle. What Plato did that was unique was he took all the dialogue in the play and he transported onto the page. But now you read it by yourself and you have the benefit of time, okay? And so this creates a capacity for reason and reflection. Okay? You can sort of reason out if the words make sense to you. You are no longer influenced by the crowd or the emotions of the actor. You can just look at the words themselves and judge them on their own narrative. You also have the capacity now to reflect, meaning you can go back to the words over and over the course of your lifetime to constantly reflect on their meaning and logic, okay? Here's that. So when you add these three things together, Homer create the capacity for empathy and imagination. The playwright create the capacity for inner debate and perspective. The philosophers create the capacity for reason and reflection. You now have a new human mind, okay? And when you study all of them, this is what we call ultimately a liberal arts education. All right? And guess what? Our greatest thinkers came to us through the liberal arts. So in the future, we'll study people like Kant, Hume, Hegel, just the greatest thinkers of the past 20 years. They all, what was common about them is they all read the Greeks. And now it's just their education. So this is the first legacy of the Greeks, a new way of being and seeing. Okay, does that make sense? Second thing is, now that you have this Greek world, the Greeks need to establish a cohesive cultural identity. And they did that by promoting a Greek education. Okay? But not only that, but they had to bring in local people into this education. So one major function of the Library of Alexandria was to standardize and systemize Greek knowledge. And they did this by standardizing the text. So there are different texts of Homer. The text of Homer that we have today was developed by the people at the Library of Alexandria. Standardization. They also did something called commentaries. So commentaries are basically like teacher handbooks. they teach you how to teach stuff. And they create like footnotes and chapters and page numbers, codices, indexes, okay? So the point was to make Greek education available and accessible to anyone, all right? And what this means is we in China now can actually read Homer, Ischulis and Plato for ourselves, even though we are not culturally Greek. and that's the benefit of the Pan-Helitistic project. And the third major benefit is Greek knowledge meant a global revolution in innovation. What I mean by that is, remember, Greek knowledge is being spread around the world and they're interacting with powerful local cultures And through the process of synchronization, new forms of knowledge are being created. Okay? So the Greeks spread the knowledge to India and now it's enacting with local Indian philosophy and religion, including new ideas, right? So the most famous synchronization is the Levant. Great knowledge was being spread to the Jews. Okay? And so when you put the Greeks and the Jews together, you have a new idea that would forever revolutionize human history and it's called Christianity. So Christianity would not have been possible if it were not for the work of Aristotle. So those are the three major legacies of the Greeks. And so it is, I think it's perfectly fair to say the Greeks were the most influential and consequential civilization of all time. They were certainly the most creative. No other civilization even comes close to their creativity. Okay, so that's it. Any questions? Okay, so, okay. So we are finished with the Greeks. Next class, we start a new unit on Rome, Roman history. All right, so great."}

So the United States and Israel are committed to a policy of regime change in Iran. Hopefully they would like to assassinate the Ayatollah Khomeini because that would trigger a succession crisis in Iran. Right now their main strategy is to decrease the legitimacy of the regime in Iran. The best way to do that is to decrease the capacity of the state to deliver basic services. For example, water. So what's happening in Terran right now, a city of 10 million, is there's a water shortage. Because of heat, because of economic sanctions, because of our population, Terran is having problems ensuring water supply to its people. You can bet good money that this release in Americans will take advantage of that to engage in economic sabotage. Basically trying to destroy as much of Iran's critical water infrastructure as possible. They would want to basically create a famine, a drought. Now, the irony of that is that by engaging in this economic sabotage, the Iranian people will develop a greater resolve to resist. And once the resolve, once the will to fight has been increased to a certain level, then the Iranian government can close off the straight up of Homoos, which would compel an American ground invasion. And in America where to do that, America where to send in ground troops. And as I've said in multiple videos before, the American military would lose this war. Okay, so that's how I see the war developing over the next few months. Today, I wanna talk about what the future's gonna look like next 10, 20 years. I wanna take everything we've learned so far and combine it into a grand thesis about how the world would develop. And the argument I wanna make to you today is that eschatology drives geopolitics. And to make this argument, I'm gonna ask three questions. First question is, why are eschatologies so compelling? Second question is, What are the major eschatological traditions and how do they converge together? And the third question is, based on these convergence points, what can we predict about the future? Right, so let's look at the first question, which is why are eschatologies so compelling? And as I've said before, eschatologists are compelling because they are narratives that capture the human imagination. They answer three fundamental questions. Where do we come from? What are we doing here? Where are we going? It's a complete story on to itself. You can think of eschatology as scripts, really. Scripts that have a momentum of their own. Scripts that allow for unconscious coordination. Scripts that present roles for individuals to audition for. So just by participating in the script, you are helping the eschatology progress forward. And to understand why eschatologies are so powerful, please remember the universal law of game theory. In a previous video, I discussed how people win in the game. And the formula that tells us who wins a game is mass times energy times coronation. As I also said in that video, conspiracies, there are plenty of conspiracies, but they're not that effective because it's very hard to maintain secrecy. You can't maintain possible deniability. And because everyone has an ego, it's hard to maintain cooperation because everyone's fighting for his or her best self-interest. But with an unconscious coordination, which is what an eschatology provides, that allows for secrecy, possible deniability, and frictionless cooperation. And that's why eschatologists are so powerful. Now some of you may hear this and think this doesn't make any sense because it's really individual self-interest that motivates us. And what's really important to understand is these things as pathologies and individual self-interest are not in conflict with each other. In fact, they reinforce each other. Now in school, you may be taught that to succeed in life, you have to work hard, you have to be talented, you have to get good grades in school, and you have to be very intelligent. Certainly that's what I believed. And it took me 20, 30 years to recognize I was wrong. It's not what you know, it's who you know. To succeed in life, you have to be able to work with others in a signative, unconscious, coordinated manner in order to achieve certain goals. And that's what eschatology provides. So when you describe to an eschatology, when you commit to an eschatology, will help you achieve wealth and power. So that's why eschatologies are so compelling and so powerful. Not only do they capture our imagination and inspire us to collect their action and sacrifice, they also benefit us materially. Okay, so let's move on to the second question which is what are the major eschatological traditions out there and how do they converge? So before I go into the six major traditions, I want to remind everyone of three caveats. The first caveat is that within each religion, the eschatology is only a minority extreme view. Okay? Only a small minority of religious devotees actually believe in the eschatology. That's the first caveat. The second caveat is that there's tremendous diversity within each eschatology. You can interpret the eschatology allegorically, which is saying that it's compelling you to a path of personal redemption and salvation in order to improve the world, or you can interpret it literally, which is that this is a true prophecy and everything in it will happen in order for the world to end or for the world to become a better place. And also there are different sequencing of events and different interpretations in the eschatology. So that's the second caveat. Eschatologies within each tradition are very diverse and the third caveat is that eschatologies are dynamic. The reason why is Eschatologies are in conflict, are in competition, in communication with different eschatologies. Think of eschatologies as stories that are trying to be the best possible story in order to capture the imagination of their believers. And to do that, they're going to incorporate the best elements from different eschatologies into their own. And that's why so many of these eschatologies They follow a similar pattern because they've been learning and adapting from each other. Okay, so having said these three caveats, let's go into the six major astrological traditions. And I'm going to focus on the most extreme version of each tradition because according to game theory, it's the fanatics who matter. It's the fanatics who are the most energetic, when those committed to achieving the eschatology. So the first eschatology is Zoroastrianism, which was the original eschatology. In the Zoroastrian tradition, there's the world is divided into good and evil, the light and the darkness, the truth and the lie. And at the end of the days, there'll be a final battle between these two cosmic forces. And as humans, we must choose which side to fight for. At the end of this battle, when good has triumphed, there will be a day of judgment. And this structure, this cosmology heavily influenced Judaism. And so in the Judaic tradition, because Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years, They believe that eventually a Maasai of war will come to them. And he will lead the Jews to victory against all the enemies. He will... We constitute the nation of Israel and bring back all the Jews from the diaspora. He will build the third temple and he will usher in the Masenic Age of peace, prosperity, truth, justice. That's the Judean tradition. The Judean tradition went on to influence the Christian Zionist or the Protestant tradition. So the Protestants believed that the Messiah is Jesus and He's already come. So in order to usher in His second coming, certain conditions have to be met. First condition is the nation of Israel has to be reconstituted and it was in 1948. Then the third temple has to be built and there has to be a war of Gog and Magog. The Antichrist has to appear. And once these conditions are met, then to save his people, Jesus will descend from heaven on a cloud, destroy all his enemies and usher in a millennium of peace, truth and justice before the final judgment. When Jesus returns, there will be a rapture where all Christians will immediately ascend to heaven. So that's the Christian Zionist, Protestant tradition. And again, this is the most extreme form of that tradition. Then you have the Islamic tradition, which is based both on the Judaic and the Christian tradition. And it's very similar. So the Muslims believe that after an age of tribulation, when the world has turned its back on God, when the world is divided, a great leader will come to unify the people and lead the people to victory in the war of Gog and Magog. Gog and Magog is interpreted as the Antichrist and Gog and Magog can be interpreted as maybe Western civilization for its materialism but it could also be a certain force. So for example, maybe the city of London. So that's the Islamic tradition. Then you have the Orthodox tradition which is what we talked about in the last video. The Orthodox tradition believes that Moscow is a third Rome and has a destiny to restore the Baijin Empire. And to achieve this destiny, Moscow will fight a war with Turkey, it will destroy Turkey, and then we turn the Greeks to Constantinople, thus restoring the Bosnian Empire and thus unifying the Orthodox Christian world. Now what's really interesting is that there is a Geoproteurist named Alexander Dugan who's which turned this eschatology into a master plan for Vladimir Putin to implement. If you don't know who Alexander Dugan is, you have to watch his interviews, you have to read his books, because he's probably the most important geo-strategic thinker we have today. I'm gonna put his videos and his books in the description below, so please make sure you spend the time to actually research him, because so much of what he says helps us understand the world as it is today and how the world would develop over time. So in 1997, Dugan published a book called Foundations of Geopolitics where he describes this master plan for how Moscow can restore the Byzantine Empire. So what he understands is that for the longest time, whoever controls the seas controls the world because most trade was done through sea. But in a time of nation states, in a time of railways, if one power can unite the Europe and Asian continents into the Eurasian continent, then that power can negate sea power and become the global hegemon. And that's why the British, the British Empire, are committed to two things. The first thing they committed to is maintaining naval power. The second thing they committed to is ensuring that no major power would arise in the Eurasian heartland. And that's why the British basically provoked Germany into World War I, because Germany was threatening to be this power. And that's why Britain is now afraid of Russia, because Russia is trying to be that power to unify the entire Eurasian heartland. For Dugan to unify the Eurasian heartland, what Moscow needs to do is first of all, create the Berlin Moscow axis to reconcile itself with Europe. It must also create the Moscow Tokyo axis to reach out to Southeast Asia and also to create the Moscow terrain access to control the resources of the Middle East. And by building this alliance, what Moscow is doing is not only restoring the Baizing Empire, but it's also restoring the Pax Mangalaka, the Mongol Empire. So Moscow see itself as the hears to both the Baizing Empire as well as the Mongolian Empire. Now, doing things, this is entirely possible because the Iranians, the Japanese, and the Germans all feel slighted, humiliated by the Anglo-American Empire. So if you give them a choice between sticking with the Anglo-American Empire or joining the new Russian Confederation, where they'll be giving more freedom than they will up for the Russian Confederation. So that's the grand plan. Now, obviously the Anglo-American Empire is gonna oppose this plan. And so for Dugan, what's important is to create internal chaos and dissent and conflict within America and within Britain to destroy the Anglo-American Empire. And that's already happening right now because you have Brexit in Britain and now you have this mass immigration which is threatening the British identity. In America, you have Donald Trump who is proposing America first. So all is going to plan. This plan also recognizes that both Turkey and China are also enemies to the rise of this Eurasian unification. But as we discussed in the previous video, Turkey itself is not very stable. It's kept together for the political maneuvering of Erdogan. Once he's gone, then all these ethnic tensions, these geopolitical tensions, these economic tensions that exist in Turkey will explode and it will overwhelm Turkey, thus causing it to collapse as a nation state. It will lose its coherence as a nation state. Duke Nisdha worried about China as well. He understands that Russia and China can never be allies because China is too economic dependent on the Anglo-American Empire. Basically the point is, Russia has nothing to offer China. China, it's basically a manufacturing economy which must sell its goods to the Anglo-American Empire. Russia cannot absorb these goods. At the same time, there are a lot of internal contradictions in China. I'm gonna tell you, as someone who lives in China for many, many decades, China is not going to survive an economic catastrophe. It's not going to survive an ecological catastrophe. In fact, its economy is propelling its nation to an ecological catastrophe. China's overpopulated, has very little resources, and it imports one third of its food. It imports most of its oil. these bonded industries, EV, AI, rare minerals, they're all contributing to massive ecological destruction in China. I mean, you can say it's unsustainable, but you can also say these economic policies that destroy the environment, it's really suicidal. So China does not have a very bright future ahead of it. So do not worry about China either. So that is the master plan of Exeter Dugan. And again, it is based on the Orthodox Exotology, which perceives Moscow as a third Rome and perceives Latin and Putin as a last, as this great unifier of the world. In Dugan's terms, Putin is the catacombs. Catacombe is Greek word meaning the force that restrains the antichrist. Okay, so for Dugan, Moscow has responsibility to be the force for civilization, for good, for God. Okay, now let's move on to the last eschatological tradition, which is the Catholic eschatology. Now it's interesting because if you read Augustine and the city of God, what he argues is that the church is the millennium. The church is the embodiment of the messianic age. So when they come to the church, the world has ended because the church is able to step out of history and ensure peace, truth, and justice in the world. And that very much is still the official Catholic Church line. There are esoteric elements to the Catholic Church. For example, Catholics do believe that there will be a Second Coming of Jesus and there will be some certain signs that precede the Second Coming of Jesus, which include the masculine version of Jews, which include the age of tribulation, which include the coming of the endocrine. But for the most part, the Catholic Church is committed to a policy of personal eschatology, which argues that it is for our own personal transformation, our own personal salvation redemption through the guidance of the Church that allows for a better world. This is the official line, but we can be suspicious that this is actually what they really believe. I'm sure that there are certain elements within the Catholic Church who do have an eschatological worldview. And there are three reasons why I would think the church, many elements in a church, want radical global transformation. So let's look at these three reasons. First of all, we have to remember the origins of the Catholic Church. It started out as a secret conspiracy against the Roman Empire and it succeeded. Okay? So the Catholic Church is very good at conspiracies. In fact, it really developed the world's first intelligence agency, first global intelligence agency. There are certain elements within the Catholic Church, the Jesuits, Opus Dei, which are famous for their effectiveness, their organization, their strategy. Okay? So, that's the first thing we have to remember about the Catholic Church. They are very good at conspiracies. In fact, they're so good. We didn't even talk about their conspiracies. So if you go online on Twitter, on social media, everyone's talking about the deep state. Everyone's talking about the Jews. about the state of London. But no one's talking about the Catholic Church. That's really weird. You have books and books and books of all of how Jews have influenced history, but very few books on how the Catholic Church influenced history. I would think that the most powerful, wealthiest, and most secretive organization human history for the past 2000 years they would have a much greater impact on human history than the Jews. Okay, so the second thing to remember about the Catholic Church is before the Anglo-American Empire they were the empire. Okay, they had they had a thousand years from the fall of Rome until the rise of the British Empire when they were in charge, when they were the defect of power, in the world. And for many, they believed that was the Messianic Age. That was the millennium. That was the most perfect age, most golden age in human history. And we screwed it up. We threw it away with the rise of the British Empire. And therefore, we must return to that golden age when the Catholic Church was the dominant empire in the world. And the third thing to remember about the Catholic Church is they really are the most powerful non-state organization in the whole world. They have a global network, they have 1 billion followers. If there is a global catastrophe, they are the most ready to to rebuild the world after it collapses. So these are major advantages for the Catholic Church and that's why I think that there are many elements within the Catholic Church who do have an eschatological worldview. They have a plan to conquer the world and they are slowly implemented. Okay? So having said that, let's go over the major opposition, the opponents of the Catholic Church. Well, the first major opponent of course is the Anglo-American Empire. And the Anglo-American Empire represents, of course, enlightenment principles, neoliberalism, materialism, capitalism, Protestantism. And remember, the Protestants and Catholics hate each other. These are the two greatest rivals in human history. Their wars have caused millions of lives. So that's the first major opponent to the Catholic church must destroy, the Anglo-American Empire. Second opponent is the nation state. So in Augustine's formulation, the church is outside of history. It is above history. It controls history. But with the French Revolution, the idea of a nation state came into being. And the idea of a nation state is that it is above church. And that's why in France there are such an emphasis on separation of church and state. So obviously the Catholic Church wants to reverse this order. And in order to reverse this order, it really has to destroy the concept of the nation state. Okay, and the third major opponent is really modernity itself. The cult of the individual which celebrates materialism, hedonism, pleasure. multiculturalism. So the church needs to destroy all three forces if it is to resume the millennium. And we can suspect that there's already a plan in place. And the Catholic Church sends a very good chance of achieving its esotology. So let's look at the three signs that the Catholic Church has a plan in motion. Well, the current vice president of the United States, JD Vance, he has a recent Catholic convert. The new pope is an American. I don't think these are coincidences. I think this is all part of a larger plan. We also remember that the Catholic Church is embedded into the institution of power in the United States. United States. So six of the nine Supreme Court justices are Catholic. Also, the CIA was founded with the help of the Vatican. So William Dunlman, who was the founder of the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, he was a Catholic who was very good friends with the Pope. Also, when the CIA came into being, it had a mandate to fight communism around the world. The The problem is, the problem was that at that time the CIA didn't have a global network. The Vatican did have a global intelligence network and so the CIA and the Vatican formed a holy alliance against communism. And there have been so many CIA directors who are Catholic that the CIA has been nicknamed Catholics in Action or the Catholic Intelligence Agency. So the Vatican and the CIA are very, very close. Another sign is that the Catholic religion is going very, very fast in America. Right now it's about 22% of the American population. But all those immigrants that are coming to America, half of them are Catholic. And these are the illegal immigrants. We're not counting the illegal immigrants who are majority Catholic. also remember Catholics have more children than Protestant families. So the demographic trend looks very good for the Catholic faith. But we can also argue that if there is an American Civil War, a Second Civil War, and the institutions of authority are destroyed, the American Catholics are in the best position to capture the American state. And if they were to capture the American state, then they would control the world. Okay, so I think there are some fanatics within the Catholic Church who want to initiate a second American Civil War, because they believe that this war will create the opportunity for the Catholic Church to control America and and thus destroy all three of its major opponents, the Anglo-American Empire, the nation state, and modernity itself. Okay, so having looked at the major eschatological traditions, I'm gonna discuss where they converge. And what's really interesting is, there's actually quite a few convergence points that are very important. The first convergence point is that there'll be a major conflict in the Middle East that will suck in the whole world. It'll be World War III, okay? Second convergence point is that America will not be involved in this war. And that's very interesting because America is right now the global hegemon. So why America isn't involved in this war? We don't know. It could be because they launched a graduation of Iran, it failed and they were forced to retreat. It could be the civil war going on in America, okay? But America is not involved in this war. The third convergence point is that China is not involved in this war either. And I suspect that it's because China is facing an ecological catastrophe. It doesn't have enough water, it doesn't have enough food, it doesn't have enough resources for its people and you have internal dissent throughout the nation. China is having a hard time keeping itself together. The fourth convergence point is that the antichrist will emerge. And different traditions understand the antichrist differently. But they all believe that this powerful force will emerge who is charismatic and who will unify the world. Another convergence point is that Israel becomes the dominant power in the Middle East, presumably after America leaves the Middle East. And we can understand why, because America leaves the Middle East, then all of America's military infrastructure, Sankom, will merge with the greater Israel project, thus creating the Israel empire. Another convergence point is that anti-Semitism will grow around the world, compelling Jews to return to Israel. Another convergence point is that the Dome of the Rock will be destroyed and thus provoking the Muslim world to take arms against Israel and possibly initiating the war of Gog and Magog. Another convergence point is the age of tribulation when the world will face economic, ecological, geopolitical, catastrophe, after catastrophe, after catastrophe. When people's faith will be tested, when the Antichrist will emerge to deceive people into believing false prophecies, into believing magic, into believing superstitions, into denying the authority of God and of the church. So these are the major convergence points. So now let's go on to question number three. Based on these convergence points, what can we predict about the future? So based on all this, I'm going to paint you a picture of the future and what it looks like. And some of these will not work out, some of these will work out. But it's an interesting framework for us to think about how geopolitics might develop over the next 10 to 20 years. So the United States launched the ground invasion of Iran. Iran is supported heavily by Russia. The United States after a few years of fighting, they give up and they retreat. And so the American Empire retreats back into the Western continent. But this triggers a civil war in America. In Ukraine, NATO decides Odessa will be the last step. So Russia encircles Odessa and lays siege to it. All of NATO is brought in to defend Odessa. This is the very last step. And France, Britain, Romania, Poland, all the NATO countries are brought in, Turkey is brought in as well. And it's a stalemate. This war is going nowhere. But the Europeans don't understand why they're fighting this war. The European people revolt. And this causes civil war in France, in Britain. It causes a political upheaval in Germany. It causes a political revolution in Turkey. And after these civil wars and these revolutions, Europe becomes more pro-Russian, allowing for reconciliation between Putin and Europe. Turkey has destroyed this process. Putin allows the Greeks to return to Constantinople, restoring the Byzantine Empire, and thus unifying the Orthodox world. After the United States leaves the Middle East, the Greater Israel Project becomes the Empire of Israel. The Empire of Israel, in order to restore the Davidic Kingdom in the little Ashen, the Messaging Age, they destroy the Dome of the Rock to build the Third Temple. This causes and its emphasis on symbolism to explode throughout the world. that's compelling Jews to return to Israel. The entire Islamic world wants vengeance against Israel. But their leadership, their political elite have been co-opted and compromised by the Anglo-American Empire and by the Israeli Empire. And so this forces revolutions and civil conflict around the Islamic world. And now people are begging for the Magdi to return. The Magdi is their world unifier. At this point, there are certain elements within the Islamic world who see Putin as the great savior. And in the Islamic eschatology, the name for Putin is Dao Khanan, which is the same concept as the Orthodox idea of the catacombs, the one who stops the Antichrist from emerging. And so, Putin will initiate reconciliation between the Islamic world and the Orthodox world. It'll be an alliance between the Orthodox and the Islamic world. And at this point, Putin can now seek reconciliation between the Islamic Empire, sorry, the Islamic world, and this really empire. You can also seek reconciliation between the Orthodox world and the Catholic world, and thus unifying the world under him, okay? So this is the framework of the world for the next 10, 20 years. Now, do I think this will actually happen? Do I actually think that Putin will replace the Anglo-American empire? He thinks he will succeed, but I think he will succeed. And the reason why is because he's human. And once he dies, then civil conflict will rise within this grand alliance. And this civil conflict will lead to catastrophe, after catastrophe, after catastrophe. It will be the age of tribulation. Many, many people will die in this age of tribulation. So the outlook for humanity is not that great. And this is no different from what happened in about 650, 600 common era, when Muhammad was this great charismatic figure who was supposed to unite the entire world. And he would have if he lived another 10 years. Unfortunately, he died. And this created a civil conflict within the Muslim world. Okay, so those are my predictions. Okay, and again, the thesis, the grand idea is Eschatology drives geopolitics. So if things happen the way they do, then it's because of eschatology. And that gives us proof, compelling proof that it's really eschatology that drives geopolitics. So we'll see what happens next 10, 20 years. Now, having said all this, I have to say it's not, I mean it's not secret what I'm saying. It's not a great secret I've uncovered. I mean, if you read actually in a Dugan, he lays out this plan coherently in his interviews and in his books. So then the question then is, given that this is public domain knowledge, why doesn't the Anglo-American Empire respond strategically to this? Why doesn't the Anglo-American Empire have countermeasures and counterstrategies? why isn't the Anglo-American Empire intent on its own self-preservation? And the answer is, because the people who control the Anglo-American Empire today don't care, because to be dead in 10, 20, 30 years' time, all they wanna do until they die is enjoy their life. And they don't care what will happen to the world after their death. These people, of course, are called baby boomers. They're the ones who control all the political power, the financial power, the influential power in America, the cultural power in America and in the West today. And that's why the West is dying, okay? So I'm gonna talk about this topic in my next video. So I look forward to seeing everyone then. If you're interested, please join my Discord server. I'm gonna put the link below. If you're the means, please support my work by donating to me on Buy Me a Coffee. I really appreciate all the donations. It's real validation of my work.

Professor Jiang here coming to you from a beautiful Toronto morning so Two big news to report the first big news is that Just chatter now that the Israelis will resume airstrikes against Iran Very very shortly and this comes after that in Yahoo's visit to Washington last week where he presumably received permission to do so from the Trump administration. Second big news is that NATO will resume weapons shipments to Ukraine. Trump has given Putin a 50 day ultimatum to end this war in Ukraine, or else Trump will be really, really angry at him. I understand that there are many who are disappointed that Trump has not been able to end this war in Ukraine in one day. As you promised during the campaign. But if you've been an avid follower of this channel, then you will know that this was entirely expected. We can only expect this war in Ukraine to expand. We can only expect the Middle East conflict to escalate. So today I wanna focus on the war in Ukraine. I wanna talk about Putin specifically. From a game theory perspective, this war in Ukraine is very strange because American strategy, American policy, American tactics, they've all been self-defeating. I'll give you three examples. The first example is how aggressive Ukrainian strategy a military doctrine has been. is American Sections against Russia. And the third example is the blowing up of the Nord Stream Pipeline. All three of these policies happen to stop and stop the feeding. So to understand why, we're gonna use kind of factual, we're gonna use game theory kind of factual and compare it to what actually happened. So let's start with Ukrainian military strategy against Russia. The counterfactual is that America chose not to intervene. NATO is not involved and the Ukrainians are left to fight the Russians by themselves. Well, in this situation, the Russians are very quickly, in about three to six months, They're able to bow those their way throughout eastern Ukraine. And in about six months time, they're able to encircle Odessa. And if they capture Odessa, then the entire eastern Ukraine region is now under Russian control. The problem though is that the Russians are overextended. And what Russians are not very good at is organization and logistics and planning. And so what the Ukrainians are able to do is they're able to launch probing attacks against Russian front lines that are very effective. They're also able to employ hidden run guerrilla tactics behind the lines to disrupt the flow of Russian supplies. And after six months, the Russian soldiers in Ukraine, they're heavily demoralized because they don't have enough to eat. There's really no shaji moving forward. They're kind of stuck where they are. At first, the Russian people were in favor of this war. There's patriotic zeal. But after six months, they sour against this war. And popular opinion turns against Putin. And now it's very hard for Putin to sustain this war. There's no strategy moving forward. The Russian people don't really see the point in this war. The Russian military is heavily overextended in Ukraine. And in this instance, Ukraine will probably win this war. So that's the kind of factual if America did not intervene in this war. What happened in reality is that Ukraine chose to fight for every inch of territory. And because it did that, it played to Russia's ultimate strength, which is defensive artillery warfare. It's the best in the world at that. And because the Ukrainians kept on attacking the Russian military, the Russian military was forced to constantly adapt and to be flexible and to be resilient. So quickly, it quickly learned how to use drone warfare to its advantage. So what we're saying this is that by constantly being on the offensive, by fighting for every inch of territory, the Ukrainian military trained the Russian military on how to be a modern military capable of fighting a modern military campaign, specifically using drone warfare. And the result of this is that Russia now has battlefield dominance. It basically controls most of Eastern Ukraine, the Donbass region. And the Ukrainian military, Because of its relentless aggression against the Russian military, it's really now short on manpower. And the morale in the military is very low. And what's been amazing about this campaign is the Ukrainians haven't really learned battlefield lessons. They really didn't adapt to how the Russians were adapting. And this sort of suggests that the entire military campaign was being run out of Brussels or Washington DC, but it's certainly not being run by the Ukrainians. And because of this, the Ukrainians have really lost the war. So that's the first example of where American strategy in Ukraine has been stuff defeating. Second example are these American sanctions against Russia specifically targeting Russian business people with close ties to the Putin regime which is basically every single business person in Russia. The kind of factual is America does not impose sanctions. Well as this war runs its course the biggest opposition to Putin is the oligarchal elite. These business people who see their trade, their industry suffer because of this war and they start to organize subtle, quiet underground resistance against Putin. Basically they engage in forms of economic sabotage. Putin and the business elite have always had an uneasy relationship. But the fact that the Americans targeted the business elite, 70 other top business people in Russia were hit with sanctions, Then what that did ultimately was unify the business elite around Putin. They didn't have an option. In an ideal world, they would prefer to maintain close relationships with the Western world because that's where they send their wealth and their children and that's where they like to have their second homes. And we know this because of what's happening in China. So there is a trade war between the United States and China. But this is a general trade war that's targeting the Chinese economy. It's not targeting specific individuals in China. And as a result of this, what's happened is that the business elite have unified against Xi Jinping. And this has made governance hard for Xi Jinping. So the example is in an ideal world where Xi Jinping was in control, he would like the military to start invasion plans against Taiwan. But that's not what's happening. It seems as though the Chinese regime, it's in sort of governance deadlock. It can't really govern. We haven't heard that much news from China And there's always these rumors that Xi Jinping is on his way out. Now these rumors are false, they're fabricated, but it shows you that he's not as powerful as people like to believe. So when it comes to China, it seems that American policy has been calculated in a way to achieve long-term American interest. That's not been true in Russia. The sanctions against Putin's regime and the oligarchal interest in Russia has unified the Russian elite. Much more problematic is that the Western financial system has frozen about $300 billion in Russian assets. That's essentially just stealing. And that basically undermines the credibility of the Western financial system and ultimately it undermines the credibility of the US dollar which is a source of American imperial power. And so that's been very self-defeating. The third example I want to look at is the blowing up of the North Stream pipeline. Everybody knows the Americans blew that up. And because it blew it up, it's really caused the German economy, which was dependent on cheap Russian gas. It's caused the economy to crater. So the kind of factual is the Americans didn't do this. The Americans didn't blow up the Nord Stream pipeline. Well, over time, as this war on Ukraine continues, the German people would have been very angry at Russia. in response, there would be political pressure to impose sanctions on Russia. And so the Germans would have stopped buying Russian gas naturally, and they would start buying American oil naturally. But the German economy would have created because of this, but at that point, the German people would have blamed Putin for their economic misery. Instead, by blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline, the German people now all know that they're suffering, they're gonna make misery. It's all because of Americans. Okay, so the blame now rests on the Americans. And this is long-term problematic because there's only one force that can possibly defeat the Anglo-American Empire. And that is an alliance between Germany and Russia. Russia. And that's ultimately what Putin wants. And so by blowing up the North Stream pipeline, America has basically unleashed the structural forces that will culminate in a possible alliance between Germany and Russia. And that would ultimately destroy the Anglo-American hegemony in the world. So these are three examples of American policies that are self-defeating. And again, from a game third perspective, this is strange. And again, when it comes to China, American policy is far more calibrated. It's far more strategic. It's far more able to achieve long-term American interest. So the mystery, the paradox that we're looking at today is why is it that when it comes to Russia, American policy is so self-defeating. It's almost as though Putin has spied and planted within the Western imperial apparatus. It's very, very strange. The second question I want to look at today is where exactly did Putin come from? How is it that this nobody, this man who came from a lower middle class family in St. Petersburg and he was an unknown entity for the first 30 years of his life, how did he suddenly become the most powerful man in Russia? So that's the second big question I want to look at today. And the third big question is where is this all going? What does Putin want? Why did he invade Ukraine? Okay, so those are the three big questions we're looking at today. And I'll be very honest with you, these three questions are unanswerable. Okay, I don't know why, I don't know the answers to any of these three questions and quite honestly, we'll never know because there's not enough information to work with. So what I'm gonna do today is I'm gonna present a hypothesis. And there's gonna be a lot of problems with this hypothesis. But the good thing is that with any hypothesis, there is embedded in it in a prediction model. So I'm going to explain to you the hypothesis, and then from the hypothesis, I'm going to conjecture certain predictions that this hypothesis model entails. And these predictions will tell us if the hypothesis model is correct or not, okay? So that's what we're gonna do today. All right, so let me present to you my hypothesis to the three questions. Why is Putin winning the one Ukraine? Where did he come from? What does he want? Okay, so I'm gonna start off with a couple of biographical details about Putin. And remember, what's really important is we're getting these details from the mouth of Putin himself. So it's possible these details are fabricated, it's possible they're embellished. But let's just look at these two details. The first detail I wanna look at is Putin Tell, told New York Times in the view that his grandfather, Sparadon Putin, was the personal cook to both Vladimir Lenin as well as Joseph Stalin. Okay, that's the first detail I wanna look at. The second detail I'm going to look at is, and again, Putin told this to reporters in an interview. His mother was without Christian who secretly baptized him. And even today he wears the baptismal cross to show his devotion to his mother and to his faith and to his country. So what do these two details tell us? And again, remember what's really important is these two biological details could be completely fabricated. All right, but let's assume that there is truth to these details. Spiridon Putin, Putin's grandfather, was the personal cook to both Lenin and Stalin. Well, what this tells us is that he was a very powerful person because he had access to the most powerful people in Russia. And if you're powerful, then you can start to do favors for the people. You can promote their careers. You can also save their lives. And as a result, a lot of people high up in the Soviet bureaucracy, the nomenclature, They owe a lot of favors to Putin's grandfather. That's the first thing. Second thing is, because he was a personal cook to the most powerful people in the Soviet Union, it meant that he was extremely trusted. He was probably part of the KGB, a very high official within the KGB. And also the KGB was probably spying on him, his family, and all his friends. And they found nothing wrong with this guy. Spurdan Putin died of old age. He died when he was 86, when Putin was 13 years old. And he was never purged. He was never arrested. He was never suspect of anything. So this man clearly was humble. He had no ambitions. And he was selfless. He was dedicated to his leaders, bring good meals for his leaders. And that suggests to me that he was religious. And again, it was very common for Russians of his generation, of his background, to be Orthodox Christian. And so he was probably religious, and he was probably a devout Orthodox Christian. Okay, that's the second thing that we must know about him. And the third thing that I suspect is that He really loved and admired Lenin and Stalin, especially Stalin. Because remember, in World War II, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. It really seemed the end of days. 27 million Soviet citizens died in this war. And for Russia to have won this war, you had to believe that it was divine intervention. And you had to believe that Stalin really was the Messiah. And what's important is Stalin was able to win this war because of his repulsion with the Orthodox Church. Starting with Lenin, there was massive persecution of the Orthodox Church because Lenin, Trotsky, they were all atheists, Marxist intellectuals, who believed that it was Orthodox Christianity that kept Russia feudal, primitive, backward. Stalin is different because Stalin was not a Marxist intellectual. He never went to university, like Lenin and Trotsky. In fact, he was poor. His father was an abusive alcoholic. His mother, though, was a devout Christian, who sent her son to seminary in order to become an Orthodox priest. And so Stalin didn't grow up in the Marxist tradition, he grew up in the Orthodox tradition. And that's probably why he got along much better with the Orthodox Church than he did with these marchers intellectuals whom he ultimately purged and killed. So during World War II Stalin had to engage the people. He had to excite them. And so he relied on the Orthodox Church to stir up these ethnic religious sentiments, these nationalist sentiments, in order to unite the people against the Nazis. And for the Orthodox Church, this really was a holy war. This is a war between the third Rome which is Moscow. In the Orthodox tradition, Moscow is considered a third Rome. The second Rome of course was Constantinople which fell to Ottoman Turks in 1453. And so this war was really the ultimate struggle between true Christian civilization, which is Soviet Union, and the Antichrist, which was Nazi Germany. And the Orthodox Church then had to see Stalin as a messiah, as the chosen one who would lead them to ultimately victory against the Nazis, who would redeem Russian civilization from the evil communism and who would restore the Byzantine Empire. But before Stalin could restore the Byzantine Empire, he died. Some believe that his colleagues who were afraid of him, they poisoned him. But in the Orthodox tradition, that just means that he truly is Messiah. Because remember, Jesus had to die before we could be redeemed. And Jesus had to die before the world could truly believe in him. him. And because he died, there's now a promise that he would eventually return and save the world, the second coming. So after Selen died, we can imagine that there were many people within the Orthodox Church and also within elite Soviet politics that believed that Selen would ultimately return to lead the Russian civilization into ultimate victory against the end of Christ. and he would ultimately restore the Byzantine Empire, which is the destiny of Moscow. So why is this important? It's important because these ideas, Spyrton Putin would tell his grandson, Vladimir Putin. Spyrton Putin would also introduce Putin to to this elite nexus of power within the Orthodox Church and within the Soviet hierarchy so that Putin was well known to powerful people. And ultimately, Spiritan Putin would come to believe that his grandson, it's possible this very precocious young man. It is possible that he could be the second coming of Stalin. Okay? And so this helps us understand and answer the second question, which is how did Putin come into power? And the reason is that it was well known to a secret faction of the Orthodox Church and the KGB. and he was slowly nurtured over time and when the time was appropriate after the fall of the Soviet Union, after basically the increasing unpopularity of the Elson regime they fought now is perfect time to put Putin into power This also helps us explain the third question which is what Putin wants and Putin wants to be the second coming of Stalin He wants to finish the mission that Stalin could not finish, which is the restoration of the Byzantine Empire. And so how will this be accomplished? Well, within the Orthodox eschatological tradition, there's a prophecy, and this prophecy is attributed most famously to a Greek Orthodox monk name Paseos of Mount Anthos. There's controversy as to whether or not he actually said this prophecy, but it's most commonly attributed to him, and that's what the Russian narrative is. And the prophecy goes like this. Russia and Turkey are destined to go to war against each other. Right now, President Artighan of Turkey, he's a very sly political operator. He's able to balance competing factions within his government, but he's also able to compete to, sorry, he's also able to balance competing forces in geopolitics, specifically Russia and NATO. Turkey is a member of NATO, but Turkey remains a close relationship with Russia. But after he passes on the scene, after he falls in power, then the new government will become very pro-NATO. And at that point, Turkey will start aggressive policies against Russia, like for example, closing off the phosphorus and allowing NATO warships to enter the Black Sea, which will force Russia to invade Turkey. Russia will destroy Turkey in amount of days, because remember, Russia is nuclear superpower, And then Russia will hand Turkey Constantinople back to the Greeks. And this will restore the Byzantine Empire. The Hagia Sophia, the main cathedral in Constantinople, which was the seat for many centuries, the seat of the Orthodox world, that will be restored as an Orthodox church. It will be cleansed of its Islamic pollution and this will unify the Orthodox world around Russia and around Putin. That's the prophecy. When I heard about this prophecy online and what I'll do is I'll link YouTube video, describing this prophecy in the description. It's very important that you yourself understand this prophecy. And when I first encountered this prophecy, I thought it was very strange because it didn't really sound like a prophecy. It sounded more like a plan. So I wouldn't be surprised if the truth is that Russian intelligence implanted this prophecy among Orthodox monks, because remember, there's always been a close relationship between Russian intelligence and the Orthodox church. And so, What's the plan? The plan is to cause a war between Russia and Turkey, which will allow Russia to reclaim Constantinople, and then it would unite the Orthodox world. So that's prophecy. So how would this plan come into being? Well, what's interesting is, if you look at the trajectory of the war in Ukraine right now, it seems that this plan, this prophecy will happen naturally. Because the next phase of this war is the Russian's circumvent of Odessa. If Russians are able to take Odessa, Ukraine is finished. Because Russia will be able to control the entire coastline, which allows them to control trade and logistics in the Black Sea. And once Russia controls Eastern Ukraine, the war is over because Eastern Ukraine is the agricultural and industrial heartland of Ukraine. Russian Ukraine will become a welfare state for the European Union, and Putin is very happy to have that happen. This means that NATO will make its last stand in Odessa. Right now, a lot of preparations are being made to reinforce Odessa. And this is great for Putin because once the Russians are having able to encircle Odessa, it becomes a death trap for NATO. NATO will send in a lot of soldiers and they're all just gonna die there. And this is gonna cause a lot of popular resentment back in France, in Britain, in Poland. And this will probably cause a civil war in these nations. Remember these nations are already on the brink of civil war. And what's more important is that eventually Turkey will be brought into this war because it is a NATO ally. And as a result, this gives Putin opportunity to confront Turkey. And again, what's really important for us to understand is that Russia does not have to defeat Turkey on the battlefield. It doesn't even have to defeat France or Britain. Russia has to do is draw this war out and this will become increasingly popular in Turkey, in Britain, in France, which leads to civil discontent, which leads to political chaos, and eventually these nations will collapse and implode economically and politically. And when that happens, Russia will be victorious. And so that's Putin's plan moving forward to make Odessa into the final battle between NATO and Russia, which will culminate in the implosion, the plug-in implosion of Turkey, which will allow for Russia to take over Turkey. In fact, the Turkish people might even invite Putin and the Russians into Turkey, thus fulfilling the prophecy and thus proving that Putin is in fact the Messiah, the second coming of Joseph Stalin. The best evidence for this is again that biographic detail that Putin revealed to journalists, that his mother was about Christian, who baptized Putin secretly. This detail is important because it's a dog whistle to all those Orthodox fanatics and extreme Russian violence out there that in fact Putin and Stalin have a lot of similarities. In fact, they're probably the same person because remember, Stalin himself, his mother was a Christian who sent him to seminary school. So that explains the second idea that helps us answer the second question which is what does Putin want? Putin wants to restore the Bosnian Empire. He wants to unify the Orthodox world and he wants to retake Constantinople from the Turks. And this war in Ukraine is the perfect platform, is the perfect mechanism for him to achieve ambitions. And this leads us to the first question, which is how is Putin able to do all this? How is Putin able to be able to control history like this? Frederick Hegel would call Putin the world historical figure and Frederick Nietzsche would call Putin the uberman, the Superman, the uberman, the man who was able to step outside of history to control history and achieve his book ambitions and by doing so forever change the course of human history. How is he the uberman? Okay so to answer this question and again I don't know the answer okay so here I'm only speculating to answer this question what's really important for us to understand is the conflict between the Orthodox Christian world and Western civilization. For Orthodox Christians they really see Western civilization as a manifestation of the Antichrist because Western civilization the three pillars of Western civilization are capitalism, science and liberalism. Liberalism is the cult of the individual, the belief in hiddenism, the belief that the pursuit of individual pleasure is what matters most in life. Science is the rejection of God and the worship of the material world. Capitalism is pure greed, pure selfishness. So for Orthodox Christians, Westernization means rejection of God, of faith, of tradition, which is what the Orthodox tradition represents. And so for Orthodox Christians, this is a war civilization, a struggle of civilizations, and only one can survive. Only the Western viewpoint can survive or the Orthodox viewpoint can survive. And Orthodox Christians are determined to win this war because if they don't win this war, then the world is hopeless. The world is pointless. And Putin himself has said this in a speech. So, it seems as though Western civilization is much more powerful than Orthodox civilization. Western civilization, Western Europe, America, it's much more advanced economically, scientifically, technologically. It has a greater population. It has more resources. It has more wealth. But the Orthodox Christians believe that God is with them. God communicates with them and God is planning on the destruction of the Western civilization. And the Orthodox Christians are only the tool of God to achieve this. If you look at current events, then there's a lot of justification for this. But let me explain this in a different way, okay? So I believe, and a lot of people believe that there is an underlying consciousness to the universe. Hegel calls this the Geist, Carl Jung calls this the collective unconscious. Because we have thoughts, right? Well, the question then is, Where do our thoughts come from and where do they go? So let's assume that there is a collective unconscious to the universe and we can call this force God. Well, that's a case. Then we're able to communicate with this collective unconscious. As long as you believe it exists, as long as you make the effort to embrace this collective unconscious, as long as you have faith in God. The problem with Western civilization is it denies the existence of God, it denies the existence of this collective unconscious because of its embrace of materialism. And as a result, it's lost its connection with this collective unconscious. But because the Orthodox tradition, it's much more mystical. It's focused much more on miracles. It's much more focused on faith. Then there are certain mystics within the Orthodox tradition or capable of communicating with this collective unconscious. And if you're capable of communicating with this collective unconscious, then you're also capable of influencing it in a certain way that allows you to achieve outcomes that you desire. Okay, and this helps us understand how Putin is able to control the battlefield in Ukraine, how he's able to manipulate the Americans into policies that are self-defeating. And it ultimately gives us a sense that Putin will actually ultimately win out in the end because he could be the Ubers months. Okay, so that's the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that during the time of Stalin, a secret nexus of power between the Orthodox Church and the KGB came into being and they were determined to achieve the third Rome prophecy and restore the Byzantine Empire. They thought that Stalin could help them achieve this, but after his death, they had to await the second coming of Stalin. And so they were looking for possible candidates. Finally, they settled on Putin and they elevated him into supreme power. They supported him ever since. And now with this war in Ukraine, they see the perfect opportunity to destroy Western civilization and we create the third role and we store the Byzantine Empire. Okay, that's the plan. That's the hypothesis. Now with this hypothesis, we can make three predictions based on this hypothesis that will tell us if this hypothesis is correct or not. So the first prediction of course is the war in Ukraine will shift to Odessa. That's where the final battle between NATO and Russia will take place. Turkey will be brought into this war. Once Turkey enters this war, it will become extremely unpopular within Turkey, which will lead to the implosion of the Turkish government and a revolution, which will allow Russia to come in easily to control Turkey, okay? So Odessa is a first big prediction. The second big prediction is there'll be a falling out between China and Russia. Because if this hypothesis is correct, and Russia is fighting a war for civilization, for the soul of humanity, it's fighting a war for God, then the true enemy is Western civilization, but it's also China. Because China is even more of a godless, valueless, materialistic society than Western civilization. At the very least, the United States, Britain, France, they profess to be Christian. But China, it is decidedly communist, atheist, and it's proudly so. So Russia has contempt for China and ultimately sees China as an enemy. Eventually they'll be falling out. Okay, and we'll see this happen very quickly. And the third prediction is that Russia will defend Iran. it cannot afford for Iran to fall. Not only for geopolitical reasons, but because in this cosmology, in this war between Russian civilization and Russian civilization, Iran is an important ally for Russian civilization, because they're both, both Russia and Iran are fighting to bring God back to humanity. Okay, so those are the three big predictions if they, of all three predictions happened, where the war in Ukraine shifts to this final chalice-making struggle in Odessa, where Russia and China are falling out, and where Russia comes to the aid of Iran, then we will have strong evidence that my hypothesis is correct. And in fact, Putin does see himself as a second coming of Stalin. Okay, so that's it. What I will do in my next video is connect all the desperate pieces together and try to predict what will happen around the world in the next five to 10 years. Quick announcement, I'm taking a break next week. I'm taking my kids camping. It's something that we've been planning for a long time. So unfortunately I won't be able to do a video next week but I will be back the week after. Also, tomorrow from eight to 10 p.m. each instead of time, I'll be doing a Discord livestream where I will, what I can help you elaborate or explain certain issues that you've been struggling with over the course of these videos. One last announcement is, last week I announced that I have a Buy Me a Coffee account and the support has been overwhelming. So thank you so much for supporting my work. It's really helpful. But again, don't feel any pressure to support me. If you have the means, please do so. It's really helpful, I really appreciate it. but don't feel any pressure to do so. I see my mission as trying to educate as many people as possible. I'm trying to help you understand the world and I understand that many of you might be confused or they might disagree with what I'm saying, but what's really important is this is a learning process and we're both trying to develop theories and hypotheses and analytical models to better understand the world. So it's a process. And there are a lot of things in which I'm going to be wrong. But what's really important is there are predictions in place. And if these predictions happen, then that's good reason to think that the analytical model I'm proposing is correct. They don't happen, then we'll just go back and change the analytical model. So this is a process in which we're all trying to learn together. So that's it. Thank you for listening to this video and I will see everyone next time."}

Today we are doing Jesus, the most famous man who has ever lived. There are about two billion people on this planet, about a quarter of the human race who worshiped him. So who is he? What does he believe? And why is he so important? Okay, so let's look at first what we know about the historical Jesus. There was a man who lived, and these are facts that scholars, most scholars, agree about him. He was born in the year 4 BC in a place called Galilee. And this is important because Galilee, it is in Judea, Israel today. And Galilee is a meeting place of many different cultures, religions, and beliefs. This is part of the Roman Empire, and this is really the center of much of the world at that time. And then he was a student of someone called John the Baptist. John the Baptist is a major Jewish religious leader who believed in baptism as a way of cleansing you of your sins so that you may prepare for the kingdom of heaven. God is coming, but you must first cleanse your sins and restart yourself in order to be worthy of his arrival. But then after some time with John the Baptist, Jesus started to create his own following And Jesus was preaching his own message that was very attractive. And he developed a very large following. He was pretty well known for his healing powers. So if you were sick, he could heal you through the power of faith and belief. Then what we also know is about the year 30 to 33 CE. So it was like when it was like 34, 37. He was crucified by the Romans, okay, crucifixion. We don't know why they crucified him, but we believe he was crucified. And crucifixion was the worst way to die. And the crucifixion was basically reserved only for two types of people. Either bandits, pirates, or rebels, rebels, people who defied the Roman state. And it was really reserved for poor, illiterate individuals who had no status. Because crucification, you may not know this, but when they crucify you, they nail you to a cross and they put you up, okay? You don't die because of bleeding or because of pain. You die because of suffocation. You suffocate to death. So what happens, you're on the cross And eventually, you start to lose power and you start to, you can't even hold up your neck, okay? So you're suffocating to death because you can't breathe. It takes about three days to die. So it's really the worst way to die, okay? And that's what happened to Jesus. And historically, this is all that we know about him, okay? This is what's been confirmed by scholars, by archaeologists, by researchers. Jesus is the most studied individual in human history. No one comes close. But we really don't know much about him, okay? All right, so now that we've looked at the historical Jesus, let's look at the biblical Jesus because these are two very different individuals. So Jesus in the Bible is the son of God, okay? The son of God. And he's in heaven enjoying his life, but he sees the world underneath him And he pities us. And he wants to liberate us from our pain and our suffering. He wants to redeem us and to atone for our sins and our crimes. And he's born of a virgin mother named Mary. And from a very early age, he is a religious genius who attracts followers to him. And he has 12 apostles. 12 apostles. And he's determined to preach the coming of the kingdom of heaven. Okay? God is coming and we must be ready for him. He also preaches a religion of forgiveness and redemption and compassion and generosity and mercy. So he will say things like, do not judge others. Let those who are without fault, without sin, without mistakes, be the first to cast the stone. So we shouldn't judge others because we all have our own faults. We should be generous and open and compassionate to others. So he was preaching that message. He was also, in many ways, a social revolutionary because he was upset with the religion of the times. At that time, the Jewish religion was controlled very much by the priesthood. So you show your faith by making animal sacrifices, by basically paying a tribute to God. And Jesus thought that was wrong. You show your faith by being a good person, by being generous, by refusing materialism and greed and corruption. You don't show your faith through animal sacrifice. And as such, he angered the religious powers at that time, especially the priests of the temple in Jerusalem. So eventually, he was betrayed by his apostle named Judas Iscariot. Judas Iscariot reported the crimes of Jesus to the religious powers. and in turn, the religious powers, the priests of the temple, turned them over to the Roman governor of that time. Okay, his name is Pontius Pilate. Pontius Pilate. And Pontius Pilate really didn't want to be involved. He didn't know what crime Jesus committed, but the priests insisted, the Jewish people insisted, and so as a sacrifice, Pontius Pilate agreed to crucify Jesus. So Jesus was crucified and after he was crucified and he died, he was resurrected. How do we know? Because he appeared before his apostles and told him, look, I've come to this earth in order to redeem and atone for the sins of men. I have now done so. Therefore, God will come and cleanse the earth of all sin. my message, spread my gospel. Gospel is Greek for good news and I will return to you okay. So there's a promise that there'll be a second coming and when Jesus returns he will come as prophesies on top of clouds and he will spite all of God's enemies and they will build a paradise. So that's That's what the Bible says. And by the way, what's really important for us to understand is there are contradictions in the Bible. Because although we know about Jesus comes from four biographies in the Bible, OK, the gospels, the good news. And they're written by four different individuals, who we name Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. And again, there are inconsistencies within their biographies. But if you put them together, this is a story of Jesus. Now, when you hear the story, there's certain problems with the story. The biggest story is, sorry, the biggest problem is if he is, in fact, the son of God, if he is divine, how to explain the crucifixion and the resurrection? Why does the Son of God have to die? And how does a son of God die? And this is one of the most perplexing and confusing questions in Christianity. And it's been with us for about 2,000 years. So no one's really resolved this issue. But the standard explanation is this. Why did Jesus have to come to earth? The reason why is God and the children He created us are at war. There's a religious war going on. God created us and put us in the garden of Eden out of Medivh. And God told us, listen, this is paradise, you can do whatever you want. But there's only one rule you must not break. Do not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. That's all we have to do. Don't eat that fruit, but we disobey them. And God in his anger exiled us from paradise. And in our stupidity, in our ignorance, in our selfishness, we never came to recognize our own original sin, our own failings. And so we continue to make more and more mistakes, which has led to a more corrupt and decadent world. God up in heaven is waiting for us to ask for forgiveness, to omit our mistakes. And we refuse to do so because we're kids, we're stupid. But God, even though he's merciful, even though he is wise, must be asked for forgiveness before he can forgive us. Okay? And Jesus, who is the Son of God, he recognizes this conflict. He recognizes this in-pass. And he decides he will come to earth and he will sacrifice himself in order to atone for the sins of man and release us from our own supine or ignorance and allow God to forgive us. But if you think about it, this is all the work of God because God is allowing us to forgive ourselves. And in many ways, what this is doing is solving the problem of Achilles. Remember, we talked about the Iliad, right? And in the Iliad, there's a central conflict in the Iliad, and it's a problem of Achilles. Remember that Achilles is this great warrior who refuses to fight for the Greeks because Agamemnon, the king, has insulted him. But he really wants to fight. Eventually in his arrogance, he causes the death of his friend, Patroclus. And when Patroclus dies, it makes Achilles even more angry at himself. And that's why he takes out his anger on Hector. He doesn't recognize his own feelings. He doesn't recognize his own sin. And it took Prim to release him from his anger. Remember, Prim forgave Achilles. And when Prim forgave Achilles, it released Achilles from his own guilt. The problem, though, is if Prim never forgave Achilles, then Achilles would have been stuck in his depression and his anger. So this is Achilles' problem. If we can't forgive ourselves, who will forgive us? And the answer of course is Jesus will forgive you. And this is the fundamental idea of Christianity. Do not be angry at yourself, do not hate yourself, do not feel guilty because Jesus has forgiven you, which allows you to be a new you. You can not be whoever you want because Jesus has to tone you or take away your sins and your guilt. If you believe in him, then you will become a new person. You can become whoever you want to be. So this is the idea of Christianity. Jesus made the sacrifice in order to release us from our own guilt and our own shame so we can be free to worship God in His glory. Any questions? Not only that, but because of the sacrifice of Jesus, Everyone is now free to worship God. Because before, remember, God was a religion within Judaism. Only Jews had access to God. And even within the religion itself, really only the high priests had access to God. So Jesus came to earth to tell us all humans, the entire human race, God is within all of us. You don't have to be a Jewish person to believe in God. you can just be a person who wants to believe in God. And this is an idea that is beautifully encapsulated in the Gospel of Mark. So let's read the section together. And this is when Jesus has been crucified and he has died. Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last. So the Son of God has died. He's completed his mission. And the curtain of the temple was torn into from top to bottom. This is an extremely important sentence. The curtain is the door inside the temple. The curtain is what protects the inner sanctum, the holiest room. It's called the holy of the holies, okay? From everyone else. When the high priest can enter there, Why? Because that room is where God is. Okay? So when the curtain is torn in two, what this is telling us is God is now released into the world. God was trapped inside the temple, but now that the curtain has been torn in two, because of the sacrifice of Jesus, God can now enter the world and we can all have access to him. He's no longer trapped inside this curtain. Okay? Does that make sense? And when the Sartorian, the Sartorian is the Roman, not the Jewish person, who stood facing him, okay, so the Sartorian was watching guard to make sure no one came to save Jesus, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, truly this man was God's son. So the first person to recognize who Jesus really is are not his apostles, but a Roman who saw him die. So this centurion is history's first Christian because he sees himself, this man, this Jesus, was truly the Son of God, a divine figure who came to earth in order to liberate us from our sins and to build a connection between us and God. Okay? So this is the very basis of the Christian faith. You believe that Jesus came to earth in order to atone for our sins and to liberate us from the corruption of religion and the world around us. Does this make sense, guys? Any questions so far, if I continue? So while this is a beautiful story and it's touched people for a thousand years and millions of people, it really doesn't make much sense. There are problems within the story. The biggest problem is the idea of atonement and original sin. Remember, before we said to the Bible, we studied the story of Adam and Eve. And we said very clearly what the Bible says is, both God, Yahweh, and Adam and Eve were at fault. Adam and Eve did disobey God and did eat from the tree, But God lied to them. And God, we also said, recognized his mistake. Also, remember, God already punished us for disobedience. God said to Adam, from now on, you have to work hard to grow food for your family. And he said to Eve, from now on, you will suffer pain in your labor. When you give birth, you will suffer immense pain. So God has already punished us for our original sin. Then the last problem is God kicked us out of paradise because he feared that we would eat from the tree of life which would give us eternal life. So this idea of original sin, and I told you doesn't make any sense. Also, why is God angry at us? If he's God, if he's perfection, why does he have to be angry at us? What do we do to piss him off? Would a father be angry at his children always? Is it the responsibility of the children to ask for forgiveness, or the responsibility of the father to forgive his children? Okay? So this is an extremely problematic story. It sounds beautiful, when you start to think about it, it becomes extremely problematic. Also, there are things in the story that are not historically accurate. So the biggest problem is this. The Bible says very explicitly at times that it was the Jews who killed Jesus. And this is problematic because this has been used to justify anti-Semitic behavior and language throughout the centuries. Okay? But historically, this is not what happened. All right? So let me give you a few reasons why I do not believe this is what happened. The first reason is what the Bible does not recognize is at this time in Jerusalem there are many different religious authorities among the Jewish people and there are conflict with each other. three major factions are called the Seducis, the Sadduces, the Pharisees, and the Essenes. OK? These are three major factions. The Seducis are the aristocrats. The little priests who are in charge of the temple. They're basically the central authority of the religion. But then you have the Pharisees who argue that what matters is not animal sacrifice, but obedience to the law of God. Okay? And these are reformers. And eventually from them, we emerge what we call the rabbis, basically the current leaders of the Jewish faith. And then you have the scenes who believe that there is an apocalypse coming, God is returning to earth. And what's important is to deny the material reality, to live frugally, to live in peace, to live in harmony, to gather. And guess what, guys? These three groups hate each other. They were always at conflict with each other. But they never went to war with each other, because they believed that they were all God's people. Therefore, we should argue we should not kill each other. So the idea that these priests would send Jesus to his death doesn't really fit into the culture and the practice of people at that time. Okay? That's the first problem. Second problem is the Bible makes Pontius Pilate look to be a... The Bible makes Pontius Pilate look to be very reluctant. And even at times, sympathetic towards Jesus. It's a very pro-Roman attitude. But we have a lot of information about Pardes Pilate, the governor of Judea at this time. What we know about him is he was a violent thug, like most Roman Romans. The Romans have an atorist attitude of being violent first. They're not very political. They're not very strategic. they like to kill people, okay? And at this time, Pond's pilot had a major conflict with the Jews of Jerusalem. The first law of the Ten Commandments is, you shall not worship false idols. But Pond's pilot represented the Roman Empire, and their false idol was their emperor. So the emperor, the face of the emperor Tiberius who was in coins, and there were flags and posters around him. And the Pontus Pilate wanted to bring the coat of Caesar to Jerusalem, which offended the Jews, because the Jews are not allowed to have false idols inside their city, the holy city. And there's quite a lot of conflicts between Pontus Pilate and the Jews. There were some circumstances where the Jews went to Pontus Pilate to complain. And the Pontus Pilate says, if you don't get out of my house, I'm going to kill all of you. And the Jew starts to line up and says, come. Here's what you got. Come kill me, OK? And so Pontus Pilate had to relent. He had no faith. The Jews were all going to die to protect their religion. So Pontus Pilate was not a very political, not a very savvy individual. He continued to offend the Jews. So the idea that Pontus Pilate would be sympathetic towards Jesus. makes no sense. If the pilot could kill you, he would kill you. Any questions so far? Okay. So I'm going to make an argument. I'm going to explain to you that the Bible, what it says, isn't really accurate. We construct the historical Jesus, and I'm going to tell you based on my reading of the history and of the Bible what he really believed. And just to be clear, I'm not a scholar. I really haven't studied the Bible that much. Okay? All I've done is a lot of independent research. So take my words, we're going to solve, okay? And feel free to challenge me or question my argument at any time. Just raise your hand. All right. So, before I talk about Jesus, I want to talk about the historical circumstance of of Jerusalem and Judea at this time. So let's do a brief summary of what we've learned so far. We've learned that King David was the founder of the religion, one of the main founders of the religion. And at this time in history, in about 1,000 BCE, this is really the height and peak of the state of Israel. And they're very confident, very open, very generous. But after David dies, his son Solomon is not able to keep the kingdom together. And it splits into two, the northern kingdom and Judah. Over time, because Israel is in such a strategic location, the Levant is the center of the world, both of these places will be conquered by foreigners. The northern kingdom will be conquered by the Assyrians. Judah will be conquered by the Babylonians. And the elite are set off into exile in Babylon, where they basically develop the religion of Judaism, of its modern form. The Persians return the Jews back to Judea, Israel, and there they write the Bible. And this comes out 444. But then the Persians are conquered by the Greeks. by Alexander the Great in 301. And now Ptolemy, the Greek general, is in charge of the area. And Ptolemy is in charge of Egypt. And Egypt is very wealthy. So Ptolemy prefers to use money to resolve disputes. So what he does is basically say to the Jewish elite, the priests, hey, your religion is really interesting. When do you guys come to Alexandria, the capital of Egypt and translate your Hebrew Bible into the Greek Bible so that we can all appreciate the beauty and power of your words. And we call this Bible the Septetuant. And it's very important. You don't have to know this word, but remember this is the Greek Bible. It becomes the basis of Christianity. Because most people, by the time Christianity comes, won't read Hebrew, they'll be able to read Greek. But then in 167 BCE, Jerusalem is conquered by the solution empire, Antiochus. And Antiochus is a thought. So he comes and he desecrates a temple by offering a sacrifice to Zeus, a pig sacrifice to Zeus in their temple. And this offends the Jews so much they launch a decades-long guerrilla warfare against the solution empire. In 63 BCE, the Romans conquer Jerusalem. Pompey, the great, the Roman general, comes and conquers Laceach to Jerusalem. He kills tens of thousands of Jews and enslaves others and sent them across the empire. So at this point in history, and Jesus is born a few decades later at 4 BCE, the Jews have become extremely fanatical about the religion. They need to explain if they are the chosen people. If God, Yahweh is the best God in the world, why is this crap happening? Why did their kingdom become dissolved and then conquered by foreigners? And not only that, but these foreign powers, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, they come and they insult their God. They burn down the temple. They desegrate the temple, and they kill a lot of God's chosen people. So why is this happening? And the explanation, there's a twofold explanation. The first explanation is we were not loyal enough to God. God sent these foreigners to conquer us because we disobey God. We worship foreign idols and we refuse to follow God's commandments. Okay, that's the first explanation. The second explanation is the idea of apocalyptic eschatology. Sorry, apocalyptic eschatology. This is a very big term, and I need you guys to know it, because it's important for future classes. So let's look at what this means. Eschatology comes from the Greek eschatod, which means the end. The end, end of the world, end times. Apocalypse is Greek for revelation or unveiling, okay? Revealing. So apocalyptic eschatology means telling you how the world ends with the return of God, okay? So all this crap is happening is God is planning to make his return to smite all his enemies, to destroy all these empires who have defiled his name. All right? And this is what most Jews believed at this time of Jesus. When Jesus was born, it was assumed that God was about to return to the world and destroy all his enemies. And there were a lot of prophets running around preaching this message. Jesus was one of them, but he was not unique in his message, that the kingdom of heaven was returning. So any questions about this history? Are you guys clear? Okay, let's continue. So, this is the history, but at the same time, what's happening is, because the Levant is really the center of the world, it's a meeting place in the world, every single major religion is in the Levant and Jesus is absorbing and trying to understand these different religions. Okay? So, let's talk about the major religions. You have the Greeks with Plato, okay? So let's remind ourselves of what Platonic philosophy is. Plato believes God is called the form of the good, from the good. And from the form of the good will emanate other ideas like reason, truth, beauty, justice. And then these will emanate physical manifestations called the forms. This is called the realm of the forms. This is basically heaven. You can see this as heaven. We live in a shadow reality which is just an imitation of the form of the good. And our objective in life is to study philosophy in order to return to the form of the good. Only mathematics will help us return to the form of the good. Plato got this idea from the Egyptians. The Egyptians called this idea sacred geometry, mathematics. Because sacred geometry is a language and thought of the gods. Does that make sense? That's what Plato is. Also at this time, because of the influence of the Persians, you have Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism. Remember, in Zoroastrianism, the Creator is a Hora Masta. He is the perfect God of light. And he creates a perfect world where we humans are free to choose whatever we want. This world eventually became corrupted by an evil God who is equal to a Zoroastrian. And now we humans must fight for good. We can choose to fight for evil. But if we fight for good, that will allow good to win out in the end. Eventually, we'll emerge a savior, a mazaya, a hero, who will lead the Army of Light into a final battle against the army of darkness. And in this battle, the Army of Light will triumph. And then we'll emerge a river. And then everyone who's ever died will be resurrected from the dead. And everyone will be forced to cross this river. If you've been a good person, if you've fought for the truth, if you've been compassionate, you will cross this river and you will feel cleansed of all your sins and your mistakes. And you will emerge as a perfect soul who will live in paradise forever. But if you've been a bad person, You will burn in this river and then you'll be condemned to suffering for eternity. Okay? This is Zoroastrianism. Then you have Buddhism and Hinduism. Okay? And again, guys, remember, this world is interconnected. So the Greeks know Buddhism very well and the Buddhists know the Greeks very well. So, and Jesus will have access to Buddhist and Hindu teachings. In the Buddhist and Hindu tradition, there's a true reality called Brahmin. Okay, so let's think of this as a form of the good. We live in a false reality, where we have to suffer in pain. But through our good works, through Dharma, we can achieve moksha. What is moksha? Emotion means liberation back into the Brahmin. So Hinduism is very similar to Platonism. At the same time, besides religions, there are also major philosophies that are roaming around this area. So you have Sogism, which is what the Romans believe. You have Sinism, and you have Epicurism. So these are some of the major ones. Sinism is what Jesus believed, which It's a rejection of all material reality. Cynics believe that it's important to wear bad clothes and to beg for food because material reality is a lie or it's evil. At the same time, you also have these, what we call pagan religions or pagan rituals, usually around the cult of Dianese. We will talk about this later on in our class. This is very important. But all I want you to remember is, these are pagan rituals where people come together and they use psychedelics, they use drugs, to get really high in order to increase their religious ecstasy. And this is to create a feeling of oneness, interconnectedness. What's really important of these pagan rituals is to focus on egalitarianism. So you can be a slave, you can be a rich person. But once you enter these rituals, you're all one and the same. And they reject the social hierarchy of the real world. Not all, but many of these pagan rituals do that. So as you can see, at this time, there's just tremendous religious fever in the world. Everyone's seeking truth. Everyone's seeking a more peaceful, more interconnected, a more real world. And Jesus is operating within this major climate. And Jesus is a major religious, sorry, Jesus is a unique religious genius who is able to synthesize all these ideas into a new religion, okay? But it's not called Christianity, right? It's not called Christianity. Jesus is not the one who is the founder of Christianity. That person's named Paul. We'll do Paul next class. But Jesus found a new religion that attracts major followers. And so what is this new religion called? So at that time, obviously, there was not a name for this new religion. But today, we call this new religion Nazism. Jesus was the founder of a religion called Nazism. Not Christianity, Nazism. There's a difference. So what is Nazism? All right, if you look at most religions, there are three major leers. There's a secret leer, okay, which is only available to the founder as well as his closest followers. There is a inner leer, okay, an inner leer, which is what he teaches his disciples. And there is a public leer, an outer leer, okay, which is what he preaches to the public. Okay, do you understand? So most religions will have this three-tower system, a secret layer, which is a secret teachings, an inner layer, which is what the disciples are taught, and then there's a public layer. Okay? So, and what's important to first understand is these three layers operate at different levels and they speak different truths, but they're all interconnected. Okay? They're coherent and they're one and the same. All right? So Jesus was a Gnostic. What does this mean? Let's look at the outer layer. What Jesus was preaching was a religion of compassion, of forgiveness, of mercy, of egalitarianism. So let's look at Matthew, the Gospel of Matthew. This is from the Sermon on the Mount. And this is what he says, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. The people in this world who have value are not the rich, but the poor, because God favors them. If you're a poor person, you will find solace and comfort in this idea. You may be poor, you may not be able to eat enough, but God loves you the most. So this is what Jesus teaches the public. But then the question then is, why would this be true? Why would this be true? And so for this makes sense, we need to understand the inner and the secret layer, which is not revealed to us in Matthew. But there's a secret gospel called the Gospel of Thomas, which we recently discovered. This was discovered in 1945 in a town called Nag Hammadi. And this gospel is not in the Bible, but it reveals to us what Jesus thinks. So let's look at what he says. There are two things. There is light within a man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness. What does this mean? It can mean many things. And as I explained to you, you can look at this quotation from three different layers. At the public layer, there's light within the man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness. In the public layer, it means we have to be good people. God favors people who do good things, who are generous, who are compassionate. That's a public layer. Then there's an inner layer. And the inner layer is, what he's saying to his disciples is, if you want to follow me, you must give up the world. If you're wealthy, give up your wealth. If you're poor, give up your children and your wife and follow me. Be an example to everyone else. But there's also a secret layer. A secret layer. And let's look at the secret layer. The secret layer is a secret knowledge about the world, a secret understanding of how the world works, that only Jesus and his closest followers understand and recognize. And this is what we call Nazism. The idea is this. And it basically follows along lots of Plato and Buddhism, Hinduism. All right, in the beginning, there There's a god, a perfect god called the monad, or the one. And he's perfect. He is eternal, he is immutable, and he's perfect. The god of Plato. The monad creates dyads, peers that are perfect. One of them is called Sophia. And then these peers create, with the permission of a monad, triads. And this is all a perfect world. Because perfection creates perfection. The problem is one of these gods, Sophia, which is knowledge, she decides she can be like a monad. Remember, what makes a monad special is he creates new things out of his own thoughts. The dyads are forced to couple with each other in order to create new things. So Sophia wants to create her own thing herself, without permission of her partner or permission of the monad. But when she did that, she's defying the rules of the universe. And therefore, she creates a monster. This is a monster. And Sophia is ashamed by what she's done. She's like, oh my god, this was a mistake. This was a travesty. So what she does is she hides this monster in a different reality. She clouds up this reality. And this monster is ignorant of the true reality. So the monster doesn't know that he's a monster and he thinks he's a god. And he's lonely, so he starts to create the world, us. In the Bible, the monster's name is Yahweh. And he creates Adam and Eve and he creates the world. And the world is completely screwed up because it's all being created by a monster. And so this is the origin of sin and corruption and evil in this world. because our God is a monster who is in the finds of the true God. Okay? And that's why, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Because if you're poor, you are defying the material reality. To win in this game created by a monster, you yourself have to become a monster. Therefore, the wealthy, the powerful are evil people. If you're poor, you don't participate in this evilness and therefore you are blessed by God. And it was God who will redeem you and reward you at the end of the world. And who is Jesus? Jesus is the son of the monad who has come to the world to reveal us this truth about our world. And this is what he says. There There is a light within the man of light and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness. We, our bodies are evil. Why? Because we feel pain. We die. A perfect God would not make us alive because it makes no sense. Why would a perfect God condemn his children to suffer? We suffer every day. That makes no sense. Only a monster would do this. But even though the monster creates us, there is still a divine spark in us that comes from the monad. And if we recognize this and we choose a life of goodness by seeking true knowledge, this light will let the world. But if we do not do this, then we'll continue to suffer in darkness. And this is what the secret teaching is. Guys, in each of us, there's a divine spark of the monad. And so we can defy or escape this reality created by a monster. But you have to recognize this, okay? And this is a secret teaching of Jesus. All right, let's look at one more quotation from the Gospel of Thomas to truly understand this idea. When you make the two one and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside and the above like the below. And when you make the male and the female one the same so that the male not be male or female, and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, then will you enter the kingdom? How can you escape this world? You can escape this world by seeing this world, everything is interconnected. These categories, rich, poor, male, female, are created by the authorities in this world who worship a monster. We must recognize the connectedness of the humanity in each and every one of us. That's what's important to show mercy, to be compassionate, because we're all stuck together. And it's only by recognizing our common humanity that will allow us to escape this world. When you fashion your eyes in a place of life, when you truly see, then you'll escape. You have eyes and you think that what you see is true, But it's not true, it's all fake. It's all a lie. You have to see with your soul, with the divine spark that is in you. And then you will see the truth. All right? In this religion, why did Jesus die? Well, I mean, he died because it's a good thing. Okay, if you die, you are able to escape back into the true reality. But also, he died in order to awaken us, to inspire us, to grab our attention. Because his death was so tragic that it all of us into focused our attention into Jesus. And when we focus on Jesus, we focus on his teachings. And slowly over time, for our own self-discovery process, we're able to recognize the true teaching, the secret teaching of Jesus. And once we recognize the true teaching of Jesus, We're able to practice a compassionate, generous, and merciful life. We're able to bring light onto the world, and in our death, we're able to escape back into the true reality. And that's the true teaching of Jesus. So does that make sense, guys? So now that we've reconstructed his true belief, let's look at his life. What happened? So Jesus at some point, he's able to develop his theory of the world, his religion. And if you believe in your theory, you want to spread it out, okay? You want people to know your theory. So he goes to Jerusalem, which is the religious capital of the Jews, okay? If you want people to pay attention to you, and you want people to recognize you're speaking the truth, you have to go to Jerusalem. The problem is this. First of all, the Romans are in Jerusalem and they want to kill prophets because they see Jewish prophets as problematic. Second problem is, when you go to Jerusalem, you're competing against other religious authorities. Okay? You're now threatening the authority of the seduces, the Pharisees, and the Essenes. But Jesus doesn't have protectors. He doesn't have like a powerful political faction protecting him. So the Romans saw an opportunity to teach a Jew a lesson. So he arrested him and then he crucified him. Does that make sense? But as it did so, what they didn't recognize is this would turn him into a hero. Because at this time, everyone is thinking about apocalyptic eschatology. They're thinking the world is ending, the Messiah is coming. And they are so shocked by the death of Jesus that they start to talk about him. Okay? Let's do a thought experiment. Let's just say I'm a king and everyone hates me. Everyone hates me. I'm a king but everyone hates me. And there are three prophets who speak up against me. Okay? The first prophet, prophet A says, I am a son of a whore. Okay? My mother was a prostitute. The prophet B is, I kill my brother to use up the throne. Okay? That's what prophet B says. Prophet C says, I steal from the army. Okay? The money that's supposed to go to the army, I steal. All right? So these are three prophets who talk trash about me. And the people are confused as to who to believe. Who do I follow? Prophet A, Prophet B or Prophet C, right? So how do you know someone's speaking the truth? Well you know when the king kills someone, right? Does that make sense? If I kill Prophet B, it means of Prophet B must be speaking the truth. And therefore, you will start to follow the teachings of Prophet B. Okay? So, in this time, because the Romans killed Jesus, they turned Jesus into a hero. And people are now interested in the teachings of Jesus. And that's why he became so famous. Okay? And also, if you think about it, Nazism is really appealing to people. It makes a lot of sense. But then comes the most important question in Christianity, which is this. If Jesus himself was a Gnostic, if this is what he taught, that there is a light in us and we must constantly work hard to let the world to shine the world with our lightness, How did we go from here, Nazism, to the Bible, modern day Christianity, which teaches us that Jesus came to the world to redeem us from our sins, and that He will return to save the world? How did we get from here to here? And these are like two radically different conceptions of the world. In fact, if Jesus were alive today and he saw that we worshiped him as a redeemer, he would be appalled by what he's seen. He would be appalled by Christianity. And so this is what we will discuss next class. What I will show you next class is the true founder of Christianity. The person who developed this religion is not Jesus, but Paul. Paul. So Christianity, the religion about Jesus, is very different from Jesus and what he really taught. Was this clear to you guys? Any questions? Do you have any questions I call? So next class we will look at Paul."}

So we are today doing the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. And this topic is extremely relevant today because there's a country in the world that purposefully literally modeled itself out of Rome. And this country is the United States of America. The similarities between Rome and the United States, it's very striking. Both of these societies were of their time the most powerful nations. Rome dominated the Western world for centuries. And today, America is the world's most powerful nation. In fact, America is so powerful that if the entire world were to get together and decide for whatever reason to invade and attack America and not stop until America was defeated, well, if that would have happened, America would win. America is really invincible. It's protected by two oceans and it has infinite resources and it has an extremely aggressive population and the world's most sophisticated military. So by setting Rome, we gather insight into America, where America is right now in its history and where America is headed. And the central argument I will make to you today is that both of these societies, Rome and America, are really war machines. They're extremely aggressive. And if they cannot turn their aggression outwards, they turn their aggression inwards. Rome throughout its history was either fighting wars against its enemies, and then when it It ran out of enemies, it fought wars within itself, which ultimately led to its decline and collapse. America is in a very similar situation. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, America became hyperpower. It had no competitors, it has no peers in the world. Even though it tries very hard to look for enemies, for example, for the past 10 years, America has been trying to pay China as new threat. America really has no adversaries. And as a result, it can't really be aggressive abroad. So this will lead to, if the history of Rome is an indicator, it will probably lead to a massive civil war in America in the next 10 years. So that's what the history of Rome tells us. Okay, so today I want to look at three questions. The first question is, what did Rome rise? What allowed Rome to become an empire, a superpower of its time? The second question is, what did Rome ultimately decline and fall? And the third question is, what is the legacy of Rome? What is the impact and influence of Rome in today's world? Okay, let's look at the first question. So Rome, the tradition, we don't actually know if this is true or not, but the tradition is that Rome was founded in 753 BCE. And for that early history, Rome was a monarchy. It had a king. Then in 509 BCE, it became a republic. public. Now, democracy a republic. And then, and at that point, Rome was very much a poor backward and isolated city along the Tiber. And at that point in its history, no one, okay, not even the Romans could have predicted that in 300 years' time, Rome would become the master of its world, the Mediterranean. So to understand why Rome was able to succeed, let me very quickly draw for you a map of the world, the Mediterranean, in about 500 BCE, when the Roman Republic was founded. So at the center of this world was really the Persian Empire. The Persian Empire was in control of the world's three most prosperous regions. Egypt and Anatolia, which is modern day Turkey, and Mesopotamia, which is modern day Iraq. And these are the three most fertile regions of the Western world. It was extremely prosperous, very heavily populated. And the Persian Empire was in control of all three regions. So the Persian Empire is like this. Across the Aegean and the Mediterranean from the Persian Empire are the Greeks. You had Athens and you had Sparta. And these were the two dominant city states, or what we call Polis on the Greek mainland. Across the Aegean Ratic is of course Italy. And the dominant power actually in Italy at this time are not the Romans, but a cultural civilization we call the Etruscans. And the Etruscans, for the longest time, were dominant over the Romans. In fact, some people believe that Rome was originally a colony of the Etruscans, and the first kings of Rome were actually Etruscan princes. And then over here is a place called Carthage, which is an emerging power. And over here, above the Greeks, are the Macedonians. So these are the major cultures and powers of that time. Now, one of these powers will eventually dominate and then provide the cultural framework for all of Western civilization. And if we were to go back in time and we were to analyze this situation, then we could make some predictions. Our first prediction would be that Persia would eventually conquer all of Europe. Because Persia had infinite wealth, it had infinite resources, it was a superpower that was intent on aggression. And in fact, as we know, eventually it will launch an invasion of the Greek mainland. So if we were to predict or guess who would dominate the world, we would think it would be Persia. That's our first guess. But let's just say, then who would be second? Well, we would think that either Athens or Sparta would be second. Why? Because Athens has a navy. And it is a really powerful navy. And at this time, Greek civilization, it's really growing. So we would guess Athens or Sparta. And remember, Athens has a navy, but Sparta is really a military hegemon. It is focused on being a military powerhouse. And it has really the best military in Greece at this time. So our third guess might be Sparta. Then we could guess Carthage. Why? Because Carthage is strategically located in northern Africa, which gives it access to all trade routes in Africa over here, into all of Europe, and then back to the Mediterranean. So Carthage would also be a good guess. We would not guess Macedonia. Why? Because Macedonia is a poor, backward kingdom north of Greece, that's being controlled right now by the Persians. We would never guess the Macedonians. But then there's one city that we would never, ever believe could dominate the world, and that's Rome. Rome would not be on a list. Macedonia might be on the list because it still has strategic location, it has a very militant population, but we would never, ever guess Rome. So what's funny about these predictions, of course, is that eventually Rome does conquer the entire Mediterranean world, and it becomes the superpower of its time, and then it develops the cultural framework for all of Western civilization. But not only that, but close to Rome is Macedonia. Because remember, Macedonia is where, for the second, builds the world's most powerful military, and where absent a great comes from to conquer all the Persian Empire. Okay? So it's very strange that the nations that either are not on the list or are the bottom list will eventually conquer the world. All right? And this goes back to our first class where we talk about the oceanic currents of history. How empires are destined to fall, to decline, and to put in the process, They energize these borderlands and empower these borderlands to rise eventually over time to overwhelm the empire. So this is true for Macedonia, and this is certainly true for Rome. So this fits into our pattern of the oceanic currents of history. So there are many different reasons why Rome would eventually win out over its competitors in the Mediterranean. What I want to focus on today are the cultural reasons. So my argument today is that Rome, in opposition to its enemies, developed a cultural system that allowed it to triumph over its enemies. This cultural system made it ideal for military competition against its major enemies. So let's talk about this cultural system. And to understand this cultural system, I will compare and contrast it with the Greeks, who are also, who are basically the most culturally dominant people in this area at this time. Okay, so what do the Greeks believe in? Well, the Greeks believe in three things, the Greek system. When I mean Greeks, I basically mean the Athenians, okay? Because the Athenians were the culturally dominant nation in the Greek world. All right, so what do the Greeks believe in and how were the Romans different? Well, first we understand is that Greeks were culturally dominant. And so what happened was that Romans did up a lot of their cultural system in opposition to the Greeks or they learn lessons from the Greeks. Okay, so think about as an analogy the relationship between China and Japan. A lot of Japanese cultural systems and values were developed in opposition to China and because of the lessons that the Japanese learned from Chinese history. Okay? So, let's talk about the Greek values And then what values the Romans developed in opposition to the Greeks, okay? So the first value the Greeks developed was the idea of freedom. What is freedom? Freedom represents an egalitarian society in which everyone has the right to speak his mind, his, not hers, okay? His mind. So every citizen was considered equal. And that was the basis for great democracy. Everyone has the right. Everyone has the right to speak if you're a citizen. Now what is the Roman counterpart? The Roman counterpart is what we call liberty. And they sound similar, but they're actually very different concepts. Freedom is the right to speak your mind, the right to live your life. Liberty is the respect for the laws, laws, history and traditions of your culture. Because that's what enables you to be free. If we don't respect the laws, it'd be anarchy. Also, liberty means basically no king. Okay? We will never allow a king to rule us. Because he takes away our liberty. What's interesting for us is the modern Western concept, is more aligned with the Romans than the Greeks. When you think of freedom and liberty, we think of the Roman idea, not the Greek idea, okay? So liberty. The Roman word for this is of course, libertas. All right, the second idea, value of the Greeks is the idea of eudaimonia. Eudaimonia is the pursuit of human flourishing. to be the best that you can be, to be better than your peers, and to win respect for your peers, to seek glory, to seek honor. So let's go back to last semester and think about Achilles in the epic, the Iliad. Achilles was in Troy, not to win glory for the Greek people, but to win glory for himself. He was extremely selfish, he was extremely competitive, And he was so competitive that when he, about in the battlefield, he basically asked his mother, Thetis, the goddess, to get Zeus, the high god, to favor the Trojans, okay? This is treason, this is sedition. And for the Greeks, this is good because what's important is to win Eudaimonia. You, in order to achieve Eudaimonia, can do anything, because that's what matters, okay? And the idea of eudaimonia, if you think about it, it's what led to great creativity, which everyone saw society as a competition, and they want to be the best. But if you think about it, also leads to corruption and selfishness. So the Romans didn't like eudaimonia. Instead, their highest virtue was the idea of republica. And this is where we get the word republic from. Republic means for the greater good, for the public virtue. So what's important is not that you would glory for yourself but to sacrifice yourself for the greater good, for the good of Rome. That's what made you a good person or the best person to fight and die for Rome. And the third value for the Greeks that matter was the erite. Erite just means excellence. So even though Achilles was a jerk, the Greeks still admired him. Why? Because he's a great soldier. On the battlefield, he was fabulous. He was excellent. And therefore, he should be admired. The Romans didn't like this. They didn't want people to outshine everyone else. So they prefer the concept of piety. Obedience, loyalty to your fathers, to Rome, to the gods, piety is what mattered. The highest virtue in Rome is not erite, it is piety. And again, a lot of Roman values was developed in response to the Greeks, especially to the Athenians, okay? Because remember, the Athenians in 480, they defeated the Persians. And the Athenians became basically an empire. They were the dominant military force in the Mediterranean and the Aegean of that time. But 80 years later, 400, they had been decimated. They had been destroyed. They fought against Sparta in the Peloponnesian War, and they lost. The Romans witnessed all this because they were just across from the Adriatic. They knew all this. And so they were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Athenians. And that's why they developed a system in opposition to the Greeks, the Athenians. The Athenians had democracy. And it was common wisdom at the time that it was the democratic system that caused the collapse of the Athenian Empire. And in response, the Romans developed a system called the Republic. Now, there's a huge difference between democracy and republic. They sound the same. And in today's world, we use these two concepts interchangeably. We say American democracy. We say American republic. It means the same thing. But back then, democracy and republic were two opposing systems. So let me give you an example to show you how different the system is. So democracy is basically one man, one vote. It encourages competition, encourages debate, encourages free thought. Republic is to be ruled by institutions, basically the Senate, institutions, by laws, and by history or tradition. So what's the difference? All right, let's pretend that we're all gonna go out for lunch today. And each of us has a different opinion. I want to go to McDonald's, Eva wants to go and get dumplings, Echo wants to go to pizza. Who knows, okay? But we all have these different opinions. And at democracy, we resolve this issue by having to debate. I make my argument for my idea, then you all make your argument for your ideas, okay? And then we vote, and then majority wins. Simple, right? Okay, a republic is different. or republic, you make your decisions based on tradition. So for example, today is Thursday. And for whatever reason, we don't know why, but every Thursday we go out to get dumplings. So guess what? We just go and get dumplings. We don't ask why. We don't even know why. We may not even like dumplings. It doesn't matter. What matters is you respect and follow the tradition set by your fathers. Does that make sense? Now, what's interesting is these two systems have benefits and consequences. And it's the idea of the republic that allows Rome to eventually conquer the entire Mediterranean. And the reason why is the idea of a republic solves a problem that democracy cannot solve. It's the idea of citizenship. and identity. The way you organize your society is basically full citizenship. Who gets to be a citizen? Who doesn't? And the democracy is actually very hard to be a citizen. Because if we are having a debate and competition, we don't want others coming into the system. There's four of us in the classroom. We debate. But let's just say we let in five other people. And these five other people all love noodles. Guess what? We're stuck going to noodles every day, right? So we don't want newcomers. And that's why the Athenian Empire fell. The Athenian Empire had to fight these wars to protect its empire. But in each battle, it had to lose soldiers. Even if you win battles, you have to lose soldiers. And it could not replenish these soldiers because it did not want foreigners to become citizens. Does that make sense? But in the Republic, you do not have this problem. If we are Republic, we all start going to noodles every Thursday, we let in 100 people. Doesn't matter, we're all going to noodles. It doesn't affect us. So the beauty of the Republic is you can allow immigrants and foreigners to come into your system, which allows you to replenish your military. And they become citizens if they are willing to fight for you and if they're willing to follow your traditions, your customs, your history. And it's very similar in America. In China, how are you a citizen? We are born here. And both your parents are Chinese. And that's it. There's no other way to become a Chinese citizen. But in America, you can immigrate and just say, I swear to obey the Constitution. I swear to protect the Constitution. If you say those words, you can become a US citizen. So that's the power of the Republic. So let's talk about some historical example to illustrate the difference between a democracy and a republic. Well, in the democracy, people understand polis, or society, as a community of people. So the example is in 480 the Persians invaded the Greek mainland and they were about to attack Athens And there's no way that Athens could withstand the Persian onslaught. So what do they do? Well, what they did was they got Onto the ships and they sailed away the entire Athenian people the entire city of Athens got onto the ships and sailed away and And the persons were like, well, you can't do that. And the Athens says, yes, we can. Because as a community, we can be wherever we want. We don't have to be in Athens. As long as we're a community, we will be Athens. We can leave Athens and go south to Africa. And we will still be Athens. That's the idea of community. But the Romans didn't believe that. Remember in 216, Hannibal comes and attacks the Italian peninsula. He destroys and wipes out all the Roman armies. Rome has no army. And at this point, Rome has options. It can surrender or it can leave. It cannot leave because to leave Rome would be to abandon its identity as a Roman people. your republic, the place does matter. Once you leave the place, you abandon the values, the culture, the history that makes you distinctly Roman. So the Romans said to Hannibal, we will not surrender. We will fight the last man if you come and attack us. And Hannibal never did, okay? And what's really funny about this incident is It's really the proudest moment in Roman history. They were up against impossible odds. They had no army. Hannibal was the greatest general in human history. He had a huge army. But the Roman people were willing to make all the necessary sacrifices in order to protect their identity and their values and their history. They refused that Rome fall. So every person, whether it's woman, man, or child, would have taken arms and defended the city against Hannibal. And this was really the highlight of the Republican system. It refuses to surrender because to surrender would mean abandoning its identity. So that's why Rome was able to defeat all its enemies. Because the Roman idea of citizenship was flexible. If you're willing to fight for Rome, you could become a citizen. And as such, Rome was able to draw soldiers from all the Italian peninsula. From 280 to 272 BCE, there's something called the Great Wars. Pyrrhus, who was a Greek king, came to the aid of the Greek colonies in Italy. These Greeks were complaining and saying that Romans are bullying us. Can someone please help us and build us a Greek empire? So, Pyrrhus comes and attacks the Romans, and he won every battle. The Romans were terrible soldiers. He had the best soldiers in the world, and he was winning every battle. And at a certain point, Pyrrhus said, okay, we're killing a lot of Romans. But if I win one more battle, if I just win one more battle, I'm going to run out of soldiers. So we have to retreat. Okay? And this is because of the idea of citizenship. The Greeks could not replenish their forces, whereas the Romans could. Okay? And this is what allowed for social mobility and innovation in Rome. The fact that Rome was constantly fighting these battles, these wars against everyone, and learning from their mistakes, and growing as military power. Eventually, Rome comes in conflict with Carthage. And Carthage is, at this point, the greatest military, sorry, the greatest naval power of the Mediterranean. Rome did not have a navy. It doesn't know how to sail ships. Guess what it did? Guess what happened? They decided to build a navy. And they lost a lot of battles against Carthage. But again, because Rome was so persistent, because Rome was not afraid to lose soldiers. Eventually it overwhelmed Carthage. Okay? So this is the reason why eventually Rome was able to conquer the entire Mediterranean world. No one could stop Rome. Okay? So by about 200 BCE, Rome was the greatest military hegemon of that time. About 100 BC, 100 years later, it was an empire. So are you guys clear? Any questions so far before I continue? Are you guys clear about this? All right. But there's a problem when Rome became an empire. Republic is not the same as an empire. An empire needed a bureaucracy. It needed an emperor. You need a top-down system. And that's in conflict with the idea of a republic, where you have to obey the history and the institutions. If you're an empire, you have to absorb new people into your culture. But the women still want to do that because it meant giving up their own culture, right? So this created a contradiction, it just created a paradox. And this will eventually lead to a series of civil wars That really never stops until Rome collapses. So punishment is idea, think about America today. America, again, it is humanity's greatest empire. It controls the entire world, basically. It has 800 military bases around the world. China has about two. It has no peer comparator. But there's one thing that you cannot say about America. If you want Americans to say, you're an empire, you'll be shut down. How dear you say we're an empire. There's nothing imperial about us. We're republic. We're a democracy. We're not an empire. For whatever reason, Americans refuse to believe they're an empire. It's ridiculous. And you have some silly things. For example, when Americans talk about the Middle East, right? Clearly, America wants to control the Middle East for its resources. But when you talk to American academics, American people, for the reason they believe American Middle East policy is being controlled by Israel, a nation of 8 million people in the desert. Israel is able to control the American empire. And you're like, that makes no sense. How is it possible for Israel to control America? But Americans really believe this. If you talk about the war in Ukraine, there are a lot of Americans who believe that it's the Europeans who are making America assist Ukraine. It's all European manipulation. And it's the silliest thing. It's like, what are you talking about? The Europeans are a vassal state of America. Israel is a vassal state of America. And the reason why is Americans cannot understand that they're an empire, because it goes against their idea of themselves as democracy, as a republic. All right, this is what we call, the word for this is called cognitive dissonance. You guys should have studied this in psychology, okay? But it's impossible for your mind to hold in place two concrete ideas. America cannot both be a republic and an empire, therefore it's a republic. And don't ever mention the word empire, okay? And guess what? The Romans had the same problem. They could not conceive of themselves as an empire, and they refused to be an empire even though they were an empire. And this led to lots of civil wars and conflicts between Rome and the people around Rome. Okay? So the example is that from 91 to 89, Rome fought something called the social war. Remember, this is after Rome became an empire. It now has no pair competitor. It has no adversary. So now it starts to fight wars among its own people. The social war was fought between Rome and its Italian allies or neighbors. For most of its history, Rome was drawing soldiers from its allies. And after Rome became an empire, its allies, Italian allies, rightfully said, listen, we fought for you for decades. We've lost many men. We demand to be given citizenship. And Rome said, no. And so they fought a civil war. And Rome lost the civil war because guess what? its military was from the Italian peninsula. So it could not defeat its allies, and so it had to make its allies into Roman citizens. And Rome will keep on doing this, where it has all these subject people, and subject people rebel because they want citizenship. But again, for Rome, what matters is the protection of its cultural identity. And if you give citizenship to too many people, that deludes your cultural identity. They were afraid that Rome will stop being Rome, and that led to conflicts throughout its history. And it never really ended. So you can't ever use the word empire or emperor in Rome. Then the question then is, wait, didn't Agatha Caesar, after the Battle of Actium, the first Roman emperor? No, okay? The idea of an empire, the idea of an emperor, the idea that Augustus Caesar was the first emperor, is something that later historians decided on. The Romans did not see themselves as an empire. And Augustus Caesar did not see himself as an emperor. The word he used, the word the Romans used is the idea of precept. The concept is means in Latin, first citizen. We are still equals, meaning senators, okay? But I'm just a bit better than you. I'm the first among equals. And this is where we get the English word prince from. And August Caesar did not see himself as, but an empire, he saw himself as saving the republic. Now, what's important to understand is that August Caesar was considered the greatest Roman leader, because he ruled for 50-plus years. His was a very stable regime. And the reason why, if you recall from last semester, is he was the heir to Julius Caesar. And there was tremendous regret and guilt among the Roman people for having killed Julius Caesar. And so they allowed his here, his son, to be king or emperor without much opposition. That was not true for his hears. So after Augustus Caesar died, all these civil wars and conflicts that were suppressed were now fomented again. and this would now lead to a massive period of civil wars. Now, our understanding of Roman history comes a lot from Roman historians themselves, specifically two individuals, Livy and Tacitus. And we basically listen to what they wrote. For example, so what we mean by that is, we take their word as gospel, take the word as truth. But what we need to recognize is they were senators, part of the nobility, who hated the emperors, who hated the princeps. So they did whatever they could in order to make the emperors look bad. So there were four emperors, sorry, there were three emperors after death of Augustus Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero. And they were all made to look very, very bad, especially Nero and Caligula and Tiberius. So let me give you an example of this. So after Augustus dies, Augustus names two people here to his legacy. The first is Tiberius, who becomes the emperor. Tiberius is not his son, it is his adopted son. So that's, that is a Roman tradition where you can adopt someone outside the family to be here. And then after Tiberius died, Augustus anointed Germanicus to be his successor. And Germanicus was considered an extremely talented and capable leader. The problem, though, is that Tiberius, who is now emperor, didn't like the fact that Germanicus was appointed his successor. He wanted to annoy his own successor. So Tiberius, what he did that was very sneaky was, he made a man named Sugenius, the head of the Paterian Guard. And the Paterian Guard was basically the secret police of Rome. And Sojannis, because he was very ambitious, he started to kill not just Germanicus, but everyone in Germanicus' family. Sojannis wanted to be the hearer through Tiberius. And then after Sojannis was done killing everyone, basically in Germanicus' family, Tiberius had him killed. This is a very common pattern in imperial history. Okay? After Sigenis was killed, there's a purge of Sigenis allies. His children were killed and everyone who supports Sigenis was interrogated by the Senate and put to death. And most of these people claim innocence. I had never done what Sigenis, I was forced into an alliance with Sigenis. Okay? Now, there's one person, a Roman normal man named Marcus Tarantius. who in 31 CE, he appeared before the Senate for his trial, and he decided on a different strategy. Everyone else before him claimed, I had nothing to do with Szeinus, and the Senate didn't believe them, and they were all killed, okay? So Marcus Trenes tries a different strategy, and this is recounted in the history book, Annals by Tacitus, who was running about 100 years later, okay? And this is what Marcus Trenas argues. He argues, yes, I was his friend. In fact, I tried very best to be his friend. Why? Because Sujennas had the favor of the emperor. Because if I wanted to get anything done, if I wanted to become wealthy, I had to become a friend of Sujennas. And why did I do this? And why was this right? because it is not up to me to question or think about why Tzigenes is a friend of the emperor. All I need to know was the emperor's favorite Tzigenes. And it is my duty to obey the emperor, and therefore I became his friend. That was his logic. Now, let's look at what Tasidus wrote. And it's really one of the most striking paragraphs in the history. But this is Marcus Serena's defense of himself before the Senate and the Emperor. It is not ours to ask whom you, the Emperor, exalt above his fellow or why you, the gods, have made sovereign arbiter of things. It is not my place to ever question the Emperor. If the Emperor made Sigenus his right-hand man, I now must also obey Sigenus. If the emperor wants me to marry a dog, I will go marry a dog. To search, to us, has been left the glory of obedience. To search out the hidden thoughts of the emperor and the designs he may shape in secret is unlawful and dangerous, nor would the searcher necessarily find. What does this mean? It means the emperor is God. He has a secret design. He has a secret logic that we could never know. because we're too stupid. And if we try to figure out, we're breaking the laws of Rome and the universe. And we can only get into trouble. So it's not up to me to question the emperor. It is only my duty to obey the emperor. The firmness of the speech, okay? So he's finished speaking, defending himself in front of the Senate. And this is how the emperor and the Senate respond to this speech. The firmness of the speech, he speaks with conviction, okay? conviction, okay? And the fact that a man had been discovered to utter what the world was thinking made so powerful an impression that his accusers were penalized by banishment or death, okay? So rather than punish this man, the Senate punished his accusers, his enemies. Why? Because they had found a man to speak the truth about the world. The emperor was in command, we had to obey the emperor. And they wanted to make a role model out of him, and therefore they killed all his enemies and let him go. And we warded him lavishly. Now, this was written in contrast to Roman history. This marks a radical departure from Roman history. Remember, in 509, the Republic was founded because they threw out the king. In response, the king organized his allies, the Jewish students, and they marched on Rome. And Rome was surrounded by a huge army. And there was nothing Rome could do about it. So a young nobleman named Moesius went to the senators and proposed a daring plan to assassinate the king. He swims across the Tiber. He goes into the camp of the enemy and he's captured. He's interrogated by the king. And Muxia says, we Romans have sworn to kill all kings. And to show that he's serious, he puts his hand into a fire and he burns his hand in front of the king. The king is scared, so he runs away. Okay? So this story shows us the nature of the Roman character. Romans hate kings. Romans will always disobey kings. Romans will always find a way to kill kings. And this speech shows us that the Roman character has fundamentally changed because of empire. Okay? So Romans throughout most of its history, the Roman people have been grappling with what it means to be Roman and how to protect this precious identity. Now, we know that even though Tacitus wrote this, the Roman identity didn't really change. How do we know this? How do we know that even though Tacitus says, okay, empire changed the Roman identity? It didn't really change. How do we know this? Because he's writing about this, right? He's writing about this. He's telling us that the Roman identity changed because of the empire. Well, if the red didn't really change, people wouldn't know it changed. It's only because people are resisting the change in nature, the changing character that people appreciate what Tassus is writing. And Tassus is really saying that, oh, that empire, it's gone now because the new emperor has restored the republic. So throughout its history, Rome was causing a battle between empire and republic. And every new emperor believed that he was restoring the republic. But then someone else would come along and say, no, he was the dictator. He was the emperor. So this was a conflict throughout Roman history. And so now the question, we go on to the second question which is, all right. How did the empire fall? Well, the standard explanation is that eventually, Rome became too corrupt. And this is an explanation provided by most Roman historians, as well as the very, as well as the famous British historian Edward Gibbon in his most famous work, History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It's corruption. It's because the Romans became more like the Greeks or like the Persians. They started to appreciate the luxury, decadence, and corruption of empire more. And the explanation is that over time, you had all these dramatic invaders from the steppes. Remember the steppes is where the Yanai people come from. These Visigoths are being pushed up by the Huns. So remember, steps is really this massive, competitive, world poor hurricane that makes people more aggressive and more aggressive tribes will push out less aggressive tribes. And these people are forced to go into Europe. And over time, the Romans are trying to absorb them into their empire by making them soldiers or by giving them land, okay? But over time, this peer population will force the empire to collapse, okay? And that's the center explanation. I wanna make a different argument. My argument is this. It really has to, again, with the idea of citizenship and identity. Throughout most of its history, Imperial Rome has been struggling with its identity issue. And then at some point an emperor came along and said, screw this, we no longer want to be republic, we want to be an empire. Okay? And the way we resolve this issue is in 212, the emperor Caracalla issued the edict of Caracalla, which made everyone in Roman empire a citizen. So he basically destroyed the idea of citizenship. If everyone can be a citizen, citizenship means nothing. Before you had to fight for Rome, you had to die for Rome in order to become a citizen. You had to believe in the customs, the history, the tradition of Rome to become a citizen. You had to fight for it. It was valuable. It was in fact, it was the most valuable thing in the world for people. But now everyone got it, so it was absolutely worthless. Okay? And because everyone was now a Roman citizen, there was now no more Roman identity. It was now a clean slate. The emperors were now no longer bounded by tradition or history, by institutions like the Senate. And so now they could build the imperial bureaucracy. And this imperial bureaucracy will replace the republic. And the major change is in 330, the emperor of Constantine will move the capital from Rome to a place called Byzantium, which will become the Byzantine Empire, or the Eastern Roman Empire. We'll talk about this next class. But this is something that was unthinkable. How could you move the heart and center and soul of the empire from Rome to somewhere else? It was unthinkable. If, to be Roman, was meant to die for Rome, but not the capital of somewhere else. And so this marks basically the end of Rome as a cultural identity, as a cultural beacon. This marked really the death of the history of Rome. Does that make sense to you guys? Now historians argue about this. And historians argue when the Roman Empire fell. But the consensus is 476, when a German warlord that deposed the last emperor named Romulus Augustus. But I disagree. I believe that it really happened in 212 when Rome announced everyone could be a citizen. And we'll talk more about this next class when we get to the Byzantine Empire. So any questions so far? I know this is a lot, but we'll try to clarify about the issues over the next few classes. But if you have any questions now, please ask. Any questions so far about this? Is this clear to you guys? Yeah? Tassidus. Okay, all right. Let me clarify. Tassidus was a senator. The senator was always in conflict with the emperor. The Senate, okay. Sorry, let me clarify about Senate. The Senate was basically the Roman aristocracy. It was where the ruling families of Rome sat. And they were supposed to be in charge of the empire. And the emperor was basically like the CEO. He was basically in charge of managing the empire. But it was the Senate that was supposed to make the decisions. In reality, it was the emperor who was in charge, because the emperor controlled the army, and he controlled the paternal guard, which was the secret police. So he could kill senators who disobeyed him. And this was also a very complex relationship. So when Tacitus, again, who is a senator, who comes from one of the elite families of Rome, when he's writing about the history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to Nero, he's trying to paint them in a very bad light, okay? Because he's trying to tell us, emperors are bad, what's good is a Senate. And that's why he's producing the speech. because if you're a Roman citizen and you read this speech by Marcus Terenes, you are appalled, you're disgusted. We're Romans, we hate kings. We do not obey, we fight, we do not surrender. Okay, so this speech goes against the very heart and soul of what it means to be a Roman. And that's why Tassus is writing this. You see what empire does to the Roman character. It corrupts us, it destroys us. it weakens us and therefore we must resist the emperor and protect the senate. Does that make sense, guys? So thanks for that. So I apologize because I'm running through a lot of history in a short amount of time. So I'm missing a lot of important details. What's really important for you to understand is in the Republic, the senate is in charge. Meaning the ruling houses. They are stocking seats in charge. But in an empire, the emperor is in charge. But Rome never resolved this issue. Who should be in charge, the Senate or the emperor? And it changed over time. Sometimes the Senate's in charge, sometimes the emperor's in charge. But they all believe they're protecting the republic. And this creates quantum dissonance. And it creates a lot of confusion. And then in 212, the emperor said, screw this. Let's just be an empire. I don't want the Senate anymore. And this begins a process of creating the Byzantium Empire, which does not have the idea of a Roman character. Do you have a question, Echo? Exactly, yeah. The Senate is filled by, again, members of the ruling houses. And what's interesting about this system is, it's almost like a federal system. I'm not sure you even know what a federal system is. But the emperor is in charge of the army, and he's in charge of the secret police in Rome. But the senators are actually in charge of the provinces. So basically, each senator gets a certain province to control. So it's like the United States where governors are in charge of a state, the president is in charge of the nation. Now what's important for you to understand is technically each state is independent. Each state has its own army, has its own basically legal system. And it agrees to be part of the federal system, which the president is part of. And this is very similar to the Roman system. not exactly, but it's very similar. All right? Okay, any more questions before I conclude? Okay, so my, the last question I wanted to look at today is what's the legacy of the Roman Empire or the Republic? And the answer is we still live in the Roman world. Even though we like to think that we are heavily influenced by the Greeks, it's institutions of Rome that we've inherited, okay? So the idea of the political system, the legal system, the cultural system, it's something that the Americans basically copy and paste it. The American system is very, very Roman. And right now, of course, America controls the world. And therefore, it's able to disseminate Roman values and culture. And throughout the semester, we will be examining how Rome came to control the cultural framework of Western civilization. Because even though Rome collapsed and Rome, the character of Rome is now dead, the Roman legacy is still there. And all these people fighting these warlords, these basically German warlords, they're now going to fight the Civil War after the death of Rome. claiming to be carrying on the legacy of Rome. From their perspective, Rome has not died, but Rome has spread out. And these warlords will adopt a lot of Roman practices. And these warlords will build the culture that will give rise to new nations called France, Germany, Britain, basically the European world. So that's the legacy of Rome. That's why it's important to study Rome. What lessons, okay, what lessons can we draw from Rome? Well, one really important lesson that we have to learn here is the idea of citizenship and identity. You cannot be a strong and coherent nation if you do not have a strong cultural identity. That's why the Romans were so insistent on protecting that identity against the Greeks, against foreigners. Okay, and this is important because if you look at the Western world today, immigration, identity, and citizenship are huge political issues. I'm a Canadian citizen, I grew up in Canada. And over the past 10 years, the population of Canada went from like 30 million to 40 million. These 10 million people are all foreigners. We have no sense of Canadian identity. They have no interest in being Canadian. They just want a better life for themselves. 40% of Canadians now were either foreign born or have a parent who is a foreign born. So there's no more Canadian identity. And this is a problem. Why? Because the United States, Trump, wants to take over Canada and make Canada into the 51st state. And there's a problem because Canadians don't want to resist against this. 10 years ago, all Canadians would say, nope. But now you have 10 million Canadians who are very happy to join the United States because it means more opportunities for them. They don't care about cultural identity. So without controlling immigration, you as a nation can't be coherent and you will cease to exist over time. And the same is true about what's happening in Britain, throughout the Western world basically. They're landing too many immigrants and they're diluting their own cultural identity. So over the next 10, 20 years, a lot of people are predicting massive civil wars in the Western world as these nations grapple with the consequences of unlimited immigration these past 10 years. So that's one thing to think about. One lesson that we can learn from the Roman world. Citizenship does matter. Make it hard to become a citizen. Make it valuable. Make it an honor to be a citizen. And your nation will be strong. If citizenship is cheap, you can just buy it. It is worthless. and you will cease to be culturally coherent. And eventually you'll cease to exist as a nation. Okay, so that's the first major lesson. Second major lesson about Rome is it won out because it was a aggressive nation. But once you win out against your enemies, this aggression has to go somewhere. And it usually turns inward, okay? And that's why Rome kept on fighting the civil wars amongst itself. And the same is true for America. America is a nation that worships aggression. For example, think about the number of guns in America. There's like, I don't know the exact statistics, but there's about 400 million guns in America. America only has 200 million people. There are more guns than there are people in America. It worships violence. Also think about this. The most popular sport in America is American football. There's only one nation in the world that plays American football and that's America. No other nation plays it. Why? Because it is barbaric. You literally have people trying to kill each other for the entertainment and pleasure of spectators. It's barbaric. I'm not sure if you know this, but after five years of playing football, these athletes, the brains are mush. They commit suicide at age 30 or 35. So it's no different from gladiator sport in Rome, which Romans loved. So America is a violent society. If it cannot turn its violence outside, it will direct its violence and aggression inwards. So I think within the next 10 years, America will most likely start a war probably against Iran. So I'm predicting within the next five years, America will start a war against Iran, probably sooner, and then America will start a civil war as well. So civil war does not mean two sides fighting against each other. It just means that there'll be a lot of political killings, assassinations, a lot of violence in America, based on religious political differences. So the second lesson to learn from Rome. Aggression and violence will allow you to defeat your enemies. Once you do, this violence and aggression will turn inwards. And the third lesson that we can learn from Rome is, again, no societies are stable. Everything changes over time. So even though Rome was the dominant superpower of its time, it still collapsed. And the same is true for America today. So the world will change. And it always changes. So next class, we will look at the Roman Empire, which is basically the Byzantine Empire. Any questions about today's class? Are you guys clear? OK, great. So I will see you next class."}

So my main argument is that Kant is really taking the main thesis of Dante, which is the imagination is the animating force of the universe and love is the unifying force of the universe. And what he will do is he will use his epistemology. Episodic knowledge just means theory of knowledge. How do we know what we know? And then he will do three things. He will clarify it. So if you read Dante, it's not very explicit what he's saying. You have to interpret him properly. What Cotton will do is make Dante explicit to the world. Then he will rationalize it. Rationalize it just means that he will remove divinity. He will remove theology from it and create a system of logic. And so then he will systemize it. All right, so this is the mission of Kant, to take the secret of the universe as first presented in Dante and then create a system of logic that then is able to incorporate itself into science and history and philosophy in the world that we know. All right, so together Dante and Kant really did create the world that we live in today. All right, so let's first talk about the background. Like, why is Kant engaged in this project? So for most of Western history, there have been two major philosophers. They are Plato and Aristotle. And up until Kant, you could divide all philosophy into these two major camps. Plato believes that God is called the form of the good. Form of the good. So the form of the good, it is this perfect, immaculate, eternal force that emits, emanates, breathes, thinks. And then he creates something called the ideals. And these are the perfect conceptions of beauty, reason, justice. And then these ideals give rise to the forms. Okay, and these are the perfect encapsulation of these ideals. So think of the perfect horse, or the perfect chair, or the perfect square, okay? We live, this is the real world, okay? This is what is true and real. We live in the shadow world. So remember back to the allegory of the cave. So everything in the shadow world is only imitation of the forms. And so in this conception, what is good is to move towards the form of the good, to return to the form of the good, and what is evil is to move away from the form of the good. That's why for Plato, art, poetry is evil, because you're imitating imitation. And why for Plato, mathematics and philosophy are inherently good because it is teaching you how to return to the form of the good. And Plato's important because what happens is that Plato's ideas become the basis for heaven and earth. And so this is the basis for Christianity. Remember, in the Catholic Church doctrine, our life on this planet doesn't really matter. What matters is our return to heaven to be with God. And we say about Plato that he's a dualist. So there are three conceptions of the universe. There is the materialistic worldview, which is what Aristotle is. Materialistic just says that only things that you can see and touch matter. Idealistic is what Hegel represents, which is that only ideas matter. And then Plato believes that both matter and ideas do matter. So he's a dualist, whereas Aristotle is a materialist. So that's Plato. Pretty clear, right? Good. All right. Now let's move on to Aristotle. For Aristotle, his god is called a prime mover. The prime mover is the first thing that moves. Because when the first thing moves, it causes things to move as well. Okay, there's cause and effect. So in this world, what matters is movement. Okay, everything's moving towards what, towards something called telos. Which is what purpose is. It's a Greek word for purpose. So for example, as a teacher, my telos is to teach as well as I can. And my mission in life is to constantly learn to improve and to practice so that my teaching becomes better and better. that's the idea of telos. And we can understand, for observation and experience, what each thing's telos is. And then you can start to categorize things, okay? And Aristotle, his ideas, of course, become the basis for science. Okay, and as I mentioned, Aristotle has a materialistic worldview as opposed to Plato's dualistic worldview. Aristotle doesn't really care about things outside the material world. He's only concerned about the here and now. So these are the two major schools of thought during antiquity. Now, as I mentioned previously in class, as the Catholic Church comes into power and it has a monopoly of power, it suppresses these philosophical inquiries. But after the Renaissance, these schools of thought, Plato and Aristotle, they will reemerge, all right? So they will reemerge into three majors of schools of thought, okay? So taking up Plato's perspective, will be a people called the rationalists, okay? So the three most famous rationalists are René Descartes, Lemnix and Spinoza, okay? But they are basically adopting Plato's worldview, which is there is a God and through mathematics, through logic, we can from first principles reason out the mind of God. So the project of rationalism is towards apniseats. And again, this is best represented by Descartes. And this becomes, of course, the basis for the enlightenment. So that's the first major school thought, the rational. They're also called the continental. the continental philosophy because it's really based on the continent of Europe. Opposing the rationalists are the empiricists. And these are people who are adopting their stado worldview. The empiricists, the most famous, is John Locke. And what John Locke believes is our minds are born tabula rasa, which just means blank slate, meaning there's nothing in our minds. So the only way that we can acquire knowledge, acquire wisdom is through experience. Experience is something called induction. So in logic, there are two methods. The first is deduction, where you take the generalized to the specific, and then induction is to take the specific, and then you generalize it into the abstract. So for example, if I see five boys wearing white shirts, then I can generalize and say that all boys wear white shirts. But if the general principle is all boys wear white shirts, then from the deduction, I can say, well, you're a boy. Therefore, you wear a white shirt. So that's the idea of empiricism. And of course, this becomes a basis for what we call the scientific method. Now, there's another school of philosophy called skepticism. And this was pioneered mainly by a man named David Hume. And so what David Hume's going to do is he's going to look at this idea of induction and argue, no, you can't do that. You cannot generalize things. Just because you meet 1 million swan that are white does not mean that all swan are white. It is entirely possible that there's a black swan out there, OK? So what David Hume does is he negates induction. And what he argues is basically our understanding of the world is based primarily on custom. For him, custom just means consensus. We agree this is right, therefore it is right. There's no inherent truth to this thing, all right? So David Hume is very controversial because he argues that knowledge, true knowledge, is just impossible. which means that the entire project of philosophy is pointless. You know what you know through experience and for custom. You cannot abstract things, you cannot reason out things beyond that, and therefore, what's the point of philosophy? So that's David Hume. Now, what's going to happen is Emmanuel Codd is going to read David Hume and be so agonized over his conclusions that he writes call the critique of pure reason. And this is considered the greatest treatise of philosophy ever in human history. It's extremely dense, extremely complicated, and quite honestly I have not been able to complete it. I've tried my best, but it is way too difficult for me. So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to oversimplify his argument in order to make it clear for us, okay? He's so fundamental to development of human civilization that we need to study him, but I'm warning you that I am not in any way an expert on Kant, but I hope that today's class will become a basis for your further study and inquiry into Kant and philosophy, okay? All right, so in this critique of pure reason, what Kant's gonna do is he's going to show that all three schools of thought, rationalism, empiricism, and skepticism are all in their own way, problematic. And in doing so, he's gonna construct a new theory of everything, a new theory of the world that will become the cornerstone for neuroscience, physics, and artificial intelligence, okay? So his contribution to human civilization cannot be understated. All right, so for Kant, this rational school is problematic because he believes that omniscience is just not possible. It is impossible for us to ever achieve the mind of God. There are limitations to the pursuit of knowledge. There are limitations to our capacity to reason. So that's the first argument. Second argument is the empiricist argument of Tabula Rasa cannot possibly be true. He's gonna show us through a lot of empirical proof that it's not possible for minds to be black slaves. We need to have certain mechanisms of thought already in place for us to engage with the world. So that's the problem with the empiricists. His problem with Hume is he believes that there's knowledge that is real and inherent and true. And so knowledge can be pursued. Philosophy is important. In fact, for Kant philosophy is the most important pursuit in human history. So by responding to all three of these major schools, Kant, in his critique of pure reason, he's going to create a radical new theory of the world, his own unique epistemology based on the thinking of Dante. All right, so let's go into his argument very quickly. And again, this is an oversimplification. All right, so we are all endowed with the capacity to reason. We all have minds. And our minds engage reality. What concepts is this? The moment that we engage in reality, we create a new universe called parents. So let me first go over the terminology. It's very important you understand terminology in order to understand Kant. So for Kant, reality are things in themselves. And here he uses the Greek nominah, things in themselves. This is the world that is true and real. And then the word of appearance are what they call things for us. that we see, but which may not be true. And he uses the Greek word phenomena. And what he's arguing is within us, there is a mechanism in our minds that is always perceiving reality in a way that allows us to understand, interpret, and manipulate it. So this is his thesis. So let me first explain how he got to this thesis. So what Kant does is this. He reasons out, he tries to reason out what is possible in espionage, okay, in philosophy. And so what he does is he creates categories. So there are four major categories that we need to know. Okay, and again, this is a bit technical and complicated, but we need to do this in order before understanding Kant. So what Kant says is there are two types of knowledge. There's a priori and there's a prostrari. A priori is Latin for things that come before. A prostrari is Latin for things that come after. All right, so a priori means knowledge that is independent of experience. Things that are universal and necessary. Things that are true in themselves. And A per story, of course, are things that you learn after you experience it. Okay? He also has two more categories of logic. The first is called the analytical. The analytical, and then the second is called the synthetic. Okay, analytical just means things that are true in themselves, so they're true by definition. So if I say, for example, a square has four sides, a triangle has three sides. That's an analytical statement because it's true in itself. I can also say that A is A. I can also say that Mary is a woman. These are all just identity statements, things that are true in themselves. Synthetics, and so synthetic statements are statements that are not analytical, meaning that you need to build these statements based on other information, and they can be false. So just think of synthetic as non-analytic code. So what Kant does then it says, well then if there are two by two, there's four possibilities. And if you think about what apor is analytical is, that's just what logic is. This is just what's logical. Apor story, synthetic, is what we call empirical. This is the John Locke project, empiricism. Things that you know and learn after you experience it. A analytical APOR story just doesn't really matter, right? Because a square is four sides. It doesn't matter if you see a square of four sides. It doesn't really change anything. The main conflict between David Hume and Emmanuel Codd is whether or not apriori synthetic knowledge exists. For David Hume, he says this in his writings, it is impossible for apriori synthetic knowledge to exist. But what Emmanuel Codd will show us is it does exist. calls it transcendental idealism. Transcendental idealism. OK? And he's going to spend his entire book, A Critic of Pure Reason, about 1,000 pages, explaining why this must be true. Why is it that you must have a priori synthetic knowledge in your brain in order to understand the world? All right? So again, this is his main argument. And what he will show us is this. If you study mathematics, if you If you look at philosophy, if you look at classical physics, Newtonian physics, and you break things down to the most fundamental level, what you will discover is we have to bring incident assumptions into this field of knowledge for it to exist. And these two very basic things that we bring in are called space and time. Space and time. Space, if you just mean sensation, and time is sequence. Time is just an order of things, one, two, three, four, five. Space is just our inaction with the world around us. Unless we have these two basic concepts, no knowledge is possible, space and time. So this is really important, and this is a hard concept to understand. What Khan is saying is that space and time do not exist in reality. Space and time is a projection of our minds in order to, we can subsidize reality in a way that allows us to understand it and manipulate it, okay? Space and time. All right. In other words, okay, a very simple way to understand this is our minds turn the world into a story. Why? Because if you have space and time, you have causality, cause and effect. Time movement, right? So now you have causality. because all is just story. So what Khan is saying is we are just imagining reality into a story and that allows us to understand it. So what Khan's gonna do after he proves that space and time must exist a priority is he's not gonna explain how we take reality and we turn it into appearance. Okay? And what he's going to show us is that our mind has a process of doing this. And this process is three stages. There's apprehension, there's reproduction, and then there's recognition. So apprehension is just you're engaging the things in themselves and through space-time, okay? By inputting space-time into the things in themselves, you're able to reproduce it in your brain. you're able to create an image of it in your brain. And then what you're gonna do in order to understand it is to filter space time using something he calls categories. Okay, categories just think of it as our algorithm. A better word is heuristic, okay? Heuristic. Computers use algorithms, we use heuristics. All right, and there are 12 different categories, but There are four major categories. The first is quantity. How much of a thing it is? Quality. What are the properties of this thing? Relation. Is this thing logical or empirical? And then modality, which is what is the strength of the relation of this thing? I know it's complicated, but later on we we'll use some examples from real life to better understand how this works. All right, so and you don't really need to remember the categories. Just remember that what kind of saying is inherent in our mind is a heuristic, an algorithm that allows us to turn information into knowledge. All right, and when we do this, what happens is we create a schema, a representation of the world which allows for understanding the world. Okay, so for example, we see a lot of triangles, but We don't actually have an image of a triangle in our head. We only have a concept of a triangle in our heads. And this is true for a lot of things. So and then the schema then returns to the categories, which allows us to filter the world even more. So it is a feedback loop. So does this all make sense? This is concept perception of the world. And again, if you want to know the proof, if you want to know his logic, then you have to read the book for yourself, which It will take you about 10 years. Great. All right. So all this is saying is this is kind of reaffirming that Dante believed that the imagination is the animating force of the world. So about us, reality cannot be alive. It is our imagination that makes reality alive to us. Now this is from the critique of pure reason. He also wrote a book called The Critic of Practical Reason where he presents a theory of morality. So let's go over it. So for Kant, the highest ideal in morality is something called the categorical imperative. And this is separate and distinct from something called the hypothetical imperative. The hypothetical imperative is if you are a child in a school, how should you behave? This is specific. This is circumstantial. The categorical is the absolute. This is how you should always behave. And for Kant, there are three major principles that underlie all morality. So let's go over them one by one. The first is the idea of universal law. So Kant says, imagine that each of your action will be universalized, will be generalized, so that everyone will behave the way you do. So for example, you can choose to steal, But imagine everyone's stealing. Well, what kind of world would that be? You certainly would not want to live in that world, right? So behave as though everyone's watching you and everyone's going to do what you're going to do. Be the best possible example to everyone. So that's the first principle. Second principle is see humans each as an end onto itself and not as a means. Do not manipulate people, do not use people. Treat people with respect. And the third is the idea of autonomous will, which means that everything you do must be something that you reason out yourself. You're not coerced into it, you're not manipulated into doing it, you're not tricked into doing it. It's something that you, sitting by yourself in a room, you're able to reason it out independently. So this is the idea of the categorical imperative, which Kant believes is what we should all strive to and what we're capable of doing because we're capable of reason, we're capable of imagination, we're capable of imagining a moral world. And this is important because this becomes a basis for what we have today, the United Nations, human rights, international law. That's how influential Khan has been in development of human civilization. All right. So how can we understand the category imperative? So let's go back to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Remember, in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, he proposed the idea of the general will. The general will is not democracy. Democracy is simply you get everyone to vote. So in this room, I ask everyone, what should we have for lunch? And then someone proposes, let's have ice cream. And everyone raises his hand and says, yeah, let's have ice cream. That's democracy. But for Jean-Jacques Rousseau, what he argues is the general will is the best interest of people that you can derive from just by reaching out to yourself. So if you were all set down by yourself and asked, what should we have for lunch? It wouldn't be ice cream because ice cream makes you fat. It's too much sugar, it's bad for you. You would probably think we should have salad. So the general will represents the best interest of everyone involved. So if I would ask you what should we have for lunch, everyone would say, if we are following the general will, salad or maybe a chicken breast. So in other words, the categorical imperative, it is just the individualized general will. It's a general will that you internalize to yourself and you behave as though you are the general will. So that's a way of understanding the categorical imperative. Now there's another way of understanding the categorical imperative and just using Dante. So remember, we read the divine comedy. And Dante's cataclysm imperative is very simple. Love someone. Doesn't matter who. It could be your wife. It could be your mother. Or it could be your child. It could be your best friend. But love that person. And when you love that person, then all three things are true. It means you are now going to be your best. It means you are treating this person with respect. It means that you are choosing to love this person. So love is the unifying force of the universe. So that's what Dante is really saying. And so in other words, Kant, he is just systemizing what Dante said in the divine comedy. Does that make sense? All right, so for us to better understand Kant's argument, Kant's argument, I want to give you three examples to better understand what Kant is saying. The first example is imagine you are writing a diary. I want you to write a diary for a whole year. So every day you're writing what happened today. So you have 365 separate entries. So every day at night, I mean 9 p.m., just reflecting on what happened today. And then at the end of the year, what I want you to do is write one long diary entry. OK? Now, if you think about it, in theory, these separate entries should add up to equal this one long entry, right? But what you'll finally actually do this experiment is this long entry that you wrote almost has no relation at all with these 365 separate entries. Does that make sense? Right? OK? So in other words, what we're doing is constantly, every day we are reimagining the world in a new way. And we're building on top of this. So that's the first experiment. Another thing this is, all we're doing is we're taking discrete data points, which is what 365 diarrhea entries is doing, and then combine them into one complete story. Here's another experiment you can do, memory. So organize 100 classmates and go to a party and spend the whole day in a park. And organize the day so that everyone's doing the same thing. All right? Everyone's doing the same thing. And then next day, ask all 100 students to write down his experience of that one day. And I guarantee you every person will be different. Each person's experience will be unique onto himself, thus confirming what Khan said. The imagination is the animating force of the universe. So let's do one more experiment. And this is a thought experiment. There's something you can't do, but let's just imagine it. Imagine you end up on an island. And this island is very fertile, very opulent, lots of fruits, lots of fish. You don't have to worry about starving. But one day you go to sleep, and then your mind is wiped clean. becomes a tabular rasa as proposed by John Locke. So you have no more memory. You can't speak. You've lost the capacity of language. You've lost capacity to reason. You don't know where you are. You don't know who you are. You get up. And now the question then is, what will happen to you? Well, if you're John Locke, what's going to happen to you is you're going to start to death, because you don't know what to eat. You take a stone and you put it in your mouth. You take a leaf, you put it in your mouth. You don't know what to eat. You've lost all knowledge. But according to Kant, what Kant would say is, OK, sure, you've lost all knowledge. But because you have a priori synthetic knowledge, because you manipulate reality around you, because your mind is very good at filtering information, categorizing information, it'll take you a very short amount of time to figure out what is edible. You know stones, wood. That's a category of stuff you cannot eat. But then, you know, fruits, water, fish, is another category of things you can eat. All right, so, and I think just through pure intuition, we can figure out, you know what, Kant makes more intuitive sense than John Locke. Okay, so, does that make sense? So again, first experiment you can do and you will discover that if you do one long entry, They will not correlate these separate entries. The memory experiment you can also do. You can also do. The thought experiment you can't really do, but you can reason it out and discover it to be true. All right, so that is caught. A very short, simple introduction to caught. Any questions before I move on to Hegel? Yeah. Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah. Okay, so two great questions. The first question is, how did Kant perceive himself? And the second great question is how does science perceive him today? So a simple answer is Kant saw himself as a revolutionary thinker. He saw himself as Copernicus. He's going to fundamentally change the way that we perceive the universe. In fact, he calls it, what his critical period is, a Copernican revolution. I'll discuss this later on, okay? How Kant actually perceives himself. is Kant's ideas, I'll show you later on, is really the basis for modern day science. Einstein was heavily influenced by Kant. Einstein read Kant when he was 16, and because of Kant's theories of space-time and through a person's aesthetic knowledge, that gives him the theory of relativity. And if you study quantum mechanics, you will discover a lot of ideas were heavily influenced by Kant. So his influence on science is just incredible. And I'll discuss this when we are on, okay? All right, good. So now let's move on to Hegel. All right, so with Kant, his philosophy is, remember, we interact with the nomina, which gives us the phenomenon, the things that we can see, the appearance. There are three major issues that are unresolved in Kant. can't acknowledge these issues and it doesn't really provide a solution, okay? These three issues are this. The first issue of course is what is the nomenon? What are the things in themselves and concepts we can never know? Okay, that's the first major issue. Second issue is, okay, sorry but if our brains are capable of reason through a priori synthetic knowledge, where does not come from? What's the source for our mind? And the third problem is uniformity. If it is true that we are in fact always projecting onto nomenon, to create phenomenon, how do we know that we're all doing it the same way? How do we know that culturally, all cultures are doing the same way. Are you saying that the Egyptians, the Chinese, the Greeks, they all perceive the world in the same way? So these are the three major unresolved issues in Kant. Nomina, what is it? Kant says we can never know, right? Because we cannot imagine ourselves outside of space and time. What is the source for our minds? And Kant says we don't know, it's just there. And the third is uniformity. How do we know what we see is consistent with each other? And Kant says, we don't know, but we have to believe it. Otherwise, the world doesn't make any sense. How is it possible that without uniformity, you could have mathematics and science? But again, the problem with Kant is, this is not satisfying. So Hegel's gonna come along, and he's gonna provide a theory of everything. He's going to resolve these three issues for Kant, and create an entire system of thought that encompasses everything. So let's now move on to Hegel. So Hegel's major insight is, what if, as we're perceiving the nomanah, the nomanah is projecting back onto us. So it becomes a source for our ability to perceive the nomanah. So in other words, the nomanah is with the source, which creates the uniformity. All right? And so what is this Nomena? And the word that Hegel uses is geist, the geist, okay? And this is a German word that we translate into mine or spirit, okay? So Hegel's major work is called the themonology of the mine, which can also be translated into the themonology of the spirit. Okay, so translators argue about what the translation is. The problem is, mind and spirit don't really explain that much. So imagine Geis as, and this is a bad metaphor, but imagine Geis as the internet. And we are individual computers. We're always interacting with this internet. So that would give you a basic framework to understand what Geis is. It is a cut of consciousness, almost. But that's not accurate. To fully understand what Geist is, we need to go into the etymology of the word. What words were influenced English by Geist? And there are three words that were influenced by Geist. The first word is ghost. So ghost is the idea that the Geist is coexisting with us. The Geist is not separate from us, it is coexisting with us. It's here and now. Second word is geyser. Geyser and expansion are sprouting up. So the geyser is always growing. It wants to grow and expand. The third English word that comes from geyser is gist. The gist of an argument. The essence of an argument. So what Hegel is saying is the geyser is the essence of reality. The geyser comes first. It's a source for who we are. So again, to understand guys, think of it as an internet. But the internet that is coexisting with us, that is always expanding forward, and which is the essence of all life itself. That's why we say that Hegel is an idealist. He doesn't care about the material world. He doesn't think it really matters. What matters to him is the guys itself, the ideas. Because that's what drives human history. All right, okay, so let's talk about how he perceives the geyser. How does the geyser actually move? And for him, what matters are not the things. What matters is not the ideas. What matters is the movement of things. And so for Hegel, the main thing that moves is the dialectic, okay? And this is famous because obviously from the dialect, we have the thesis which moves into the antithesis, which moves into the synthesis. And this is the movement of human history. And the way to understand this is we all seek self-knowledge. But the way to seek self-knowledge is by asking who we are not, which creates the antiphasis. And then when we have the idea of who we are not, this comes in a conflict with who we are, which then creates new knowledge. OK? All right, so in order to understand this idea, let's do a thought experiment. Hey, the thought experiment is this. Okay, let's go back to the island and there's a hundred of us, okay? And we all sleep in different corners of the island. And again, during the night when we sleep, our minds are white clean. We're all now tabla rasa. We have no more memory, okay? We wake up and forget that there's other people there. We don't even know who we are. When we wake up, what we see is the universe, the space and time, and we think that we are the universe, that we are space and time, and there is a reconciliation between us and the world, okay, and we're really happy. But as we move along on the beach, we see someone else, and this other person threatens us because it's like us, but it's not like us. And now this person has destroyed my conception of the universe, which is like, I am the universe, or I am God. And this creates conflict, okay? We fight, we might actually physically fight, we might argue, okay? But over time, we create a synthesis, which is like, okay, the two of us are now the universe. Problem is, we walk along and we meet another person, another person, okay? So this is a constant process. But over time, even though there's conflict, even though it's violence, it's all a natural part of enlightenment. It's all part of the process of reconciliation where eventually all 100 of us, we rediscover who we are through conflict and differentiation and we form a kind of consciousness. We become what Hago says is the absolute spirit. Okay? Absolute spirit. And that is the progress and the purpose of our lives. All right, so let me frame it in a different way. So what Hegel was saying, okay? And again, these are not his words, these are my words, so be careful, okay? But I think this is the best way to explain what he's really saying about the movement of history. God has two forms. God is the Geist, okay? But God is also the universe. Does that make sense? Okay? So why would God do this? Why would God be both the universe and be the Geist? because God is trying to create reconciliation between itself and all the things in the universe. It's trying to come to peace, a reconciliation, an awareness between itself and us. So the guys through the dialect, it is growing and growing until it becomes the universe itself, and that is the end of history. And this is what we call a theological movement of history where things are moving towards their purpose. So what Hegel says is, the world is becoming. Do not think of the world as being but becoming, as constantly in a process or transformation of growth, of expansion. Why? Because it wants to become being. The being is when we are completely reconciled to God. That's the end of the world, that's the end of history. The reconciliation between us and God. When we become God and God become us, there's no more differentiation, there's no more conflict. We are moving towards this because the world is theological. Every single thing that we do is moving towards the one reunion with God. The guys, so to prove this, Hegel discusses the guys. How do we know the guys? Well, in culture we know the guys through, sorry, art, philosophy, and religion. And when you study these three things, historically what you will discover is they're all progressing, okay? So in terms of art, right now we are in the romantic period, which is the highest period of art because it is simplifying all previous periods of art. The highest religion is Christianity because it is the beginning of a reconciliation between us and God. Jesus was the great democratic force that allowed us to now all in our own way access God before God was captured and imprisoned by the priests. And Jesus freed God from the priests. And now, and so Christianity is the highest religion. And of course philosophy. What's the highest philosophy? Hegel, right? Because this theory of the guys is the endpoint of all our knowledge. From the guys, we can now finally reconcile, we can move towards reconciliation, okay? And so from this, there are some major influences, okay? So let's talk about the three major influences, legacies of Hegel. By far the most influential, of course, is the creation of Marxism. Because what Karl Marx will do is he will take this theory of Hegel, the movement of history, dialectic and he would create something called dialect materialism. He will invert Hegel because Hegel says it's only ideas that matter and what Marx will say is that nope only material things matter okay he will invert Hegel but he will also adopt a lot of Hegelian thinking okay so the dialectic becomes a very important part of Marxist theology sorry ideology which we'll study next class okay so that's the first major influence. Second major influence is in the idea of God is dead. So it was at Nietzsche actually who introduced this term. It was Hegel. And by God is dead, what Hegel is saying is we need to change our conception of God. Before we thought God was a loof, distant, and absolute. And now I'm presenting you a more advanced version of God, which is a God that is moving in towards itself. Okay? So God is that. And of course the third major influence which we will discuss later on is the idea of the nation-state. Because this fear of guise becomes part of the nation-state and so now because of Hegel we can believe that the nation-state can have a soul. Okay? And this will lead to a lot of problems which include imperialism, World War I and other really fun things, okay, but we cannot understate the influence of Hegel, all right? So that's Hegel, all right? So any questions before I move on to the legacy of Kant and Hegel? Was this clear? Was this clear? Good, good, good. with a great intellectual ability. Yep, yep, right. It seems to open for a guy to find out. Yeah, so that's a great point. Yeah, I mean how, I mean like, I mean Kant is very logical, Hegel is very abstract. So if you read the Quoting of Pure Reason, if you spend enough time on it, you will get through it, okay? You will be able to master it. Whereas if you try to read Hegel, especially the phenology of spirit, it's just impossible. It's like everyone who reads it will have like a different interpretation. And the reason why is what Hegel's trying to do, he's trying to synthesize all human knowledge. He's trying to take everything that's happened, everything that we know, and he's trying to synthesize it into a system which Kant just basically said, we can't really do. Okay. So, I mean, I'm not an expert on Hegel. And I don't want to be an expert on Hegel actually, because I think I will go crazy if I read too much Hegel. So, but I do know there's a lot of controversy around Hegel. He's actually regaining popularity in our, in our age, because of the idea of the guys, right? Because we live in a tube materialistic world. But yeah, sorry if I'm rambling on. Okay, all right, let's move on to the legacy, because the legacy will give us further insight into Cotton and Hegel as well as, help us better understand the world, okay? So Emmanuel Codd. So remember that Emmanuel Codd for him, he was really aware of what he was doing. And this argument was that the critical peer reason, it marks a radical new stage in human history. It is like Copernicus. Remember Copernicus, his major contribution was, before we thought we were at the center of the universe, right? And then Copernicus banished us from the margins of the universe. So it's a new way of perceiving the world. And so Kant's trying to do the same thing, okay? So pre-Khatt, the philosophers thought that there was an objective reality and that we were just observers of this objective reality. But through logic and experience, we could ultimately access this objective reality and concess, no, no, no. The world is entirely subjective. We project our imagination, our ideas onto the universe. We are active participants in the world. And this will give rise to the idea of remote-remedicism, okay? Which is that the human imagination is the highest ideal. It is, in many ways, it participates in God itself. So that is Kant's major revolution. This is Frederick Hegel, and let's really remind ourselves the difference between Kant and Hegel. So what Kant would say is, there are limits to reason. We can never know the mind of God. And where Hegel says is no, the mind of God is a dialectic. And therefore, we can know the mind of God. Cahn will say the world is what we will it to be meaning we have free will and Then hey will say we are moving towards the end of history Which we were progressing but this means we have no free will okay Everything has been planned from the beginning all these conflicts are part of a process of Eventual enlightenment and Cahn will say we must believe in God for morality to exist That's really important point. So Cahn is extremely logical He's very honest and he says there's nothing I can do to prove God exists. But we must believe God to exist, otherwise we have no morality in this world. He also says we must believe free will exists, even though there's no logical proof of free will, otherwise what's the point of existence? Hegel says God is dead. I've created a new God and it's a theological God that is forcing us towards him. So these are the three major differences between Kant and Hegel. All right, so now let's look at the legacy of Kant. So what's amazing is the more science progresses, the more Kant is proving right. So neuroscience is telling us today that we hallucinate the reality. And there are lots of experiments that prove this. So let's go over some really quick examples. We see a triangle, right? Guess what guys? It doesn't exist. It's just part of our imagination. These lines exist, the triangle doesn't exist. But the first one we see is this triangle that does not exist. This thing moves, okay? But we know it doesn't really move. So our mind is playing tricks on us. We see this as slanted. when we actually take them side by side together, you will see them as parallel. And another mind trick that's being played, which is bigger? Well, there's a thing. But because of the circles, we think this is bigger than that. Another mind trick that's being played on us. A and B are different colors, right? They see it as obvious they're different colors, right? But actually, they're the same color. Okay, another mind trick that's being played. So, neuroscientists have done all our experiments and they've proven to us that we constantly participate in reality, we hallucinate reality, which is what Kant originally proposed. All right, let's move on to artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence shows us the limits of the blank slate theory. So, let's imagine you actually had a blank slate in your minds. Well, that would be extremely problematic And we know because of how artificial intelligence works. All right, let's look at supervised learning. So we talk about artificial intelligence, it doesn't actually exist. What exists is the idea of supervised learning. And the idea is this. We're trying to teach a machine, an algorithm, to recognize a picture. Okay, so what we do is this. We feed a lot of training data into the algorithm. And we're talking like millions and millions of pictures. And then we label this data so that the machine is able to using its own analysis figure out the differences. It basically turns every picture into a mathematical concept. And then if you train it well enough, then it's able to differentiate between a triangle and a circle. That's the idea of machine learning. Same concept here. You have to feed it millions of pictures And you have to label these different pictures. And then the machine will mathematically be able to figure out which is which. How the machine does that, we're not really concerned about. But we need to train the machine. And the problem with this is it's a very expensive, it's a very time consuming. Now let's compare this with how a human does it. A human, if I just give you a picture of a sheep, you're able to know what a sheep is. And why does that happen? Okay, so a machine is able to tell you this is sheep, okay? But what a machine is not able to tell you is, is this sheep real or fake? Is this a real or fake sheep? Well, we think it's fake, right? But what the machine says, we don't know. And the machine is correct. Real, fake are categories of a mind, right? What, how do we know this is a fake sheep and not a real sheep? Do you understand? So the machine is saying, you know, if I don't know anything, if I have no, a parasympathetic knowledge, then I can have differentiate between fake and real. But a child, anyone can know this is a fake sheep, because obviously we have categories in our minds, okay? A machine could not tell you what this is. Why? Because this has become a schema, a concept. But any child can tell you this is a sheep, okay? And again, so this is artificial intelligence is showing us that Kant was correct. All right, as I mentioned, Kant inspired Einstein to dream up the theory of relativity. All right, so Einstein read Kant when he was 16 and had a huge influence on Einstein. Space-time curvature is influenced by it, but also the theory of relativity, okay? And the theory of relativity, it's fairly straightforward. Let's just say that I'm sitting on a platform, a train platform, and you guys are across from me, okay? Now, we're not moving, right? We know we're not moving. But let's just say that for a reason, simultaneously, both platforms are moving at the same speed. From our perspective, we're still not moving. And that's the idea of relativity, where the laws of physics are relative to where we are at the moment. And this again is influenced by, What's really fun is to think about quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics confirms things in themselves no matter how are not knowable to us. So this is a major argument between Khan and Hegel. And so quantum mechanics, so we looked at light. We want to know what the essence of light is. What are photons? And we discovered something really problematic, which is we discovered that photons are both wave-like and particle-like. They're both wave movement and particle, something static. And what's even more problematic is what we discovered is you're not able to figure out the state of the light if it's a wave or a particle until you actually measure it. So in other words, before you measure light, before you measure particles, they are simultaneously occupying many different possibilities. Something we call a superposition. And this idea of wave function. The way function is all the probabilities of its position in space. When you measure it, it collapses into one data point. Does that make sense? All right. So in school, we teach you the Bohr model of the atom. But really, it's a cloud, meaning we don't know where the electrons are at a certain state. We can only know the probability of where it could be. And so that's the problem here. All right. So this idea of quantum mechanics, Einstein hated this theory. He thought this was disgusting, there's too much randomness, it's ugly, he hated it, okay? He thought that God as an architect had an elegant mind. And we come up with these theories like quantum mechanics which actually makes absolutely no sense, you're insulting God. So to disprove quantum mechanics, Einstein wrote a paper on something called quantum entanglement. The idea is this, things cannot be measured. Sorry, things, we cannot know the set of things of atoms until they are measured, right? Well, in quantum mechanics, things also exist in opposition towards each other. So maybe two atoms are aligned together and they have two states or mirror images of each other. So what you can do is this, and you split these two and you set them off in different corners of the universe. According to quantum mechanics, the moment you measure the first atom, the second atom must also reveal itself even though you have not measured it. And it also has to be simultaneous, even though these two atoms could possibly at different ends of the universe, quantum entanglement. And Einstein says, this can't possibly be true. This is a stupid idea. And this proves quantum mechanics doesn't work. The problem is this. The problem is we've done experiments to prove quantum entanglement actually does work. And this is true. Not only that, but quantum mechanics has proven itself to be the most successful theory in physics of all time. Because it's given a rise to the transistor. The idea of the transistor is if you don't understand electrons, then you can manipulate electrons in a way that allows you to manipulate it, which allows you to make calculations on it. So the transition has given a rise to the computer, which has given a rise to the internet. Basically, create the world that we live in today. So by quantum mechanics, we cannot have the world we live in today. Okay, so, but again, even though we know quantum mechanics to be true, we don't know why it's true. Okay, there's lots of mysteries in quantum mechanics. One of the biggest problems in quantum mechanics is something called Schrodinger's cat. So Schrodinger created a thought experiment to show you how problematic quantum mechanics is. I just say that you have a cat inside a box, and there's radioactive material inside this box. And you don't know, you can never know if this cat is dead or alive. So the only thing you can say is, it is both dead and alive, which again is problematic. But that's not it. It's been more problematic, because another physicist, Wigner said, okay, let's do another experiment. Let's just say, okay, I'm a scientist. I open the box. Then I know the state of the cat now, right? I didn't know it before. Once I open the box, I can see the cat is alive or dead. Now I know. But let's just say that there's a friend in my laboratory who is observing me, okay? And he has not himself opened the box. So when I open the box and I find the cat is dead, what happens to him? Okay? Well, there are different possibilities. The first possibility is, he now knows. So reality has changed for him once he has this information. The other possibility is he doesn't know, but he thinks he knows. So this shows you how problematic quantum mechanics is. And you can keep on going like this to the nth degree. In other words, the question that they're trying to deal with, the question that quantum mechanics doesn't really able to resolve is, is reality subjective or objective? Can there be a one reality in which we all live in or is reality constantly multiplying subjectively? In other words, whenever we make a decision, whenever we make, whenever we act, it changes reality for us, but not for others. Is it possible like we all live in our own universe That is unique to us. That's the question quantum mechanics cannot answer. And it creates a huge problem in quantum mechanics. But if we go back to Kant, well, the answer's obvious. It is true that we do create our own individual reality. The norm went out. It's something we can never see. This is quantum mechanics. The mind, when it interfaces with the thing itself, it creates the world that we live in. So this brings back to the point that the imagination is the enemy force of the universe. When we use the imagination, we create our own reality that is distinct from other realities. So does that make sense? Okay, so, okay. Another way of framing this is, what is happening here? Is Kant describing the world we live in or did he create this reality that we live in? Okay, and so another saying that's saying that is rather than artificial intelligence, neuroscience, quantum mechanics, all confirming what Kant first argued. Another saying of saying this is Kant gave them the intellectual capacity come up with these theories by themselves. Okay, another saying of saying this is this. Philosophy creates the boundaries of the human imagination. And science, all science is doing is playing with these boundaries to confirm what is known within these boundaries. That's the radical statement that I want you to think about. Is science capable of coming up with new ideas by itself? And the argument I would make is no. Because you can have data. What matters is your interpretation of this data. And this interpretation of data comes from the geist. the collective mind that philosophers like Kant and Hegel created. This is problematic because we live in a world today that is undervaluing philosophy and arts, and overvaluing STEM, engineering, technology. So my argument to you is, if that is the case, if we just spend all money on science, it's all going to be useless. Because in the Dante world view, Dante talks to God, writes the Divine Comedy. Divine Comedy then inspires Kant to write the Critique of Pure Reason, which inspires Hegel and the two together will go inspire neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and quantum mechanics. So in other words, it is an imagination that creates all reality, not just our individual reality. There are some of us who are geniuses, who are able to imagine a new reality in which we can now inhabit and participate in. Evidence for this is, you know, ever since the Germans, so Kant also conceptualized the United Nations, Ever since Kahnensberg fell, ever since the Germans lost World War II, we have not made major advances in science. Okay, remember the transition is not a major advance, it's just a, it's just a, it's just technology, it's just taking the science and then expressing it in, in the world that we live in today, okay? So without culture, without the guys, is it possible to contribute, to advance science, okay? And I think the answer is no. I think we're stuck where we are because we've abandoned culture, we've abandoned the guys. So Emmanuel Kant was a citizen of Connorsburg. In fact, he was called the Connorsburg clock. Why? Because he was so regimented. He made sure at a very specific time, he would take a walk somewhere, okay? And so by observing where he was at a certain time, the residents of Connorsburg we know what time it is. So you can make the argument that Kant created Connorsburg, because Connorsburg would, after Kant, become the inter-electro-scientific center of Europe. But Connorsburg also created him, which is an idea which would be very familiar to Hegel. So that is it for Kant. we will now move on to Marx and Freud, okay? But was this clear? Any questions? Okay, great. So next class we will do Marx."}
{"video_id": "_blj8zKdKgA", "title": "Geo-Strategy #3:  How Empire is Destroying America", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_blj8zKdKgA", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 2861.0203125, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 5748, "text": "So in this class, this semester, I'm making three big predictions, right? First is that Trump will win in November. Second is that United States will go to war against Iran. And the third big prediction is that United States will lose this war, which will forever change the global order. So last class, we looked at one reason why the United States would invade Iran, which is the Israel lobby. And in today's class, we'll look at another reason, which is the defense of empire. America is an empire, and it must defend its imperial status. So let's examine what an empire means for America. So from 1950 to 1980, America's economy was mainly focused on manufacturing, factories. So manufacturing as a share of GDP was 40%. It made 40% of profits and employed 30% of the workforce. So during World War II, America had a lot of factories produce weapons. And after World War II, these factories produced consumer goods, cars, electronics to sell to the world. And this made the American workers the wealthiest and most educated middle class ever in human history. If you were a factory worker from 1950 to 1980, You had a really good life. You worked 40 hours a week. You had health insurance. You could buy your own house. Your wife didn't have to work. You could have three to four kids. You could have two cars. Every year, you could go on vacation to some place nice. You could eat out once a week. And then you retire and have a very good pension. So it was really the best life. And so workers from 1950 and 1980 in America were really the luckiest people on the planet. You were better off actually being born into the middle class in America than you were being born rich in Africa or Asia or South America, okay? But then after 1980, was something called the Reagan Revolution And the introduction of what we call neoliberalism. And remember that we studied neoliberalism before. Neoliberalism is an academic philosophy that believes in the primacy of free markets and deregulation. So after that, we now live in today what we call a financial economy. The economy has been financialized. And so what does that mean? It means that right now financial services account for 22% of all GDP in America. Manufacturing has gone down to 10%. So went down from a higher 40% to now a low of 10%. Financial services is now twice as much as manufacturing. Financial services bring in 40% of all profits and financial services employs 5% of the total American workforce. Okay? Now, let me explain what these numbers mean. What you're seeing behind these numbers is a radical shift, overhaul, transition in American society. Okay, let's just look at politics, politics, governance. From this period, 1950, 1980, American workers had a lot of local power, right? Because they were middle class, they were confident, they participated in politics for unions, okay? Today, most of this power has shifted to the financial services, which basically means Wall Street. And working for Wall Street are what we called the professional managerial elite. Okay, so these are people who live on the coast, San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., Boston. They went to elite schools, okay, the Ivy League, and they're multicultural. And right now they're the most powerful political group in America. And this has led to massive political divisions within the country, okay? So it's the first major consequence. Before it was workers who had a large say over American politics. And now it is Wall Street, the financial sector, and the coastal professional management elite. And so government shapes policies that favors this multicultural elite, financial elite, over at the expense of workers, okay? So that's the first major shift. But then you look at education. And so what I mean by that is that, if you went to a good school, a good university, in the 1950s and 1960s, your ambition was to become a professor, right? Or maybe a scientist. or maybe an entrepreneur or corporate executive. Nowadays, most people who graduate from these top schools all wanna go where? Wall Street, and that's it. Why? Because you make more money on Wall Street than anywhere else. So you're talking about these PhDs in statistics and artificial intelligence who should be working for IBM, developing the latest technology, right? Instead, they're on Wall Street working for a hedge fund gambling with other people's money. Okay, so basically the economy has gone from one that is productive or creative to one that is entirely speculative. Okay, so remember that financial services, all it does is take people's money and gamble with it or investing it to make more money. It's not actually productive. It's all it is speculative. And the smartest people in America, the most well-educated, are all focused on the sector. And then you look at the economy. And what has clearly changed is that the economy in America has become much more unstable. So in 2001, there was the internet crash, right? The dot-com crash. And in 2008, there was the financial crisis, right? The sub-crime crash. And then after that, you have all the, you have these banks going bankrupt, okay? I think like this past week, three banks went bankrupt in America. This should not be happening. And the reason why this is happening are all these bubbles. OK? So in other words, all assets right now in America overpriced. OK? Housing, stock market. And people are gambling that these asset prices will go higher, which creates bubbles. And when these bubbles burst, you have volatility and instability and uncertainty. OK? So this is bad for the economy. And then you have things like inequality, right? So if you look at profits, if you look at wealth generation, the top 1% make much more money than everyone else. And this inequality is only increasing, okay? So in other words, the financialization of the American economy has been really bad for America. And you can make the argument that it's actually destroying the fabric of American society. It's making politics much more divisive. It's making the economy much more volatile. The smartest people are engaged in speculative activities. Young people don't want to work. They just want to buy Bitcoin. And you can also make the argument that you're creating a rentier economy. And the rent to your economy just means that if you are young, you can never afford to buy a house. You can only rent, which means that you yourself can never go from, you have no more social mobility. So this overall is really bad for America. Another question then is, how did America get to this point? How did it transition from a manufacturing economy to a financial economy? And there are different theories out there, okay? There are some economists who say that this is just late-stage capitalism, okay? This is the natural evolution of capitalism. There are some who argue that it is the neoliberalism or the regular revolution that calls this, okay? When you take government, when you cut back the role of government, when you emphasize free markets, then you have this situation, the overfinancialization of the economy, okay? What I want to show you today is that the real reason is the transition to empire, okay? There's a really simple explanation for why this is happening. And the reason is that after the end of the Cold War, 1991, America became a global empire. It could now set the rules of the game. And it set the rules of the game so that it would always win. And then all money flowed to America, which created all these acid bubbles. So that's the argument I'm making to you today, okay? So are we clear about what's happening? Any questions so far? Okay, now I wanna explain to you how America became an empire. In fact, the most powerful empire in human history because even though Rome was powerful, it didn't really control the world. Whereas America, the American empire today controls the entire world, okay? And so to understand how America became an empire, you have to go back to the founding of America. So in 1776, America declared independence from Britain. And at that time, they had something called the Declaration of Independence. And the Declaration of Independence, if you read the document, it's very clear. What the founding fathers of America said is that, we are founding a new society in America based on God. Now, the founding fathers were Christians, but there was a special type of Christians who believed in the idea of deism. And deism is the idea that, yes, there is a God, and God, they create everything, but God is not interested in managing human affairs. God leaves us alone, which means that we as humans are empowered To create the world we want to create. The founding fathers wanted to create a new society based on the idea of God. What they believed is that God gave human beings three fundamental rights that all governments must respect. The famous phrase is, do you guys know the famous phrase? Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is the mission, the purpose of America, to ensure that every American would have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that's really the goal, the role of government. life to make you safe, okay, to provide security against enemies, liberty. The right to say whatever you believe, the right to believe whatever you believe, okay? So the tolerance of all creeds, religions. Now last is the pursuit of happiness. What does pursuit of happiness mean? You guys know? So Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and when he wrote the pursuit of happiness, he had a very specific idea in mind. What does the pursuit of happiness mean? Which is what? So wealth, OK? So in America, your fundamental right, the fundamental purpose of your life is to make as much money as you can, to amass as much wealth as you can. And the idea here is that in this society, in this new society, there's an experiment called America. If we allow everyone to pursue the creation of wealth, then America will become powerful. That's the idea. And it turned out that this idea was absolutely correct. In a very short amount of time, America industrialized very rapidly. And at the end of World War II, America became the most powerful country in the world. After World War II, it decided that it can now export its philosophy to the rest of the world. So in 1944, there's something called the Bretton Woods Conference. So in 1944, everyone knew that Nazi Germany would be defeated, and Japan would be defeated, which would make America the most powerful, the richest nation on the planet, okay? Now the Soviet Union was a competitor, but they didn't really matter, okay? They had their own sphere of influence. So America got together with its allies in Europe and they decided what the new global financial system would look like. And the idea was that with Brendan Woods, they decided that the US dollar would become the global reserve currency, which basically meant that you could buy anything with the US dollar. Now, there are some people at Bretton Woods, some economists who were afraid that this would cause problems, right? If you have a government which was in control of the global reserve currency, that would basically make the government God, right? If they could just print as much money as they wanted, they could become like Midas. If they touch something, it'll become gold. So some people thought it was dangerous. And so the compromise is that the US dollar had to be backed by gold, the gold standard. In other words, the US dollar was basically like a receipt for gold. If you had a million dollars, you could go to any American bank and get a million dollars worth of gold for it. Does that make sense? So that's what we call the gold standard. And for the longest, and so that led, this Britain-Witch system led to tremendous prosperity in America and in Europe and in Japan. Then in 1971, Richard Nixon did something really radical. He basically said, we America, we're gonna go off the gold standard. Remember that America had spent too much money on the space race, on Vietnam, on domestic expenses, okay? So they needed to transition out of the gold standard. But if you transition out of the gold standard, then how do you ensure the US dollar is worth something? How do you ensure the intricate worth of the US dollar? So they transition from the gold standard to what? Do you guys know? Oil, okay? Do you understand? petro dollar. The idea here is that look, every economy needs oil to to run, right? You need oil as the basis of your economy. And so after America went off the gold standard, these countries in the Middle East, meaning Saudi Arabia, but other countries as well, agreed that you could buy oil using US dollars. So the The idea is, okay, before if you had a million dollars, a million US dollars, you could change, convert that to gold, okay? And now you can convert it to oil. And this is what we call the petrodollar. And this is really the basis for the value of the US dollar today, okay? So then what happened is that in 1991, the Soviet Union fell, And now America was in charge of the entire global economy, basically. And so America, at that time, said to everyone, listen, let's focus on trade, because trade will make everyone rich. So let me explain the theory of this. So America basically wanted everyone to trade. And the idea of trade, this is like Russia, China, South America. The idea of trade is that each country would focus on its competitive advantage. What are you good at? And then you would sell this competitive advantage to other countries for what they're good at, okay? And the theory here is that if you do it this way, then all countries will become rich, okay? So let me explain why. All right, so let's look at US and China, okay? So what China is really good at is cheap labor. United States, what the United States is really good at is technology, right? Okay, so the idea is that the United States is trying to trade, right? So China makes all these cheap goods for American consumers. But unfortunately, Chinese consumers don't have enough purchasing power to buy American technology, right? Okay? So what happens is that America gives China US dollars instead. OK, trillions and trillions of US dollars. Now in theory, what's supposed to happen is this money trickles down to the average Chinese so that the average Chinese worker, his wages go up. And when his wages go up, what he can do now is by US products, like iPhones. And so over time, trade evens out. Does that make sense? That's a theory. That's a first theory. The second theory is how capital moves. And the idea here is that capital is going to go to places which allows it to grow the most. And so the idea is that when you have a globalized world, Then what happens is capital from United States moves to China, right? Because if you invest in China, your capital grows the most. You can buy a million dollar house in United States, or you can buy 10 houses for the same money in China. So you're better off buying houses in China, right? Okay, so these are the two theories. One is that trade will make everyone rich. And second is that capital will move from rich countries to poor countries, okay? And when you actually go to university and you study economics, like Jack Wol, then you actually have to learn these theories. But in reality, these two theories aren't true. Okay? Why not? Why aren't these two theories true? So the first theory is that if two countries trade Over time wealth trickles down to everyone in that country, which makes everyone richer. Is that true for China? No, it's not, okay? Workers' wages have not gone up for the past 30, 40 years. Why? Because of the idea of elite capture. Elite capture. So all the money is captured by an elite group of people. But when that happens, okay, they can't spend it. They can't buy US goods. So the only thing they can do is invest it. Now according to this theory, they should invest it back in China because if you investment in China should allow for more growth than investment in Wales. But in reality, where do they put their money? In the United States. And why would they do that? Why? Exactly. You don't put your money where you make the most money. you put your money where it's the most safe, okay? That's where we have banks. So because the United States controls the US dollar and because people's wealth is expressing US dollars, it makes the most sense to put your money in the United States. And this is not just true for China, it's true for most countries in the world. And that's why starting in the 90s, You have all this wealth amassing in the United States. Okay, does that make sense? So everything in the United States became overpriced. Everything became a speculative bubble. Okay, so let me give you an example. Let's look at equities, okay, start market, stocks. In the year 1900, okay, in the year 1900, if you look at all the stock markets, the largest was the UK, okay, because obviously the UK is the most powerful country in the world was the most powerful country at that time. Sorry, at that time, the UK was the most powerful country. So in a stark market, as a percentage of the entire global stock market was about 25%, 24 to 25%. The United States was second at 14.5%. And you had Germany, about 13% friends at 11%. So that was the situation of wealth in the year 1900. And this makes sense, right? These four countries are industrially extremely powerful. Today, OK? Today, the year 2024, the United States has 60% of all the world's stock wealth. Okay? Who's second? Can you guys guess? Who'd be second? Japan, okay? And what is the percentage of global stock wealth? Can you guys guess a number? United States has 66%, 60%. How much does Japan have? Can you guess a number? 10% is a good guess, right? It's actually 6%, okay? You see the disparity. Number one is 60%. Japan, number two, it's 6%. It's huge disparity. How much is China? The world's second largest economy, 3%. You understand? So all this wealth that's being generated around the world, it can only end up one place, the United States. So you have, and that's what's pushed the financialization of the US economy, okay? Because this wealth goes to United States and someone has to manage this wealth. And this is the financial services sector, okay? So people on Wall Street, and this is very important, people on Wall Street, they make their money based on how they manage this wealth, not on whether or not they make money out of this money. You understand? They charge a management fee, okay? So in other words, they're not actually incentivized to be conservative and make sure that this money grows. What they're incentivized to do is design riskier and riskier assets and investment opportunities to attract more investment because then they can take a managed fee, a cut. It doesn't make sense. And that's what's led to so much financial over-speculation over the past 20 years in America. And one of America's biggest problems is the growing national debt, okay? So the government is paying for a lot of government services just by putting money, okay? So right now, the US national debt is about $34 trillion. And there's $34 trillion debt. Half of it is owned by foreigners. Okay, so Japan has about a trillion. China has about 800 billion. So they buy US Treasuries. Okay, so America owes Japan $12. America owes China $800 billion. And then half of it, the government owes to its people. So the two largest expenses are the military and the pension system. Okay? So $34 trillion is a lot of money because the US GDP is about $100 trillion. So the total debt is about a third of America GDP. And this debt has interest, right? So this debt is going about $1 to $2 trillion every two to three months. Okay. And all this is saying, okay, these numbers, all they're telling us is there's absolutely no way that America can pay all this debt. Okay. So then the question then is if you're China and you're, you're, you're Japan, why do you have all this debt knowing that America can never pay you back? Or America, what's on point default on this debt? Why? Why does America, why does Japan and China and other countries have all this debt, US Treasury's knowing fully knowing that America can never really pay back all this debt. Why? Okay, so there are many reasons. Okay. The first reason is that in theory, Japan and China can always take this debt and buy oil with it. Okay. So this is again the petro dollar. Second reason is that even though America is in debt, it's still an empire. It's still the greatest military power in the world. So at some point, you feel that the money is safe there. Does that make sense? Because no one can actually challenge America militarily. And the third reason, and this is the most important reason is, there's no place for you to go. You understand? What else can you put your money? Nowhere. So that's the issue right now. And so in theory, because China and Japan can buy oil with it, and because there's really no place for China and Japan to put this money, in theory this system can go on forever. Okay? So it's possible that maybe in ten years time that will be 340 trillion. Okay? Who knows? Okay? So in theory, this could go on forever, right? Because America is an empire. But then what happened two or three years ago is Russia invaded Ukraine, okay? Russia invaded Ukraine. And why this is important is that this is basically Russia challenging the dominance of the American empire, okay? What Putin is really saying to the United States is, I think your empire is full of lies. Your empire is based on nothing. Your empire is based on the perception that you are invincible in war. Well, I'm gonna invade Ukraine and prove everyone wrong, okay? I'm gonna show that you, America, are in fact a paper tiger, okay? And so if Putin succeeds in his war in Ukraine, then the fundamental understanding of how the world works, that America is an empire, that America is invincible, that the US dollar is safe, will radically change. It will be destroyed, it will be undermined, it will be subverted, okay? Does that make sense? So that's why America needs to stop Russia in Ukraine. Can it stop Russia in Ukraine? How's the war going for America and Ukraine? Pretty badly, okay? I mean, the war's almost over. Okay, so, but what America can do, okay, which will solve all these problems, is for America to transition from a financial economy back to a manufacturing economy, okay? If America just does this, America has nothing to worry about. It doesn't have to worry about the debt, Does it have to worry about Russia? It doesn't really have to worry about the world, okay? Because America is a self-sufficient economy, meaning that it has the resources to sustain itself. It doesn't really need to trade with the rest of the world. If America can return to being a manufacturing economy, then it will be invincible. Okay? Now the question then is, can America re-industrialize? Yes or no? Why not Jack? Because the politics doesn't allow them to exactly, but can you explain that? That's exactly right Jack, okay? So yes, the problem right now is the very structure of American society and politics and economy. Right now the financial sector has all the power. And they don't wanna go back to the time when manufacturing had all the power, right? So that's the first problem. But let's just say for the sake of argument that they agree to this, okay? What's your other problem if you want to be reindustrialized? Excuse me? OK. But all the foreign investment can just go into factories, right? But there's actually a really big problem with reindustrialization, OK? So as Jack says, there will be political resistance to this. But then you have a bigger problem than this, which is what? OK, guys. The problem with this economy is it creates a speculative mindset, OK? So therefore, no one wants to work hard. No one wants to go to work in factories anymore. Do you understand? If you're a young person, you would much rather spend your time investing in Bitcoin than working in a factory. Do you understand? Because investing in Bitcoin gives you the opportunity to become rich. But if you work in a factory, you have to work hard for 40 years just to buy a house. Does that make sense? So you're not gonna find people to work these factories. That's a bigger problem, okay? And the third problem, of course, is just investment. How do you build these factories? You not only have to build these factories, but you also have to build logistics networks to move goods from one place to the next, okay? Okay? So in other words, America could re-industrialize, but it's a pain in the ass, right? You're gonna face a lot of political opposition, especially from the financial sector. It's very hard for you to get people to work in factories. And plus, where's all this money gonna come from? So, if you can't beat Russia in Ukraine, and if you can't re-industrialize, then what can you do to protect the petro dollar and your financial system? Well, I have an idea, okay? Invade Iran, okay? invaded Iran. Now why would you do that? And the answer is that unfortunately of all the options out there, okay, because America can't just sit back and let its empire collapse, right? Of all the options out there, invading Iran happens to be politically the easiest to do, okay? You can't go fight a war against Russia because Russia has nuclear weapons. You cannot re-industrialize because there'll be too much political opposition towards that. Plus it'll take you about 50 years to re-industrialize. But if you invade Iran, well, you accomplish three things. The first thing is you show the world that you're still the top dog. Your military is still invincible. So if you're a foreign investor in America, you have $200 in the US, you feel safe. You don't think the US dollar will collapse. That's the first thing, to show the world that America is still the world's foremost military power. Therefore, the US dollar is safe. Second is oil, right? What is the US dollar based on? Oil, right? Well, if you control oil, then you don't have to worry about people abandoning the US dollar. Does that make sense? And it happens that the Middle East produces 40% of the world's oil. And Iran is the world's fourth largest oil exporter. But when you take over Iran, you also control Iraq as well. You control that entire area. And the third thing about invading Iran is trade. So that area, most of the world's trade has to pass through that area, right? So, invading Iran would allow you to control the world's shipping lanes, okay? So that would be the theory behind evading Iran, okay? But the motivation would be to save the American empire the American Empire because if Putin wins in Ukraine then America is going to look weak. It's gonna look like a paper tiger. Okay? And in this situation as the Empire you have to act. Today you have a lot of countries in Africa who are rebelling against the Western powers, France basically, and in America. Why? Why? Because they think that Putin is now in charge. Why did October 7th, why did Hamas attack Israel? I guarantee you that if it were not for the war in Ukraine, Hamas would not have done such a thing. For the longest time before the war in Ukraine, there was a perception in the world that America was militarily invincible. No power, no country could ever dare stand up against the United States. And by invading Ukraine, Putin has proved everyone wrong. That the United States can be defeated. And so what the United States must do now is prove to the world, nope, we're still militarily the greatest power in the world. Does that make sense? And again, it must do so to protect its financial economy. Otherwise, there's a very good chance that this financial economy will implode onto itself. If China, Japan, other countries pull out of the US financial sector, if they sell the US treasuries, not only will America face a sovereign debt crisis, but it will lose access to easy money. And the problem in America today is that America is an empire addicted to easy money. People are so used to dishing around and making millions of dollars that they cannot imagine or tolerate a day when they would have to go back to working hard. So it's this addiction to easy money which will drive American which will drive America to invade Iran. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, any questions? Okay, so all this money coming to America, how's it managed? Okay, so this is actually very complicated, okay? Because again, the financial sector is very large. But if you have, you're a starler, then your options are, you can invest in the stock market, you can invest in houses, okay? The problem today is because there are too many rich people in the world, and all this money is going to America, all assets are bubbles now. So the irony of all this is that you feel that your only option is to invest in America, but when you do this, you're actually losing value. And that's why this system is not really sustainable. Everyone's going to America and that's showing up all these asset prices, but in the long term that will destroy the American economy. In the long term, it will create all these bubbles that will also destroy individual wealth. Does that make sense? Any more questions? So Jack asks a great question, which is like, listen, if going to Iran is all about restoring confidence in the United States. Well, if America loses the war, then that would destroy even more confidence. And so this is the problem of empires. Empires have something called hubris, imperial hubris, which means that they cannot imagine the possibility of losing a war. So why is that? There are two reasons. There are two reasons. The first reason is that an empire, what an empire is, it's a force that imposes reality onto others, okay? An empire makes you see the world the way the empire wants you to see the world. Okay, does that make sense? Which means there's no feedback loop. Which means that you cannot actually tell the empire what you think. Your voice doesn't matter. Which means that an empire, it's not possible for an empire to imagine possibility of it ever collapsing. You understand? If it could, it would never collapse. That's the first problem. Second problem is that, okay, let's do a thought experiment. If you had a choice, if you had a choice, would you rather be smart and strategic or stupid and arrogant? If you had a choice in an ideal world, would you rather be smart and strategic or stupid and arrogant? The answer is stupid and arrogant because it makes you feel good, okay? Stupid people feel good about themselves, right? Smart people get depressed, they doubt themselves, they question themselves, and that makes you feel bad. Most people in an ideal world would want to feel good about themselves always, okay? So when you are an empire, you want to be stupid and arrogant because it makes you feel good. Does that make sense? Okay? But that's why empires collapsed because once they have too much power, they become stupid and arrogant and they refuse to consider the possibility that they could be wrong. Okay. Does that make sense, Jack? Okay. Any more questions? Okay. Uh, the American empire has been building for a long time. Okay. So you can make the argument that the empire really started after a World War two, because now America controlled half the world. And then it became dominant after the, after the end of the cold war, when the Soviet Union collapsed. And at that time, before the collapse of the Cold War, America had to behave itself. And the reason it had to behave itself was it wasn't afraid of sort of a union, it was afraid of communism, right? That's why from 1950 to 1980, they treat their workers so well, because they were afraid of a worker revolt, right? So the real threat was not sort of a union, the real threat was communism as an opposing ideology to capitalism. Unfortunately today, there's no opposing ideology towards capitalism, okay? And that's why America can do what it wants. It does not fear any enemies, it does not fear internal revolt. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, all right, so I'll see you guys next week."}

Today, this morning, we are doing the Byzantine Empire, and I will be looking at three questions. The first question is, why do we have the Byzantine Empire? Historically, we have seen the Byzantine Empire as a continuation of the Roman Empire. We have the Byzantine Empire because Constantine the Great in 330 transfer the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Byzantium, which later became which which he called New Rome and which eventually was renamed to Constantinople. So why did he make that transition? Okay that's the first question. Second question is how did the Byzantine Empire rise? It fell, it lasted from 330 until 1453 when the Ottoman Turks overran the capital of Constantinople. So it lasted for over a thousand years. Arguably it is the most enduring world empire in human history. So how was it so successful? That's a second question. Now the third and last question is why did it ultimately decline? Why did it collapse? What were the factors that led to its eventual demise. Okay, so those are the three questions we will be looking at this morning. And I wanna do, first I wanna present the scholarly consensus. What is generally accepted? What is generally believed about these three questions? And then I wanna present my own perspective in order to refute this scholarly consensus. All right, so let's start. This is the Roman Empire in 117 and as you can see it is huge. It spans across the Mediterranean. This is Spain, over here is Anatolia, Egypt, and Lovat. So it is a huge world empire and that's a problem. It's just much too big. Unlike China, it has no natural boundaries. And throughout most of its history, it was invaded by barbarians, what the Romans call barbarians, basically these Germanic Gothic tribes from the north. It also had a major adversary in the Persian Empire. At this time, they were fighting against the Parthians, but later on they would fight against what we call the Sassanian Persian Empire. And so this was not a really sustainable empire. Internally, as we discussed last class, there was a contradiction. They were an empire, but they believed themselves to be republic. It was important for them to maintain republican institutions like the Senate, even though it was to the detriment of the management of the empire. What I mean by that is that throughout this time, on paper, in theory, it was committee, it was ruled by committee. The Senate was really in command. And as we discussed in previous classes, the Senate is composed of the Roman aristocracy, the ruling houses of Rome. And when you have that, when you have committee, rule by committee, when powers divide up evenly among the ruling houses of an empire, the only thing they can really agree on is to be corrupt together. And so the Senate was a huge problem because they basically monopolized wealth. And there was a lot of discontent in the provinces, there was a lot of discontent among the people. And the Romans tried different solutions to this. But none of the solutions worked. And eventually, we had something called the third century crisis, the crisis of the third century, which basically meant the Roman Empire was about to disintegrate. There were civil wars going on. There were these invasions from the north. There was economic collapse. There was a plague. So in the third century, it really seemed the Roman Empire was on the brink of complete implosion. Then a military genius by the name of Dio Cresci, he re-evaluated the empire and he recognized we basically needed to change the system. And we needed to make radical changes in order to save the Roman Empire. As you can see, it is extremely difficult to protect Rome against the barbarian invaders over time. Eventually, the western portion of the empire will be overrun by these barbarians, who we call the Germanics, the Goths, the Slavs, the Huns. Basically, these are the successors to the Yemair people and they come from the steppes. So they are extremely aggressive, mobile people who will eventually overrun the Roman Empire and they will establish basically the tribes that will eventually give us the modern states of Germany, Britain, France. So basically these are the ancestors of Western Europeans. All right. So as you can see, these barbarians, they were established their own empires, and all that we left after about the year 500 is the Eastern Roman Empire, which is a successor to the Roman Empire. And even though they call themselves Romans, and they identify themselves as Romans, Historians refer to the Eastern Roman Empire as the Byzantines. Again, they themselves did not call themselves the Byzantines. It's what later historians call them. So the man who makes this transition, who basically is a founder of the Byzantine Empire, his name is Constantine the Great. And what he does that's very important is that he shifts capital from Rome to Byzantium on the phosphorus. And today we call this place Constantinople. It's still there, guys, if you want to visit. It's called Istanbul in Turkey. And it's a beautiful city, definitely one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Now, the question is, sorry, I skipped. The question then is, why was this move made? And what modern historians believe is that this was a strategic decision. First of all, Rome was not easily defended. So it's very common throughout its history for it to be overrun by provincial military governor. So think of Julius Caesar, but also there were others as well who did the same thing, who were extremely successful in the provinces, and they took their military and conquered Rome. It was very easy to overrun Rome and then declare himself emperor. So by moving into Constantinople, the city, the capital is now imprenetrable. It is impossible to besiege, it is easily defensible, and how so I will show you later on. The other thing that's really important about this transition is, Constantinople is really at the center of the empire now. Rome was too far to the west, and most of the Roman empires' most wealthy provinces, the most important province, like Egypt, Anatolia, and the Lavaht, were actually in the east. So it's recognition, the fact the center of gravity in the empire was really in the east. And the third reason is, again, throughout most of its history, Rome's main competitor were the Persian Empire to the east. And so by moving to Constantinople, it allows the emperor to most easily and most directly respond to the threat of the Persians. So this is the scholarly consensus. But as I will show you later on, I disagree with this consensus. I think there was a much more important reason why Constantine made this move. Okay? The Byzantine Empire becomes the birthplace of modern Christianity. Okay? Constantine the Great is the first Christian Roman emperor, he conversed to Christianity, but not only that, but he lays the intellectual basis for modern Christianity through something called the Council of Nicaea, Nicaea, the pronunciation is different. It's properly pronounced Nicaea, but most people pronounce it Nicaea. So the Council of Nicaea. We talked about this last semester where the Council of Nicaea was established to answer a theological debate in the Christian world. What is the nature of Jesus? What is the relationship with God? As we discussed, one One more popular interpretation, explanations is the idea of Arianism where Jesus is a lesser divinity to God. The Council of Nessia, Nacchia, established the idea of the Holy Trinity, which is that God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit are co-equal. They are separate, but they are co-equal. We call this the Holy Trinity, the Godhead. So that is Constantine's major contribution. Constantine, one of his successors, Theodosius, makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. There is now a crackdown on both the idea of paganism, which used to be the religion of the Roman Empire, as well as the idea of heresy, especially the idea of Arianism. He also builds and calls the field of the Doshan walls, which makes Constantinople basically impenetrable, okay? It makes it a impenetrable fortress and allows Constantinople to stand for a thousand years. As you can see from the field, those two walls, it's huge, okay? This is just a person. You can see that there are two walls. There's a mold protecting it. So for a thousand years, these walls protected the city. There were not many soldiers in the city. You didn't actually need that many soldiers to protect against invaders. The other thing, so these walls are still stand today. You can actually go get on a plane, fly to Istanbul, and visit these walls. Okay, they were basically designed to stand for all eternity. And that was the idea of Constantinople, the eternal city. They also had sea walls. So not only could you not attack Constantinople from land, you couldn't even attack it by sea. One of the great inventions of Constantinople is the idea of Greek fire. The story is that they were being attacked by the Muslims. This is in the eighth century, when the Muslims are expanding throughout the world. They're conquering both the Sasanian Empire as well as the Roman Empire. and they want to obviously overrun Constantinople. And ultimately, what saves the city is invention of some called quick fire, which is basically kerosene. You take kerosene, you throw it at someone, and then the boat is light on fire. And the story is that this was invented by a Hellenized Jew who converted Christianity. And he has this great idea, and then he He approaches the emperor with this invention. The emperor believes that he is an angel sent by God to save the city. And so it is impossible to actually launch a naval expedition against Constantinople because they'll just burn down your ships. At the height of the Byzantine Empire, it almost reestablishes, reconstitutes the entire Roman Empire. And this is the year 565. At this point, the Emperor is Justinian. And at this point, the one who is leading the military of the Byzantines, his name is Bilasirius, and he's considered the last great Roman general. His military genius is on par with that of Julius Caesar, Hannibal, all the great generals. through his military conquest, but the Byzantine Empire is able to expand its influence. But as we learn in this class, once you reach a peak of empire, there are problems. So the first problem is that your city becomes overpopulated, and when your city becomes overpopulated, it becomes acceptable to the plague. So there's something called a Justinian plague, which wiped out anywhere between 50 to 60% of the entire population of Constantinople. At this point, the population of the city is about 500,000, half a million. The plague killed 300,000 people. That's a lot of people, okay? Even today, scholars debate where this plague came from. Originally we believe it came from grain ships from Egypt, right? Because Constantinople imports all its food from Egypt. And so there were rats on these ships, and these rats spread basically the Bobonic plague. Now historians believe that actually came from the steppes, the Huns, and through their invasion. So we don't know what happened. We just know they killed a lot of people. And this greatly reduced the power of the empire. Also, when you have these military conquests, you over-extend it. So it is very difficult to maintain this empire. And the third problem is that whenever there's a military expansion, the empire, the emperor, comes into conflict with the general. So even those Justinian and Bilisarius, they were great friends. The wives were great friends. They themselves had a lot of personal conflict. In fact, towards the end of his life, Bilisarius was actually tried for treason. And there were many times when Belisarius was on military campaign, it was clear that Justinian was trying to sabotage him. Because obviously if you're emperor, you're afraid that your general, your great conquering general, will eventually come back and take your throne. So because of what happened between Justinian and Belaris, basically this was the last time that the Bison genes embarked on a massive military campaign. Okay, from now on, they're defensive and also they focus on the idea of diplomacy, basically bribing their enemies not to attack them, especially the Huns, but also the Arabs as well as the Persian Empire. This is the Hagia Sophia, the Cathedral to Wisdom and this is the great monument, the great legacy of the Byzantine Empire. It's absolutely beautiful. Again guys, this is what's amazing. It's still there. Okay, you can actually get on a plane, go to Istanbul and visit this place. It's absolutely gorgeous. Definitely worth visiting. All right, now why did Constantinople fall? And so what happened was that again, even though Constantinople itself is impenetrable, it's invincible, It's still an empire. And so eventually, its regions were eventually overrun by great enemies. So for example, in about the year 1450, and this is three years before the eventual fall of the city, the Ottoman Empire just, it's basically taken over the Byzantines. And the only city left standing is Constantinople. So you can see over here are the Ottomans. Over here is the Ottomans. Okay, the Ottomans were able to conquer the city because of the invention of siege engines Okay, these are these cannons are as big as houses and they basically Overwhelm the walls and allow the Ottomans to overrun the city now what's important to understand is Even though the bison teens were Christian and the Ottomans were Muslim and even though the Turks overran the city, the Turks were extremely respectful to the citizens of the city, because they were considered the heirs, the successors to the Roman Empire. And this was the center of what we call the Orthodox Church. So the citizens worked extremely well. This again is another picture of the Siege of Constantinople. All right, let's talk lastly about the significance and power of the city. The city was the center of the world for hundreds of years, both intellectually, because again it was here to not just the Roman Empire, but also to Greek civilization. It was also in terms of trade, the capital of the world, because it was a meeting place of both the Aegean, which leads to the Mediterranean, as well as the Black Sea, which leads into, what is Russia today? Okay, so if you wanted to go anywhere, you basically had to go through Constantinople. It was really the center of the world and through trade, taxing trade, the city became extremely wealthy. Also because it was the center of the world, it was very multicultural, very cosmopolitan. You had basically all major ethnicities living inside the city. Jews, Christians, Muslims were altered with extreme tolerance. They basically had their own quarters within the city. Okay, as you can see at its height, the city was extremely beautiful and very wealthy. It was really for 100 years, the capital of the world, the capital of the universe, basically. As you can see, it is almost impossible to beseech. You can never cut it off from supplies. You can never isolate the city because it is the meeting place of so many rivers. This is the Vospers. So that is the Roman Empire. So this is, again, what we know about it. And now I'm going to explain my theory to these three questions. Why did Constantine make the move from Rome to Byzantium? Why did it arise? Why did it decline? But before I start with my explanation, are there any questions about what I just presented? This is all pretty basic stuff. This is stuff you can find on the internet, on Wikipedia. You can ask chat, GBT, and it'll probably give you the same answers. But are there any questions so far about Constantinople and the Bosnian Empire before I present my ideas? Was this clear to you guys? Any questions, guys? Right, okay, that's a great question. So culturally were the Romans at this time Greek or Roman? And you actually write duck in that Greek culture is really the hegemon, right? I mean it's so many, so much so superior to Roman culture. I mean Romans really were peasants who built an empire but the Greeks basically built western civilization. Okay, you had Homer, you had Plato, you had Herodotus. the Romans were aware of this. And this was a conflict within Roman culture, civilization for a long, long time. Because they felt that even though they had conquered the world, they were about to be conquered culturally by the Greeks. So the Romans were aware of this and they rebelled against this. And you weren't here for my lecture on the Iniad, but really, Augustus sees a response to the writing of the Iniad in response to the hegemony of Greek culture. So even though you're right in that most of the Roman aristocracy, they embrace Greek culture, such as like Mark Anthony, right? Mark Anthony saw himself as more Greek than Roman. There was a lot of pushback from the empire against this. Okay? So, but eventually, as we'll see, eventually Greek culture does triumph. All right, so let me explain how. All right, so the first question I want to look at is why did Constantine make the move from Rome to Byzantium? Okay? So let me give you some background. So during the time of Augustus, Augustus, we today see him as the first Roman emperor. But he doesn't himself see himself as the first emperor. He's just saw himself as just a citizen of Rome. Okay? Here's what we call a prince-sap, or he calls himself a prince-sap. This is where we get the modern English word prince, as well as principal, high school principal. And it just means first citizen. So again, the problem with Rome is that you had the aristocracy through the Senate monopolized all wealth and power. And this led to a lot of contradictions and conflicts within the Roman Empire. And so the solution that Augustus proposed is make the prince that make me the CEO. Okay, this is still committee. It's still rule by committee, but I'll be the coordinator. I'll be the CEO. Okay. And the idea here was even though this was not a great system, it did preserve the culture. Okay, the history, the legacy, and the traditions of the Roman people. And that was what was important to protect and preserve the culture, especially the idea of libertas, okay, liberty. But this system didn't really work, right? You had these civil wars, you had a lot of provincial riots, rebellions. So the solicitism simply didn't work. And this led to what we call the crisis of the third century, when basically the the one empire was about to collapse. And again, as we said, a governor, a commander named Dirk Lysian, he saved the one empire by reuniting. And at this point, he's like, this system doesn't work. What we need to do is study the Persian empire. Because even though we don't like the Persians, their empire seems a lot more sustainable and continuous than our empire. And so this started a period what we call the dominant. Basically the idea of starting an imperial bureaucracy, centralizing power with the emperor through the bureaucracy. And the Romans hated this idea. What Emperors discovered is this cultural shift, the Romans just found it actually disgusting. Go back to the assassination of Julius Caesar. The Romans are extremely culturally arrogant. Why did they assassinate Julius Caesar? And the people who assassinated Julius Caesar were his best friends. In fact, we believe Marcus Brutus, who was one of the lead conspirators, was actually his spyological son. Why? Because Julius Caesar was threatening the cultural traditions of Rome. They were afraid that Julius Caesar would become king. So what these emperors, first under the Cretacean, but especially under Constantine, discovered is it's really hard to change culture. And there's really one solution to this problem. Okay, to understand this, let's run a thought experiment, okay? Okay, so you understand the percentage of culture. Okay, so we're at school, and this school is known for being innovative. It's known for being student-centered. It focuses a lot on activities and extracurriculars, right? And that's great, I'm very supportive of this. But let's just say that the school brings me in as a consultant and asked me to help improve the school. And I spend months interviewing students and teachers. I feel this school is great in terms of innovation, but it needs to focus more on academics. Kids need to read more. kids need to focus more on test scores. And then you have a perfect balance, okay? And that's my solution. Well, I'm pretty sure if I tried that, I'd be fired within a week, okay? And the reason why is I am attacking your cultural traditions. I'm attacking your identity, your sense of self. So if I want to implement my vision, I can't force my vision on you. The only thing I can really do is switch schools and build my own school. Does that make sense to you guys? Okay, and this is a pretty persistent thing throughout the world. So that's why Constantine made the move to Byzantium. He recognized that if I'm gonna build an empire and Rome needs to be an empire if it is to endure, I need to switch cultures. And the best way to switch culture is by moving your capital from Rome to Byzantium. And when he did that, the entire culture shifted. So let me very quickly explain the cultural shift. In Rome, it was pagan. Oh, by the way, pagan is not the word that they use. Pagan is a word that Christians use to insult them, basically. But for the Sikhs and Communions, we'll use the word pagan. That was a religion. They were Roman, meaning that they had a distinct cultural identity. And lastly, they were republic, meaning they were run by the Senate, basically. Not just Senate, but by tradition and by custom. By consensual pole, the Byzantine Empire was completely different. First of all, it was Christian. And the pagan and Christian worldview are in conflict with each other. This is a major shift. Second is they were multicultural. So as Doug says, in the time of Rome, in the time of Augustus, there was a major conflict, major debate between Roman culture and Greek culture. But when they switched over to Constantinople, they completely embraced Greek culture. In fact, the language switched from being Roman to Greek. They spoke Greek. And they embrace Greek culture. Herodotus, Plato, were major thinkers that the Byzantine Empire embraced and celebrated. And lastly, it switched from a republic, meaning that it went, being run by a senate, to an empire. Which basically meant it was being run by a bureaucracy. Okay? So, Byzantine, the Byzantine Empire, is a very distinct entity from the Roman Empire. Historians today argue the Basin Empire is continuation of the Roman Empire, but that's only a superficial and shallow understanding. Culturally, the Basin Empire was a radical departure from the Roman Empire or the Roman Republic. And so I will explain what these differences are. And it's important because it's going to inform our understanding of future events in Western civilization. So let me first explain the difference in worldview between the pagan and the Christian. All right, pagan. And again, guys, I would make a lot of generalizations, but it's a useful framework for the understanding of ancient cultures. So what's the pagan worldview? When the pick and roll would be there are different layers to your understanding of the world. The forces, the supernatural forces that you enact with intimately are the gods. And the gods is really a metaphorical way to understand nature. So in nature, there are all of these natural forces that we can't really see. For example, the wind. really see the wind, but also we can't really see creativity or luck. Well, in the pagan world view, these hidden invisible forces are rendered and expressed as gods. Okay, and the gods are those that we interact with every day on an intimate basis. It was very important for us to maintain good relations with the gods by making ritual tributes to the gods. Okay, so sacrifice and rituals were a very important part of the pagan worldview. Both the gods are actually even higher invisible forces that no one has control of, okay, which includes fate, which includes luck, okay, fortune, okay, but there are these invisible forces that even the gods must submit to. And then at the highest level are what are called called unwritten and immutable. Immutable just means unable to change eternal laws of the universe. And think of this structure as giving the universe some order and structure. So think of gravity, right? It's an unwritten and immoral law of the universe. Then what they really mean by this is the idea really of karma or justice. If you do good in the world, good will happen to you. If you do evil in the world, evil will happen to you. It may not happen to you, but it may happen to your children, okay? So there is a cosmic balance to the world. And this is really the pagan worldview, right? The Christian worldview is very simple. There's you, okay? You, and then there's God. And the thing that matters is your personal relationship with God. That's it, guys. So let's look at the three major differences between the pagan worldview and the Christian worldview. And again, this is a generalized, simplified version. And we use it in order to be clear about the differences and that there are, in fact, differences. All right, so the three major differences are this. The Christian worldview introduces into the Roman world three ideas that really exist before. They are truth, evil, and the individual. Now these ideas actually existed in other traditions like the Jewish tradition and the Persian tradition through Zoroastrianism, but they really didn't exist in the Greek and the Roman tradition. So the counterpart to truth in the pagan tradition is the idea of chaos or luck. So there's no structure to the universe. In the Christian worldview, there's a God who has designed the universe, and that is the truth. So the intention of God is the truth. The plan is the truth, whereas in the pagan worldview, there's no design, guys. It's just complete random chaos. and you just have to do, try your best in this world. In the Christian worldview, it's the idea of evil, which is if you go against the intention of God, you commit sin, that is evil. Now what's interesting for us is, in the pagan worldview, the opposite idea is action. In other words, in a world of chaos, you have to act, you have to do stuff. If you refuse to act, you are a slave. So think back to the Iliad. In the Iliad, Achilles says why he is in Troy, why he's fighting in Troy. And he says that before he came to Troy, he was told his fate. He could either die old, back at home, or he could die young in Troy. but by dying young in Troy, he'll become famous. He'll be remembered forever. And for Achilles, that's not really a choice. What he's being told is, you must come to Troy and you must die, and that will win you eternal glory. It's the idea of action. Also, think of the Romans. In their legends, they have a name, named Musius. Remember at the beginning of the Roman Republic, The Romans are besieged by the attrition king. And Moushius is a young normal man, only 20 years old. He decides to assassinate the king in order to free the Romans. He swims across the Tiber, and he's about to do his deed, but it's payday, and the king is with his secretary. And they look alike. They dress alike, they look alike. And Moushius is hiding with his dagger, and he knows it's 50-50, okay? Now, for us, we'd be like, You know what? 50-50 is terrible odds. So let me come back another day, or let me be more patient. But for Moussius, it's fortune favors the bold. So he's like, 50-50 is great odds. I'm never getting better odds. So he takes his, he takes his, that he kills the secretary, okay? He misses. Then he's captured by the king. And the king wants to torture him and force him to confess. And the king started to listen to him and says, I will burn you alive. Okay, there's a great fire beside Moussius. If you do not tell me the truth. And what Moussius does is, he puts his hand into the fire and lets it burn in front of the king. And that scares the king, okay? That's the idea of action. You make your fortune for your action. You cannot soot and wait. You cannot deliberate. You cannot be clever. You just ask. You're just brave, okay? That's a pagan worldview. This is important for us because the people who will feature in our course, who's very important and who follows worldview are also the Vikings. So the Vikings share the similar world view. It's a pagan world view. The last thing is the idea. In the Christian world view, it's an individual that matters. The individual's soul is what matters. But in the pagan world view, what matters is the community. Why are Achilles, why is Achilles fighting in Troy? Why is Mousseus sacrificing himself for Rome? Because they want to be remembered by the community. All right, so let me give you two examples of this. Let's go back to the Aelia, Hector, remember Hector? Hector in Aelia, he is the greatest Trojan warrior and he's destroying the Greeks because Achilles refused to fight. But then Achilles enters the battlefield, and at this point, Hector's lieutenant tells him, Hector, Achilles is back. Let's go home. Let's go hide behind the walls of Troy. We'll be fine. But Hector says, no. Fortune favors the both. The gods are with me. And so, of course, Achilles and the Greeks destroy the Trojans. And they're all forced to run back to the walls of Troy. Every woman enters Troy except for Hector. Hector stays outside the walls of Troy and waits for Achilles to come. He knows for a fact that Achilles will kill him. Achilles is a god. He's a great warrior, but he's not a god. And at this point, he knows he's about to be killed. And most of us would just sneak back into the walls of Troy, right? He can't do that because he's afraid of being laughed at by his lieutenant. He's afraid of shame. He has to die for his community. So that's Hector. But also, think about Lucretia. Lucretia. Lucretia, remember, is the woman, noble woman who is raped by the son of Tarkinius, Tarkinia's super bus the last king of Rome and this is what starts the rebellion that Overfroze the Roman monarchy Lucretia is raped and then she kills herself Because she's dishonored and Augustine remember Augustine instead of God he writes about this Okay, and from his perspective It was a crime for Lucretia to kill herself Why? Because we are all the creation of God. Therefore we are the property of God. Therefore when we cure ourselves, when we cure ourselves, we are committing a sin against God. We are basically stealing from God. That's why if you commit suicide you'll be condemned to hell forever. You'll be condemned to damnation forever. And then Augustine explains, Lucretia killed herself because she's afraid of the shame that she would have to endure if she lived. She was afraid that she'd be laughed at by the other woman of Rome. And that's the idea of community versus the individual. All right? Okay. So it's a rather different worldview, the pagan versus the Christian. Let me explain some other differences. For example, the attitude towards sex. Okay? Christians, because we live in a Christian world, we know that sex is bad. Okay? Sex should only happen between husband and wife, and it should only happen for the purpose of procreation. We shouldn't do it because we enjoy it. The pagans have the complete opposite attitude towards sex. Sex was to be embraced. It was to be enjoyed. It was to be celebrated. Why? because if the gods didn't mean for us to have sex, they wouldn't make it so much fun. Okay, so sex was a very important part of pagan life. As well as violence, okay? They also embraced and celebrated violence. So think about the Vikings, think about the Romans, right? They loved violence. And the Christians hated violence. So the argument is that the Christian worldview is an improvement on the pagan worldview because the pagans, they have things like orgies. They have things like child sacrifice. They have things like genocide, okay? This is all bad, right? But remember, and this is really important, okay? These are just two different worldviews. And it's hard for us to objectively assess which one is better. They only say that they both have their benefits and they both have their consequences. Okay? So an example is food. If we were to go to America today and look at the food that Americans eat, we'd be disgusted, right? Hamburgers, Coca-Cola, French fries. But guess what, guys? If Americans were to come to China, they would be equally disgusted by the food that Chinese eat, okay? Like Malatang and this stuff. Okay? really bad for you. So I would keep that in mind. It's easy for us to be culturally arrogant and say, like, we are so better than these ancients. But it's all a matter of perspective. If we were to go back in time and look at the Pagan world, we'd be disgusted by the murders, by the violence, by all the sex going on. But at the same time, and this is really hard for us to understand, but if they were to come here, They're the time travel and come here and see our world. They be disgusted. Because from their perspective, we behave like slaves. Achilles is out winning glory on the beaches of Troy. While we are in school memorizing useless facts so that we can get useless pieces of paper so that we can make useless pieces of money. Of money is paper. They would not understand why we're doing this to ourselves. So I would keep that in mind. Like the pagan worldview is very different from the Christian worldview, and that's it. All right? And in fact, we will later in the semester discover that there are some thinkers, such as Nietzsche, Frederick Nietzsche, who believe that the switch from the pagan worldview to the Christian worldview was a major setback in the development of civilization. Okay? All right, any questions about the difference between the pagans and the Christians before I move on? Any questions? Was this clear? All right. Now let's move on to the idea of republic versus empire. And look, I mean, the differences are pretty stark. So in a republic, it's usually like egalitarianism. Everyone's opinion does matter. And in an empire, there's a hierarchy. So that's the first major difference. In the Republic, people are egalitarian. And in an empire, there's a hierarchy. So think of this. In the Persian Empire, if you were to meet the emperor, what you have to do was prostrate yourself first and then kiss his feet. That's the idea of empire. But in the Republic, you didn't do that. In fact, even though Rome was becoming a welfare city, A major tradition in Rome was you didn't lock your doors. You didn't have guards. So a senator who was in charge of gold, he was literally, he could literally put millions of people to death if he wanted to, he didn't lock his door. So you, the lowliest Roman, could just walk into his house and have tea with him or coffee with him and talk about life, okay? That was the tradition in Rome. Also another thing is when Roman senators walk the streets of Rome, they always carry an umbrella, something called to protect themselves. And the reason why is this, Roman houses were two stories. And they didn't have a switch system. So if you need to go to the bathroom, you did so using a bucket on the second floor. And so what happened is, if you saw someone you didn't like walk the streets you would actually take your bucket and throw all this shit at him. Okay that's literally what they did. So if you're a senator you could be the most powerful man in the world but you could still literally risk having shit thrown at you. So that's the Roman world. It was egalitarian. Where's an empire? There's hierarchy. So in the egalitarian world it means there's openness. or open to new ideas, there's debate. Literally anyone could propose a new idea. Whereas in the empire, it was a very closed system. They didn't like new ideas. So go back to the example of Greek fire. A guy, and it's a story so we don't know it's true, but a guy had to go to the emperor and get his approval before the military could adopt it. That's really inefficient, guys. The Greeks would have just gone and done it. The Romans would have let the commanders make their own decisions. It would not have happened the decision of the Senate. It would have been the decision of the military commander that was appointed by the Senate. So the Republic would be much more innovative than the Empire, because the Republic would be much more open. So there'd be a lot more diversity in the Republic and in an empire, things would be much more conformist. You would have a lot more creatively, a lot more diversity within the Republic than within an empire. And that's kind of intuitive because if you think about it, an empire has so much more people and so much more wealth and resources than the Republic. But historically, we found that republics and democracies are much more innovative and creative than empires. The reason has to do with the idea of a bureaucracy. Something that a democracy or a republic does not have is the idea of an imperial bureaucracy. They have bureaucracies where they're not that big and they're not imperial. So let's talk about bureaucracy. And this is a very important idea that I want you guys to remember for the rest of the semester, because we will refer to this idea. Now, in the beginning, bureaucrats are good for empires, because what they do is they do centralization. They're able to centralize the empire. You let the empire, basically. The second thing that they do that's important is the idea of systemization. Basically, keep records, create laws, systemization. And last is the idea of standardization, standardization, uniformity. So getting people to speak the same language, getting people to use the metric system, getting people to use money. And this creates tremendous wealth within the empire in the early years. Because again, what you have is you have the creation of money because you have a legal system and you have a monopoly on violence. Monopoly on violence just means that these neighbors don't fight anymore, because there's a police. There are these courts. They can just sue each other. There's a legal system and people are now using money. This leads to contracts and this leads to trade and increased economic activity. So you have peace and prosperity. People feel safe, people feel that life is predictable, so they do more, they work harder. And this leads to in the early stages of an empire to tremendous prosperity. But over time, what will happen is this bureaucracy will ossify. Meaning the people within the bureaucracy will think of how to use bureaucracy for their own personal benefit. We can say this is corruption. So centralization leads to corruption, where just a minority of people with all the power use it for their own personal benefit. They're basically parasites. The technical word we use for this is rent seeking. Rent seeking. So figure landlords who charge rent to the tenants. Well, if it's a monopoly, You think in charge as much as they want. There's nothing you can do about it. Okay, so it's what we call rent seeking. So, centralization eventually eats a corruption. Systemization leads to ultimately stagnation. There's nothing new going on. And centralization leads to the idea of conformity or hominization, okay? Where everything becomes the same. Where everything is bland. Does that make sense? All right. OK. So why this happens is because even though the bureaucracy is only an institution among different institutions. So think about this. You have to compute bureaucracy, but they are competing against the court system, which is basically emperor. And the court is usually controlled by eunuchs. So these are servants of the emperor. The bureaucracy is up against the court. It's also up against the nobility, right? The traditional power of society. It's also up against the military. It's also up against the church. Okay, so there are different institutions that can counter the bureaucracy. But over time, in terms of peace and prosperity, if things are really stable, eventually, the bureaucracy triumphs over all these other institutions. Okay, and the reason why is this? First is the bureaucracy can monopolize status, okay, and mobility. So if you're just an ordinary person, well, the best way to rise from a society is through the bureaucracy. This is certainly true in China, right? where everyone's to be a bureaucrat because that's seen as the mechanism of achieving social status as well as social mobility. Also, properties monopolize information. It controls what information flows into the system. It controls what the emperor sees. Okay, so we say this is about censorship and secrecy. And the last thing that it does is it monopolizes the idea of narrative. Okay, it it controls the production of culture and we can So it does this mainly through the process of writing history okay, so our history is the creation of a cultural narrative to bind people together and it's usually the imperial bureaucrats who do this in other words what's important for us to understand is the The bureaucrats have a monopoly of literacy and knowledge. They control the schools, they control the media, they control history writing, they control how you think and write. So even though these are, they're competing institutions, the bureaucracy, by controlling this meta reality, that's culture, it controls the way like these other institutions behave. So the example I want to use is the idea of the Godhead, the Godhead. So my argument to you is the Godhead, it's really a bureaucratic invention. Because remember, during the concept of Nicaea, there's a debate as to the nature of Jesus. They're these Aryans who believe that Jesus was a lesser divinity. Then there are people who believed in modalism, who just believed the Holy Spirit, Jesus, and God were different forms of the same entity. And you have partialism, which is to say that they are a part of the same entity. And these three different explanations make sense, they make intuitive sense. The idea of the Godhead where God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are co-equal, separate, but the same thing, makes no sense. And the reason why they would do this is to create a sense of mystery, right? And distance, and secrecy. And that, my friends, is the definition of a bureaucracy, right? I'm not sure if you dealt with bureaucracies, I have. They suck. They dehumanize you. So think of, I'll just use a silly example, right? So in America, there's something called a census. And on the census, you have to write down what racial group you belong to. And the racial group I belong to, if I were American, is Asian American, right? Guess what? Guess who else belongs in that group? Indian people, Vietnamese people, Japanese people, Korean people. That makes no sense. We know that in Asia, the Indian culture, it's vastly different from the Japanese culture, which is vastly different from the Korean culture and the Chinese culture and the Vietnamese culture. These are different people with their own belief systems. But in a bureaucracy, it just categorizes everyone together almost randomly or indifferently. Okay? And that's why I would make the argument that ultimately multicultural societies are not as creative as tribal societies, okay? Tribal versus multicultural. Think about the multicultural societies that are around us today, okay? Singapore is a multicultural society. Canada is a multicultural society. They're not very creative guys. They're They're very bland, they're very conformist, they're very bureaucratic. Okay? Very tribal societies, like the Greeks, the Greeks were extremely tribal, they were extremely chauvinistic, they were extremely creative, right? As were, as are the Europeans, okay? As are the Vikings. And the reason why is tribalism is energetic. It makes you passionate. it makes you think deeply about the world. Whereas in a multicultural society, people have to spend their energies getting along with each other. It's important not to be offensive. Okay? And so it's because of these three reasons, the certain cultural construct of the Byzantine Empire. It was Christian, it was multicultural. The word we can also use is called some polythene. Also, it was bureaucratic. The Byzantines were not a very creative people. Even though they had access to every culture in the world, even though they had access to the classics, like Plato, Homer, Herodotus, as well as Virgil, they were not that creative. In fact, if you had a genius like Homer or Dante living in the Byzantine Empire, Well, he would just become a bureaucrat. We would never know the genius of Homer and Dante. Homer and Dante could only arise in tribal societies. So that, yeah. So does that make sense to you guys? And again, this is just an introduction to the conflict between these political systems, Empire versus Republic, bureaucracy versus, yeah. We will continue these themes and these topics as we move on throughout Western history. But I first wanna introduce these ideas to you. It's really important that you understand the differences between paganism and Christianity, because we'll be referring to this conflict, this division later on in the semester as well. Any questions about this? Please feel free to argue, okay? Please feel free to ask questions, to argue, because when you do that, it helps me improve my own thinking, right? Any comments, any feedback? Okay, so I wanna give you guys some time to think about questions, but before I do that, I want to look ahead over the next couple of weeks and tell you what we're doing, OK? So we did the Roman Empire, then we did the Byzantines. So as I explained to you, the Roman Empire, Western Roman Empire, will collapse in year 476 when the last emperor, Romulus Augustus, is the post, OK? But when he's the post, people don't understand the Roman Empire has come to an end, OK? because the people who are still in charge think the Roman Empire is continuing. But now we have a long period of civil wars throughout Europe. And these civil wars will eventually lead to something called the Holy Roman Empire, which is what Charlemagne or the Franks will create. And this will lead, interesting for us, to the rise of the Vikings. Now vikings are important because they will go on and basically influence British culture as well as Russian culture. So Russia comes from the idea of the Rus. The Rus are basically just Vikings. Over here we will begin, we will see the beginning of the Abassad Caliphate which which is really the golden age of the Muslims. But eventually they'll be conquered by the Mongols. And the conquest of the Mongols will eventually take us into the Renaissance, Dante. And this will mark a new beginning in world history. So I just wanna explain to you what we're doing. We will definitely have to do the Holy Roman Empire. that's number one, then this will lead us to the Vikings, number two, then we'll talk about the Abbasid Caliphate number three, and then we'll talk about the Mongols, and then the Renaissance, okay? So this is what we're doing over the next two to three weeks. All right, we'll be going very fast throughout, we'll be going very fast this semester, okay? So just let you know, all right?"}
{"video_id": "_gH4PvIni5E", "title": "Civilization #END:  The Decline and Fall of the American Empire", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gH4PvIni5E", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 4015.6016875, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 10166, "text": "Okay, welcome to the very last class, the grand finale. Today we do the American Empire. July 1944, this is the Bretton Woods Hotel in New Hampshire. 40 nations get together and they discuss what the post-war peace will look like. Everyone knows that Nazi Germany will eventually be defeated, as well as Japan. So the question now is, how does the world build peace? and prosperity after such a devastating war. And the Americans propose the Bretton Woods system. The idea is this, the idea is to facilitate global trade. The American currency will become the reserve currency of the world, meaning that everyone can use it to trade. Now, the term we use for this is exorbitant privilege. This is like the power of God, because you're basically taking paper turned into gold, right? That's the power of God. So how can we ensure the Americans won't abuse this power? And the answer is the Americans agree to create a global financial network as well as peg the currency to gold, which means that the USD is a contract. And at any point, you can choose to exchange US dollars for gold. And so what America does is it transports all the gold from London to Fort Knox. And that becomes the basis for the new global financial system that we still have today. And it is incredibly successful. This is the Bank of Inertial Sentiments in Basel, Switzerland. And it is the Bank of Banks. It is the central bank of central banks. And the idea here is you need to create a system for risk mitigation. So for example, if maybe a country goes bankrupt, the other countries need to come in and rescue that country's economy. And so this bank is something you never heard of, but it's one of the most powerful institutions in the world because it facilitates the entire global financial economy. Brennan Woods also created something called the World Bank, which is based in Washington, DC. And what it does is that it gives out loans to third world nations like China. The IMF, the National Monetary Fund, coordinates global financial policy. So the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank, the IMF, among other organizations now becomes the global financial system. And underpinning all of this is the US dollar as the global reserve currency. Okay, so where did the system come from? What comes from 1688? Remember this is the year that when the Orange of the Netherlands, he goes to England and launches something called the Glorious Revolution. And he takes the throne from James II. When he goes to England, he also brings with him Dutch wealth. Because the Netherlands is now the most prosperous nation of the world because of global trade. They have something called the Dutch West Indies Company that has monopolized the spice trade in East Asia. Sorry, it's the Dutch East Indies Company. And so it's extremely wealth. Now as we discussed previously, the Dutch are cowardness. So they believe that there's a religious obligation for them to get wealthy. wealth will guarantee their entry into heaven. But for that to happen, they need to ensure their wealth is protected, right? And at this point in history, the Netherlands is being conquered or at war with France, with Spain, with a host of enemies. So the money's been saved in the Netherlands, so it's being transferred over to England, because England has a navy that is the most powerful in the world. It's also an island, so it's pretty hard to invade. 1694, this wealth becomes a basis of the Bank of England, which is considered a second oldest central bank in the world, but it's really the first central bank in the world. The reason why is this bank, it's a private bank, but it's guaranteed by parliament, which means that the nation state of England promises to always pay back the investors in this bank. So why does this happen? It happens because it will resolve a huge issue throughout human history. If you're a king, you need financing to go to war. You often need to pay for missionaries. To get this money, you need to basically borrow from your wealthiest citizens. The problem with this is, as king, you may not want to pay back that money after the war, or you could get killed in a war. Okay, so there's always tremendous risk when you lend money to the king. The Bank of England solves this problem because you're not lending money to the king, you're lending money to England, and the people will always have to pay you back. All right, so maybe they won't pay you back today, but they'll have to pay you back sooner or later, okay, because it's guaranteed by parliament. And the system is extremely successful. In fact, this system is what allows England to defeat Napoleon in the no-planet wars. Okay? In 1815, Napoleon is finally defeated. So as we discussed previously, Napoleon, he is a military genius. And he conquers most of Europe. And he defeats England many, many times. But because of the Bank of England, the English have infinite financing. So the British are always financing wars against Napoleon until he is finally defeated. and this establishes the British Empire. Okay, so after the defeat of Napoleon and France, Britain becomes the global hegemon. And the Bank of England now becomes an imperial bank. And the power of this is, before when you go and conquer a country or a nation, you're always afraid of rebellion. You're always afraid of local elite getting together and overflowing you. But the Bank of England solves this problem. Why? It solves this problem because now the local elite can take their corrupt earnings and put it in the Bank of England. So now the elite have an incentive to work with the British to maintain their empire. And that's how Britain was able to build the world's first truly global empire and able to maintain such harmony and stability with the empire for such a long time. the secret was international finance as embodied by the Bank of England. So let's summarize the history of central banking. It's complicated, but we need to understand this history. We understand today's world. First important idea is the Dutch Calvinist, their religious obsession with storing wealth. They remember we discussed this, right? The Protestant religion demands that you get rich. The pollen of England guarantees this wealth, does give England infinite financing for wars. This is important because if Parliament is willing to guarantee financing, not only can it use all this wealth stored in the Bank of England, but it can also generate new wealth from investors overseas as well. Third idea, this financing, infinite financing, allows Britain to defeat Napoleon. Fourth, the Bank of England stores wealth of corrupt local elites, allowing for stability and harmony within the empire. Now this is important. What will happen next is America will emulate this model and create something called the Federal Reserve in the year 1914. So the idea of the Federal Reserve is if all these provincial banks around America, they get together and decide that we as private banks will convince the government, the Congress, to give us a power to print money. How do you print money? You issue loans, okay? When you issue loans, So basically, it's putting money into the system. So in 1914, they developed the Federal Reserve System. And after World War II, America is now able to export this Federal Reserve System all around the world by creating independent central banks in each nation and having these central banks work together to create more wealth for their investors. So this is something really important you have to understand. Nation states compete against each other. But independent central states, all these nation states work together because that way it's easier for them to generate wealth for their investors. To grow capital, private central banks coordinate rather than compete. There are parasites that feed off the nation state. So this is a really important idea that no one understands. The nation state is responsible for protecting this wealth and the central banks can use the resources of the nation state to feed its capital growth. And this is the modern financial system that we have today. Central banks basically rule the world. Okay, so this is Carol Quigley, and he wrote a book called, Tragedy and Hope, which I highly recommend. He was a Georgetown professor. He was Bill Clinton's favorite professor at Georgetown. And in his book, he explains how this financial system works. So let's read it very carefully. And this is, and we talked about the 1920s. After World War I, the powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world, acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at infrequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the bank for international settlements in Basel, Switzerland. A private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in the hands of men like Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve, Charles Riss of the Bank of France, and Helmholt Schott of the Reds Bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. Okay, so in today's world, it's essential banks at a concert that dictate financial, economic, and political policy all around the world. All right, so how can we understand central banks? Well, the main function of central banks is to control the money supply. So money is just a concept. It's an idea. It's something that we just made up. And the way that central bank controls money is by controlling its scarcity, which creates the illusion that it's valuable. Also, you're forced to use money to buy things as well as pay taxes to get loans. And they control the interest rate, which is the cost of borrowing money. So now we're saying this is, what mechanism that Central Bank has to control the economy is by lowering or increasing interest rates. With lower interest rates, it's just easier to borrow money, right? So you can go buy a house or buy a car. They increase the interest rate, it's more expensive, so people spend less money. So through that mechanism, they're able to control the supply of money in the system. All right? All right, so how can we understand what Central Bankers are? Well, I'll give you three possible metaphors, okay? And I think these are all legitimate. Central bankers are the ultimate priests. They must control the flow of money to maintain the illusion that money is God. In this way, they are the new Catholic church, okay? Remember, the Catholic church in medieval Europe was the dominant power. It was beyond nations. It represented God on earth. Well, that's what central bankers are today. But also, you can think of central bankers as the game masters. They must control the flow of money to motivate people to play the game. As we discussed, we discussed the Americans. Today we live not in a civil civilization but in a game where all individual players try to make as much money as possible. Central bankers are the ones who control the rules of this game. Last metaphor is central bankers are drug pushers. To expand their dominance, they offer easy money. and once a country is addicted or bankrupt, they hijack the financial system, which means to prioritize or make independent the central bank. So how do central bankers work? Well, let's do an experiment. Let's use a thought experiment. Let's just say I'm in central bank and I'm trying to get you to become addicted to my power. So what I do is this. I say to you, hey, here's $10,000. And you're like, OK. And what do you want for $10,000? I'm like, nothing, just go enjoy yourself. So you take that $10,000 and you go on vacation to Hawaii, you live in a five star hotel, you're really happy, you come back and say, that was great, can I get more money? And I'm like, here, here's a million dollars, go and enjoy yourself. And you're like, what do you want for it? And I'm like, nothing, just go enjoy yourself. So you go, but this time you're smart and you're like, no, no, no, no, no, this money is limited. I need to go invest it if I want to generate more money. Otherwise, I'd go back to the bank and get more money. So you start doing, you start opening businesses, you invest in restaurants and ski resorts, who knows? Okay, but you have all these investments. The problem is, you really don't know what you're doing and you make these bad investments. And eventually what you recognize is, you're in debt now. You had a million dollars, but now you owe $10 million. So you come back to the bank and you say, listen, I need $10 million. I'm like, fine, but now you have to give me your soul. And you're like, you're just stuck, okay? That's how central banks work. I know this sounds terrible, but that's really how they work in the world. So now give you examples. All right, so what central banks do is they have the power of God. They're alchemists, basically, because they can take paper, which we know is worthless, and turn it into gold, which is what everyone wants. Now, something to remember, and this is really important, is that throughout history, whenever there's a major power, There's always a rising power that challenges it. So in our world today, there's no nation state that can challenge the power of central banks, but there are these technology companies that are arising that are trying to displace them from Goddard, okay? So Bitcoin is something they've invented. It is the American military's fail-safe system in case the American government defaults on the debt, and the US dollar loses its reserve currency status. So Bitcoin has been controlled by the American military along with certain technology companies, and they're trying to displace the USD. All right, so there's a conflict going on here. All right, also, artificial intelligence will be used to create the illusion of God, right? Why is there so much investment interest in artificial intelligence? Because even if it doesn't really work that well, it can trick people into believing it is God, that it is omniscient, that it is always right, that it's the ultimate authority. Last example, sorry. Last example is social media, video games point of the drug of the 21st century. So in other words, these technology companies, they're really in the process of creating a matrix in which we just live in a simulation and we're all slaves to the simulation. So this is something that we have to think about, how the central banks are in power and there's always powers that are arising which will challenge the power of the central banks. So how do we get this system? Go back to your 1950, 1960, the world started to do two, right? It's divided between the capitalist West and the communist East. Now this is ultimately a war of ideology. It's really a question of which system, capitalism or communism, it's better for humanity. Well, we don't know the answer to that question, but we do know the elite prefer capitalism because capitalism gives them more power, gives them more wealth. So the elites both in China and the Soviet Union, they basically give up, okay? In 1991, the Soviet Union basically unconditionally surrenders, and this creates the complete dominance of the American system, the Pax Americana. So once America has domination, it now can spread its system throughout the world. This is called Popper, and he wrote a book called The Open Society. And in it, he questions grand ideologies, because he believes that it's these grand ideologies like communism and fascism that destroyed the world and which have led to World War II. He hates Plato, he hates Marx, he hates Hegel. He thinks these are the three authoritarian philosophers in human history. And so what he proposes is that the height of civilization is the Anglo-American civilization. Okay? The The Germans and the Russians are bad because they are racist, because they are nationalistic, because they are grand in their vision. They're also trying to transform humans to shapes and things that are anti-human. But the Americans and the British, they are practical. They are utilitarian. They believe in evolution. And that's what Karl proper believes. The Anglo-American civilization is really the height of human civilization. But there's actually another way to understand the Pax Americana. And so the idea is, from World War II, we transferred the Pax Americana. And there are major differences, right? So World War II was about the nation state. That was the main constituent body of World War II. In the Pax Americana, what matters is the international rules-based order, which includes central banks but also includes the United Nations, right? World War II is about mercatilism. Mercatilism is that you only trade within your sovereignty. You only trade with your colonies. But Pax Americana argues for global free trade. Global free trade will lead to prosperity in the world. World War II argues for Union of Will, and Pax Americana argues for consumerism. The Union of Will is the idea that we must be a whole. That the constituent parts together are less than the whole. Consumerism is just, individuals should just go and spend money and enjoy their life. And don't worry about big problems like the nation state and the history of these ideas. All right, in other words, what's happened in our world is the world's gone from one that focused on civilization to a game. In a civilization, people are citizens who sacrifice themselves in order to obtain glory. So think of Achilles, right? Achilles went to Troy because he was a competition among his other Greeks to seek eternal glory. But in the game, we're all individual players who are trying to make as much money as possible. Now in theory, you're taught that, okay, the best way to do that is to work hard, be smart, be talented, create something innovative. But in reality, the best way to make money is by cheating. Okay, what is cheating? We're cheating is basically creating a monopoly. And then you're forced, and then once it's forced to pay as much as you want. Okay, so John Rockefeller, Bill Gates, these were all monopolists and they were the wealthiest people in human history. Okay, all right. So after World War II, America is the only major industrial nation left standing. And America used this opportunity to rebuild both its economy as well as the global economy. And it does so by transferring its wartime economy into a peacetime economy. In the wartime economy, you're measuring goods at mass, right? When the peacetime economy, you're also doing that. The problem though is now that you have peace, who's gonna buy these products? So what America did was it basically said to Europe, we'll meet these products, these manufactured goods, these cars and you will buy them. Europe is like, we have no money. And America is like, don't worry about it. We'll lend you the money. And so this worked out really well for America. If you were a white, high school graduate, male in America in the 1950s and 60s, 70s, you had the best life. You lived better than the ability of Rome. This is just a guy, he could be a salesperson, He could be a clerk, he could be a factory worker, but he had a car, in fact he had probably two cars. He had his own house, his wife didn't have to work, and he could send his three kids to college. Also they could take one or two vacations a year to Europe. It was really the best life, and that's what the Pax Americana created, okay? Prosperity and peace for the American middle class. But the problem is that over time, the Germans started to catch up. The Germans were destroyed in World War II, so they were incentivized to work together, to work hard to rebuild their civilization. And German manufacturing became famous throughout the world, as did Japanese manufacturing, okay? So now what's happening is, because of the superiority of German and Japanese manufactured goods, America was transitioning from a creditor nation, where everyone owed it money, to a debtor nation, where its consumers were buying things that it couldn't really afford from overseas. And again, America did do so because America had the US dollar after we deserved currency. 1961, Dwight Eisenhower is retiring from presidency and he says to the American people, I know we are at war with the Soviet Union, it's a Cold War, but we don't have any real enemies. Our enemies are all internal. There is currently in place something called the military industrial complex. They employ military people, they manufacture weapons, and they're intent on war. They are our true enemy. If we allow the military industrial complex to hijack the American political system, then we'll be constantly fighting these useless wars that will back up our nation. Be aware, this is our greatest threat to our nation in our history, okay? This is his farewell address. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced powers exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. He's talking about the military industrial complex. And it proved present and prophetic because after he retired, America will start engaging in wars around the world that it could neither afford nor could it fight properly in the Bank of America. Most famous example is the Vietnam War, Okay? Where America lost about 50,000 soldiers and killed millions and millions of Vietnamese civilians. It was a pointless, brutal war that almost bankrupted America. And it almost caused a civil war in America. Right? At this time, America was also competing with the Soviet Union in the space race. Right? So in 1969, America sent a man to the moon. And this is a real picture, okay? Now some of you might be like, some of you might be conspiracy theorists, okay? Not me, but some of you might be conspiracy theorists like, wait a minute here! Why is the lighting perfect on the moon? Right? And why are there no stars in space? And why is this flag flooding around, okay? Conspiracy theorists would ask these questions. I don't ask these questions because I'm not a conspiracy theorist. Just so we're completely sure, okay? Also at this time, Lyndon B. Johnson announced the Great Society, which was this fantastic social program to ensure that each and every American had an opportunity at the American Dream. Okay, so you had free healthcare for the elderly. You had programs like Head Start. It was fantastic, but it was also really, really expensive. So if you are a nation like France, you're like, you know what? America is sending people to the moon. It's fighting all these pointless wars and it's building all these great social programs for its population. Does America have the money to do this? In other words, is it possible that the US currency, the US dollar, is no longer able to repay its obligations? That's why France, under Charles de Gaulle, sent warships to America in the mid-60s to repatriate its gold. It's afraid that America will go bankrupt. And this proved very, very wise. And after France did this, there's now this fear among Americans that every nation will do this. And then every nation did this, America will go bankrupt. That's why in 1971 Richard Nixon announces the US dollar will no longer be tied to gold, which means that you can't use US dollars to buy gold anymore. Which means what? Which means the US dollar is based on nothing. The value of the US dollar is now based primarily on people's faith in its value. So this leads to a lot of problems like inflation and oil shock. So to solve this problem, in 1973, Nixon signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia. Basically agreement is that from now on, Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest oil exporter, will only take payments in US dollars. And whatever savings that Saudi Arabia has will be invested in US treasuries. Okay? So this is what we call the petrol dollar. And the idea here is now the value of the US dollar is tied to the value of oil, okay? You can always exchange US dollars for oil. But then Nixon did something that was all, that was extremely clever. He went to China, okay? So for the longest time, China and the United States were at a cold war. Americans basically isolated China. So in 1972, Nixon visited Mao Zedong. Why? The answer is very simple because he needed more consumers to buy US dollars. Does that make sense? He needed people to want US dollars. He needed to create a US dollar addiction. And to do this, what did America do? America gave China everything. America started to ship its factories overseas to China. America gave all its expertise and technology to China. America started to educate the Chinese elite. And what's really important is American defense companies started to give military secret technology to China. Now I know that in the United States, people believe that China stole this technology. China didn't have to steal this technology because America gave it to China for free. Okay? Why would America do this? To create dependence on America. Because once the dependence is created, then Chinese will want US dollars. The intention has always been to create a market for US dollars in order to prop up the US currency. Does that make sense? So Saudi Arabia gave its oil to the United States, and China gave its labor, its most precious commodity, to the United States in exchange for US dollars. All right, so why is this important? Let's look at the case of Japan. The year is 1985. And this is what we call the Placer Court. The Placer Court was between the central bankers and the finance ministries of different nations, but probably between the United States and Japan. Japan at this point was an export powerhouse. It was the second largest economy in the world. High savings rate. People really didn't want to buy American goods, but Americans love Japanese goods. So it was creating this trade imbalance. and Japan was growing and becoming a powerhouse. So America said to Japan, listen, you guys need to restructure your economy because your consumers aren't spending any money. This creates trade imbalance and ultimately this will lead to structural problems in Japan. So what we're gonna do is we will revalue the Japanese currency. We will appreciate it against the US dollar. So as Japanese consumers, you're able to buy more from the United States. Now Japanese economists thought this was a terrible idea, but because America has military bases in Japan, Japan didn't even have a choice that matter, right? And so this created the Japanese explosion of wealth. So they were by Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, and this created a fair of Japan in the United States. So to demonstrate to you how ridiculous the situation was, in the year 1990, in Kyoto, the imperial grounds, I'm not talking about the city of Kyoto, I'm talking about the imperial grounds in Kyoto. That land by itself was worth more than Canada as a country. You could sell the imperial grounds of Kyoto and go by Canada for yourself. That's how ridiculous the situation was in Japan. Because of the appreciation of the yen, Cheap money flooded into the nation of Japan and so people were speculating on real estate in the stock market, okay, which led to ultimately economic collapse in Japan. So as you can see, from the 60s up until about the 90s, Japanese growth was pretty strong, but after the Plastic Accord, you saw a steep drop, okay? The Plastic Accord, by preaching in the yen, by giving Japanese easy money, it destroyed the Japanese economy. All right, so remember this. If you want to nuke an economy in a nation, if you really want to destroy an economy in a nation, give them easy money. All right? If I want to destroy you as a person, I'm gonna give you a million dollars because you're gonna take that million dollars and do stupid things with it, okay? Oh, okay, yeah. What does easy money mean? Easy money just means that you think it's free. You don't have to work for it, you don't have to earn it, okay? And the idea of easy money is, central banks have a power to print money. So if you come to me, I'm on bank, I can actually just give you a million dollars and you take it, that's easy money, right? Okay, that's the idea, okay? So you don't understand this, it's a hard concept to understand, but banks have that power, they can just put money out of nothing, and this is what we call easy money. And what this leads to is disaster, okay? So let's go over the list of how easy money destroys nations. First is that it turns manufacturers into financial speculators. The reason why is, maybe you're a car company, okay? And before you're making good money, making cars and selling to the Americans. But if the economy is blowing up, the start market is increasing, the real estate market is increasing, you're actually better off taking all your savings, your investments and put it into the start market. Right, because you have better returns. And as a corporation, you have to guarantee better returns for your investors. Okay? It makes people lazy, selfish and greedy. That's easy to understand, right? If someone just gave you $1,000, you would not wanna work or study ever again in your life. You create too much debt too quickly. You create financial bubbles, corruption between the politicians and the financial elite. You create massive inequality, right? Because it's usually the wealthy who most benefit from this wealth generation. You increase unemployment and bankruptcies. And the last thing that's really important is because of all this surge in prices, you price up young people and you destroy the nation's future. You look at the birth rate in Japan. It's about one. Okay? Japanese young people do not see a future for themselves. How is it too expensive? The jobs don't pay that well, okay? Any questions before I continue? Is this fair? Okay. All right, let's continue. But it's not just Japan. It's also, it's a 1997 Asia financial crisis. Remember, this is when South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, their currencies were under attack. And because your currencies were under attack, they became devalued. The problem with this is, before this, Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea had access to EC money provided by central banks. And so they could afford to buy things overseas, invest things overseas. But once the currency was devalued, they now went bankrupt. And as a result, the National Monetary Fund was able to step in and prioritize the central banks. So that's a playbook. All right, 1989 is important because that's when the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union and communism came to an end. Now it's the Pax Americana, okay? And then the Pax Americana, the system is, America would ship its manufacturing overseas. Remember, manufacturing was a source of middle class wealth generation. Now it's shipping all its manufacturing overseas to focus on financialization. So the idea is that Wall Street would take all this money, all this wealth being generated overseas, and then take it back to America and use it to invest in America to basically engage in financial games. Does that make sense? So in other words, before America was manufacturing things like cars and washing machines, now America is a scambling. The entire economy is based on gambling anymore. And this will lead to something called the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, where the global economy collapses basically. 2001, 1911, the Wall Street Center, right? The terrorist attacks. Again, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, so I'm not going to go into the conspiracies behind this. But it led to something called the War on Terror, where America, for no particular reason, went to Iraq, Syria, Libya and destroyed these countries. Now if you're a conspiracy theorist, you would say, well they destroyed these countries because these countries didn't have central banks. So that's what some people say, I would not say that, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. 2008 is the great financial crisis. What had happened? It happened because America had become a gambling economy. And so it had to take money and invest it. The problem though is there's too much money flowing into America and there's not enough good investments. So what Washi did was it started to invest in really bad investments. It was encouraging people with no money to go and buy like five houses, okay? And eventually they would have to default. And when they default, it would create a cascading effect where the entire global economy would collapse. And that's what was the 2008 great financial crisis. To solve this problem, what America did was print money. Look at this, guys. Up until the year 1980, America had about $20 in debt. America was found in 1776. By the year 1980, about 28 years later, it had $20 in debt. Today, it has now $37 in debt. This is all money printing. Starting about 2008, boom. You see a steep curve going all the way up. All right? The economy in America right now is really screwed up. The reason why is the stock market is worth twice as much as the real economy. Okay, that makes no sense at all. The total value of the US economy is half of that of the stock market. Okay, so this shows you that right now America is living in a fantasy. It's a make-believe economy. The other problem is this massive wealth inequality. So as you can see, the wealthy people are pretty wealthy. But by 1980, the time of Reagan, it shoots all the way up. So you have this massive wealth inequality being created in the United States. This also shows you how wealthy the top 0,01% are relative to everyone else. So the main beneficiaries of all these reforms of this financial has been the ultra-welfie in America. At the same time, if you're an average American, all you've seen is your debt go up. Your debt has gone way up. So you can make the argument that the system is designed to exploit the middle class by forcing it into debt so as to enrich the wealthy's investments. That's the American system. And in fact, you can argue the global system. So 2008, the global economy collapses. So what happens, I believe this is what happened. I don't think this is conspiracy theory. Central banks basically encourage the Chinese central bank to start printing money. Right? And this is important because when you start printing money and you invest in real estate, you need resources. You need to buy resources from Australia, from Brazil. And this is what saves the global economy. And this all looks very impressive, guys. Like I know when you go outside and you see all these big buildings and fancy railways, it's all very impressive. But remember, okay? This is really important. Behind the veneer of this prosperity are three things. Massive debt, right? Because this money's being printed. So someone has to pay this all. You guys, not the current people, but you guys or your grandchildren, or your great-grandchildren, okay? But someone has to pay all this debt. That's number one. Number two is, this has created massive inequality in China, right? So the rich are filthy rich, and the poor aren't that much better off. Now third problem that's really important is, it's created a lot of corruption. All right? So behind all this veneer are corruption, inequality, and debt. And this is what, okay? So a really important lesson for you guys to understand the Chinese relationship with America is this. There's this very famous quote by Charles Baudier who said, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. Okay? Well, I'm going to paraphrase him, okay? And this is what I think is the relationship between America and China. The greatest trick America played was convincing China it could be rich. There's no difference from 1985, the plastic wards, when America basically encouraged the Japanese to increase the value of their yen, which led to academic collapse. Well, when Americans encouraged the Chinese print money in about 2008 and about 2015, it basically created conditions for China's academic collapse. Okay? All right, this is what led to the rise of this man, our dear fearless leader. I believe his intentions are good. I think he wants to save China from this global financial capitalist system. He needs to maintain China's independence and sovereignty. And he's fighting very hard to save the Chinese nation. That's what I believe. And so you can make the argument that what's happening today in China is no different from the open wars. Remember, Britain created an opium epidemic in China in order to enslave the Chinese economy to the global financial system. That was the opium wars. Well, the same is happening today where the Americans have basically created a Chinese dependency on US dollars. What's the Chinese dream? The Chinese dream is work hard, get into a good school, get rich, move your money and your children to the United States. That's the Chinese dream. And if that's a dream, then eventually, the civilization won't last very long. Am I wrong? Is that not the Chinese dream? All right. So now you have the COVID crisis, where China's locked down for three years. Now, I'm not conspiracy theorist, okay? But you can make the argument that some of this was intentional in order to implode the Chinese economy. Why? Because the Chinese economy had become a system of transferring wealth from China to United States. So if by imploding the economy, you're stopping this drainage, okay? All right, this also led to the rise of this man, Vladimir Putin, who is very much like Joseph Stalin. He understands the grand picture. He understands strategy, grand strategy. He understands that now it's time to strike. Why? Because America has created this crazy fantastical system where there's a hierarchy of prices. In the American system, the Paxa Americana, maybe resources are the least valuable. The basis of the resources, right? Which is what Russia has a lot of. Up next in this pyramid is manufacturing, which is what China does. Then up next is knowledge economy. So professionals, and that's what Europe and America does really well. Okay. And at the very top of this pyramid are the financiers, finance. And that's what Wall Street dominates. Okay. So this is the pyramid of the world that we live in. What Putin said is this, what Putin said is, you know what? If I can control the world's resources, the oil, the food, then I can invert this pyramid so that we sort of resource at the top. And that's why Russia invaded Ukraine. Because if Russia were able to dominate Ukraine, Russian and Ukraine together would control one third, one third of the world's carbohydrates. Well, Russian food, Africa and the Middle East would both starve to death. And so that is the rationale for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. He's a genius, he understands that's fundamental weakness in the American system. If you're able to control the resources, you are able to strangle this financial system. So by invading Ukraine, Putin shows that America is a paper tiger. Faith in the USD rests on the aura of the American military's inability and invincibility. This now forces the Americans to invade Iran. Does that make sense to you guys? The logic here is very simple. Why does Saudi Arabia buy US dollars, even though they know it's not worth anything? Why does Japan buy US dollars? But it's Germany. The answer is they're afraid that if they don't buy US dollars, America will come and invade them. Okay? They have no choice in the matter. But now that Pune show that actually you know what, the American military is not as strong as you think it is. The American military now has no choice but to prove it is as strong as people believe. It needs to restore faith in the military in order to restore faith in the US dollar. Okay? Does that make sense? That's why the American military has no choice in the matter but to invade Iran. Okay? Why? Because if they're able to invade Iran, they're able to control the entire flow of Mino-e's oil. Also, they're able to control the active trade throughout the world. Okay? Iran is really the center of the world in terms of global trade. So these two factors mean that America needs to eventually invade Iran. All right, once it invades Iran, it creates a huge problem for China and Japan and South Korea. Why? Because guess what? These three nations get most of this oil from the Middle East, right? Japan imports roughly 89% of its oil from the Middle East. And guess what, guys? Japan is the largest buyer of US dollars. So if Japan ever says, you know what, screw this, we're not buying US dollars, the American economy goes bankrupt. So when you invade Iran, you control the oil supply, you control the entire Japanese economy. You can charge whatever price you want for oil. All right, this explains the Israel-Pashtian conflict because Americans just can't go invade Iran for no reason, it needs a pretext. The perfect pretext is Israel comes in conflict with Iran, Iran attacks Israel, the United States must now defend Israel because Israel is its ally, right? Does that make sense? So America needs a scapegoat. That scapegoat is Israel. That explains why there's so much conflict right now in the Middle East. Look at this map, okay? This is Iran. It's surrounded by American bases. You have 14,000 troops in Afghanistan. You've got like thousands more over here, okay? Iran is surrounded. It seems to me that America's been preparing to invade Iran for the past 20 years. It's just looking for the perfect opportunity. All right, problem though is that Iran is not an adversary that America can defeat. The reason why is the geography of Iran. Look at this. In 2003, America went to Iraq and destroyed Iraq. Why? Iraq's a desert. It's flat plains. America has bombs. It has fighter planes, right? It's pretty easy to destroy a desert. But Iran, Iran is all mountains. These fighter planes do no good against mountains. You can't bomb a mountain into submission. So if America were to invade Iran, there's very little chance that America would win this war. In fact, it may be the end of the American Empire. And Putin has a plan. Putin is a genius. He knows exactly what will happen. So Putin is preparing for this possible invasion of Iran. So this is a really important picture. Putin signed an agreement with Kim Jong-un. The agreement is something called a mutual defense pact, which means that if North Korea is ever attacked, Putin will come to his aid. All right? Now why would Putin do this? This is really strange. The answer is this. The answer is if America attacks Iran, he needs to throw America off balance by creating conflict somewhere else. The best place to create a conflict would be Southeast Asia, right? Now you would think, we don't make it here. Putin and China are best friends. If America invades Iran, then China may invade Taiwan. But, I already told you this, China is dependent on the American economy, so I do not believe this will happen. And Putin is fairly certain this won't happen either. That's why he's our best friends with Kim Jong-un. Because Kim Jong-un, if he were to menace South Korea, That would throw the American military off balance. Because now there is war on three fronts. Ukraine, South North Korea, and Iran. That's the grand strategy of Putin. This is his trump card. Does that make sense? All right. Now, what I'm saying here is this. I'm saying, I know there's an archaic now between China and America. There's a trade war going on. But I think this will pass. I think there will be an approach meant between China and America because both economies are dependent on each other. So I think the friendship between Putin and China won't last very long. There's also really a lot of geopolitical reasons why this friendship won't last very long. Because China and Russia have a lot of geopolitical conflicts. They share a border. They're trying to fight for influence in Central Asia. There's lots of reasons why in the long term, China and Russia eventually have to break apart, which means that Putin now sees his best friend could be Germany, okay? This I think are gonna be the two big geopolitical surprises in the next five years. First of all, America and China become best friends or not best friends, but they'll have a rapprochement. And then Germany and Russia will have a rapprochement. Okay? All right. So Donald Trump, President of the United States, he wants a third term, okay? He's creating, everything he's doing right now is because he wants to be king of the United States. He wants a third term, okay, for a variety of reasons. I won't go into many reasons, okay? But he's not narcissistic. He has to solve a problem. This problem is the national debt, right? It's about $37 trillion. You can't pay this off. You can never pay this off. But the theory is, the theory is like, as long as you are the greatest military in the world, as long as you can go invade everyone, you don't have to pay this off. You can constantly increase this debt. That's the theory. This explains the US-China trade war. Everything that we're seeing today is because Donald Trump needs to come to an agreement with China for a variety of reasons. The first reason is Trump wants to invade Iran and so he needs to be on good terms with China. Another reason is he needs people to buy US dollars. And right now there's a lot of financial repression in China, meaning that you can't convert Chinese currency into US currency. American investors aren't allowed to come to China and buy up the Chinese financial system. Trump wants China to open up. Trump needs to create more interdependency between China and the United States. And that's why for Trump, Chinese citizens and students in America, it's the ultimate leverage point in negotiations. Ask yourself, why this happening? Why is it that your visas are being threatened? You wanna go to the United States and spend a lot of money to get American education. But Trump is saying, no, no, no, we get to go to your visa. Why is this happening? It's all part of negotiation. There's no way that America will shut out Chinese students because America needs that money. Well, without Chinese spending money in America, while Chinese wanting to purchase US dollars, the American economy will collapse. So there's no way that America will close its door to Chinese students. But it needs China to open up its economy furthermore to create more interdependency, to save the US dollar. All right. So where am I getting these ideas? Am I just making this stuff up? So in this class what you're taught is that history tends to repeat itself and by studying history meticulously and thoroughly we can get insight into the future. So what I want to show you now is there's a direct analogy between what's happening today and what happened in Greece in about 400 BC, okay? This is and he wrote a very famous book called The History of the Peloponnesian War, which is what we discussed last semester. Now, the Peloponnesian War is a war between Athens and Sparta for hegemony on the Greek mainland. So in 480, Athens and Sparta were best friends. They fought against Persia, which was invading the Greek mainland. And at the Battle of Salamis, the Athenians basically destroyed the Persian navy. and the Persians were forced to retreat. But there's always a threat that Persians over here would come back and invade Athens and Sparta, okay? As well, throughout the Aegean Sea are Greek islands and colonies that are afraid of Persian hegemony. So after the feet of the Persians, the Athenians got together with these colonies and it creates something called the Deleon League. The Deleon League is like NATO, it's a defensive alliance. The Persians attack, then this alliance will defend together against the Persians. Now, the Athenians have the best navy at this time, and the other islands are like, you know, we don't have a navy, but what we'll do is this, we'll give you our gold, okay? So, to all these islands, they put all their wealth on a place called Delos. This is why we have the Delian League name, okay? And this money is meant as a mutual defense fund. You're not supposed to touch it until unless the person's invade, in which case you use this money to defend against the person, okay? That's the idea. And this worked out well until the Finians stole the money, right? Why? Because they wanted to create something called a Parthenon, okay? Which is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. And within the building, it's the statue of Athena. It's pure gold. So the Athenians stole all this money from Delos, from their allies, and they built this Parthenon, and the Wulfi were able to steal from the Parthenon in the construction process. And so the citizens of Athens became really Wulfi. It's easy money, right? And remember, easy money destroys a society. And so this is what led to the Peloponian War, because after Athens stole this money, it didn't apologize to its allies. In fact, it forced its allies to continue to pay tribute to Athens. Athens became a mafia state, a protection racket. If you don't give us the money, they will come invade you. And so these allies started to encourage Sparta to attack Athens, and that's what led to the Peloponian War. So there are three major incidents from the Peloponian War that I want us to focus on. The first incident is in 428 BCE, a place called Metalin, an island. They were a former Athenian ally who refused to pay tribute. So Athenians invaded and conquered it. And another question is, what do you do now? How do you teach these guys a lesson? How do you ensure this doesn't happen again? So one faction in Athens said, let's kill all the men. Pretty simple, right? Let's kill all the men. And then we'll spread fear among our allies. and no one will rebel against it anymore. So they have a debate and all the students say, let's kill them all. So they send a trireme, a ship to the island, and you give the orders to the Athenian soldiers to kill everyone. Well, not everyone, but the men, and enslave the woman and the children. Okay? But after the debate, the Athenians started to talk amongst themselves and a lot of them couldn't sleep. And they're like, this is wrong. We're Athenians. We are a democracy. We fight for freedom and liberty. We can't do this to our allies. So the very next morning, the Athenian citizens get together and says, we have another debate and we're gonna discuss what to do. And so they have this huge debate and they says, no, we're Athenians, we're virtuous. We will not do this. So they send another trireme to catch up to the first trireme. And remember, the first trireme is way ahead, right? They have days of journey ahead. So the other triremes, they ask the off to catch up to the first triremes, and at the very last minute they catch up. And they tell the soldiers not to kill the men, okay? And so this is the conflict between democracy and empire. Now let's fast forward to 416. And now another thing happens where the Athenians are losing this war against the Spartans. It's costing them a lot of money. They're forced to melt down the Satcho Athena, the goddess, and used to go to pay for this this war. Okay? And so and so their attitude changes and now they're completely a mafia state. They don't care about democracy, they don't care about virtue. All they want is for the allies to pay tribute. Okay? So they go invade an island called Melos. And Melos is not part of this war. They're not part of Sparta. They're not part of Athens They're just neutral and then the Athenians said we don't care you pay tribute to us Okay, they're basically like a mafia racket now and the millennium say we we're neutral You have to respect our neutrality and the Athenians say in response Right as the world goes is only in question between equals and power While the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must So 12 years later, they think it's like screw virtue, screw democracy, screw liberty, just give us money. So remember this idea. Athenians wanted the trappings of empire. They also wanted to feel virtuous. And over time, as Athens became more poor, they were like screw virtue, let's have an empire. And that's why in 415, Akhaba 80s, who basically is a Trump of Athens at this time, He says to the Indian people, hey guys, we're losing this war against Sparta, but don't worry. Let's go invade more territory. Okay, so they decided to go invade Sicily, which was very wealthy. The problem though is that Sicily is pretty far away, okay? Remember this is Athens, they're fighting this huge war in the agency against the Spartans, and they're gonna go and invade Sicily for its money, okay, and it's pretty far away. And it's not really well thought out. They don't really think about how to resupply the soldiers, and eventually their expedition gets wiped out at Syracuse. Okay? So it's a disaster for the Athenians, and it turns the war in favor of the Spartans. Athens is so bad that everyone gets together, the entire world gets together to destroy Athens. The Persians, the Persians were the enemies of both Sparta and Athens, right? The Persians start to finance the Spartans, and the Spartans eventually lay siege to Athens and defeat the Athenians. So why is this important? Well, because history is going to repeat itself. There's going to be a lot of similarities between the Persian-Peloponnese War and the American Empire today. First similarity is NATO. Remember, the Athenians had the Dalian League and the Americans have NATO. And NATO is meant to be a defensive alliance. But if that's the case, then why is it that the Nord Stream pipeline got destroyed? When the Nord Stream pipeline, it sends cheap gas from Russia to Germany. The Germany economy is used cheap Russian resources, primarily gas, manufacturing the best cars in the world and sell to China. But because of this war in Ukraine, America not only limited, basically embargoed Russian gas to Germany, which destroyed the Russian economy, but some people even say that America's destroyed the pipeline. Okay, so the Americans are attacking their own allies. Trump has said that America should take over Greenland and Canada. Why? Because they're wealthy, they have lots of resources and also they don't have really strong militaries. Trump, he's like a mafia godfather. America's behaving like a mafia system today. Now, what America is doing, it's forcing Europe to rearm itself. So this is Germany and Germany, Britain, France, they've all announced this huge military budget. And so you're like, okay, does this mean that we'll have World War III? Well, America doesn't think like that. America isn't like, you know, like, let's fight Russia. America is like, how can we exploit our allies further? And so you can make the argument that this is not really about fighting the Russians. It's really about getting their allies, France, Germany, and Britain, to buy expensive and crappy American weapons. Remember the military industrial complex, right? The entire point is not to fight the Russians. The Russians are just a pretext and excuse. The real purpose is to get the Europeans to buy expensive American weapons. It's really a shakedown. Okay? All right. So all around the world, there's protests about what's happening in the Middle East. Right? These are huge protests, protesting what's happening in Gaza today. But ultimately, it's not gonna matter. All right? Why? Because America is an empire. It's a mafia state. It needs to destroy Iran in order to maintain its power. Okay? Americans want the trappings of empire, they also want to feel virtuous. That's why there's conflict right now. Over time, as America becomes poorer and poorer and more and more desperate, this virtue will go away and the raw brutal power of America will express itself throughout the world. And this will eventually lead to us, lead us to the final conflict, the war between Iran and the United States. Iran has been preparing for a long time. ever since 1979. America's been preparing for a long time. This conflict is World War III. I cannot overstate how brutal this conflict will be. It will lead to fundamental changes in the world. Our lives will never be the same again. Everything that we've known in the past is now gone forever and we have to prepare for a new future. So I leave you with a message, okay? I know that this class has been depressing. You've been with me for a year now. It's been very depressing, okay? Because we've gone into the heart of darkness of humanity. And I know that the world looks more and more terrible. But remember this, okay? and this is my final message to you. Remember this, the greatest minds of humanity, which include Homer, Dante, Emmanuel Cod, they've all told us this, they've all told us one secret of the universe, one message, which is this, the imagination is the animating force of the universe. Love is the unifying force of the universe. What this means is this, what this means is that in the darkest times when all hope has been lost, When there's only the spear, any of us, you, me, you, any one of us can rise up, stand up, and be the light to lead humanity forward. Okay? And that's the task ahead of us if we are to save humanity in this darkest of times. Okay? So remember this, we all have the capacity to imagine, we all have the capacity to love. That's what makes us human. In the worst times, we must defend our own humanity. So that is it. Thank you so much."}

So as you know, there's been a ceasefire announced in the Middle East and many of you are curious as to what this ceasefire means. Well, I still believe that the United States, Israel, and Iran are fully committed to war and And the ceasefire, it's really about attempting to shape the narrative around this war, trying to control the terms, trying to determine how the war will be fought. So for Iran, for the Ayatollah, it's very important that the Iranian people understand that Iran is forced into this war. In his speech to the Iranian people, right after the U.S. bombing, He created the economy between Iran and the United States. Iran is a nation dedicated to peace. United States is a nation dedicated to war. The Iranian people live the truth. The American people tell the lie. And the Iranian people will do all it can to achieve peace. But it forced to defend sovereignty, it forced to defend their faith, and the Iranian people will fight to the death. The Iranian people will never surrender. But if an opportunity for peace presents itself, then the Iranian people, the Iranian nation, the Atola, will grasp that opportunity. did launch the attacks against Iran, but he's trying to create the narrative that this is happening not because this is what he wants, but because he's forced to do so by the globalists, by the deep state, by the American Empire. He himself is a person who only aspires for world peace. But these warmongers, these neocons within his administration who are embedded in the deep state and who have tentacles all around the world, they are undermining him and forcing him to act against Iran. But he will fight for the American people. He will fight for world peace. And that's why he is trying as hard as he can to broker a peace deal between Israel and Iran. Both Trump and the Atolla can do this, can try to be the peacemakers because they know that Nanyahu will continue to push for war, that Israel will continue to be the aggressor in this war. So Israel is really the skip-goat, but it's really important for us to understand that all three leaders, Trump, the Atalah, and Nanyahu are committed to war for different reasons. So in today's talk, I want to explain to you what really driving these three individuals, why are they committed to war, and what do they want from this war. And for us to understand this, I want to introduce to you a new concept. It's called the Mesanic Calling. Each of these individuals, Trump, the Al-Tola, and Nanyahu, see themselves as historical, mezzanic figures. They are on a mission from God to save the world, to save their people, to deliver their people into the Promised Land. And if we need to understand that this is ultimately what's driving them, not fame, not power, nothing but this measinic calling. That's what's really driving them. So let me explain what this measinic calling is by explaining to you it's three major characteristics. The first major characteristic is that when you truly believe that you are an omission from God, that you are the chosen one, that you are the prophet, that God smiles on you. You have access to divine energy. What is divine energy? Let me give you an example. Maybe you're a mother and you're taking your three-year-old into the forest. You get lost and you're wandering the woods and then suddenly a black bear pounces on you. Well, as a mother, what's going to happen is, and you could be petite, you could be weak. What's gonna happen is you suddenly, when your child is under attack, under threat, you will find unlimited energy, strength, and courage to fight off this bear and you will succeed. And we know because there's been a couple of anecdotes like this. So a mother's love for a child is one of the strongest forces in the world. Now, to understand about energy, just multiply this mother's love for her child by about a million. And you can understand how energized, how motivated, how powerful people with the medicine and calling feels. The classic example is Trump, right? So Trump, during the campaign season, he would get about like four or five hours in the morning, do a lot of tweets, watch a lot of TV, He would get on his plane and go to a campaign rally where he would talk endlessly for a couple of hours. Then he would get back on the plane and then fly somewhere else and do another rally. And then he would do another rally for the 50,000 people. And then he would watch the news and then he'd go to bed, sleep soundly and get the next morning to do it again for two, three, four months. And you have to ask yourself, why is he so energetic? He's 79. Why is he so motivated? I mean, he's not in the best health in the world because he eats McDonald's all the time and he's clearly obese for his age. But none of this matters because his faith in his mission, the fact that he knows that he's been chosen by God to complete his mission. That fills him with an infinite energy, and that's where his strength comes from. The second characteristic of people who are filled with the Mesiac Calling is that they are absolutely fearless. They know that because God has chosen them, God will protect them. And so no bullets can harm them. Okay, so Trump, so the classic example again is Trump. He was almost assassinated at Butler, Pennsylvania. And remember how even though the bullet came close to him, he was still able to get up and pump his fists and shout to the people, fight, fight, fight. Okay, this is absolute They know that God will always protect them. But also, even if they were to die, they would go straight to heaven and be with God. They're one of the elect. And then finally, their bodies, none of them matter. Their bodies are just vessels for this divine energy to be transplanted on earth. When they die, when their vessel, this vessel breaks, and it fills the followers with divine energy as well. They become martyrs and their followers will complete the mission on their behalf. So they've transcended death, they've transcended this material world. They are now ideas, they are now faith, they're now inspiration for their followers and And so therefore they are immortal, they are internal, and they are invincible. The third characteristic of people with Meso-Nicoling is the persecution complex. The idea is how do you know that you are one of the elect? How do you know that God has chosen you? It's because society, the world, everyone around you persecutes you. So again, the classic example is Trump. Trump survived two impeachments. In his first term, the deep state filled his cabinet, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Nikki Haley. Everyone was part of the deep state and they undermined him. In fact, your generals brag about how they intentionally disobeyed Trump's orders. In fact, you had one general, Mark Milley, who told the Chinese government, don't listen to Trump. He's not really in charge. If you have any issues, call us directly. So they were undermining him. The media, every day, was embasting him, cursing him. The whole world was cursing him or laughing at him. The European elite was laughing at him. Remember when Trump was talking about the Nord Stream pipeline and how it would cause German dependency on Russian oil? Those German ambassadors were at the back of the nations, just laughing their heads off at Trump. After he left office, Trump had to survive law fear, Law fear, right? They raided his home at Merrill-Lago. They tried to bankrupt him. They tried to form him in prison for extremely spurious offenses. So, Trump feels he's persecuted, but that's good for him. That energizes him because it makes him feel that God is testing him. God wants to know, do you truly believe in your mission? Are you truly committed to your mission? And through this persecution process, Trump will develop more and more faith, more strength, more power. This divine energy is filling him and this divine energy will allow him to fulfill his mission. Let's look at the Ayatollah. Right now, the world's most sophisticated intelligence agency, Mossad, is hunting him. They want to assassinate him. They make a military, the most powerful military in human history, with their precision bombs, with their satellite technology. They're hunting the Atolia as well. And the Atolia is 86. So given all this, how does the Atolia feel right now? And the answer is, he feels ecstatic. He's never been more alive. He's never been more energetic. He's never felt more vibrant in his life. He feels as though the moment he's been waiting for all his life, the moment he's dreamt of all his life, the opportunity to kill the great Satan, it is now before him. And so he's not going to die. And if you ask him to go to the marathon tomorrow, he could do so. That's the power of divine energy combined with the persecution complex. Netanyahu is the same situation. Netanyahu, his country, Israel, it's divided. There are all these corruption charges against him and his family. And right now, as long as he's in office, he's immune from these charges. But the moment that this war stops, then he would face corruption charges and he would probably be thrown in prison. He's not faced by any of this. He knows that this persecution, it's all a sign that God favors him. And this persecution will ultimately give him the strength, the faith to fulfill his divine mission on earth. So now what I want to talk about is, what exactly is a divine mission? How do each individual perceive their divine mission? So I'll start with the adatola because that's very simple. The Persians, their belief system is a combination of Zoroastrianism as well as Shia Muslim. Zoroastrianism is the world's first eschatological religion and in it is a moral clarity. The world is divided between good and evil, between light and dark, between the truth and the lie. And this is the very structure of the cosmos. And these two forces have not war since the beginning of time. Eventually, these forces will meet in a final climatic battle. And at this point, we humans, we must make the decision as to what force to join. Will we fight for the side of good, or will we fight for the side of evil? And clearly, the Atollah believes that he must unite the Muslim world and have them fight on the side of good against the great evil, the great Satan, which is the United States and their vassal state, Israel. The Shia Muslim religion is one that believes that suffering, persecution, and sacrifice, it's all part of your faith. If you truly believe, then you will suffer and you will sacrifice yourself. So the Adetola is willing to die for what he believes in. He's willing to die for his faith. That for him would be the greatest honor. So the Adetola, what he wants, it's pretty clear. He wants to lure the great Satan into Iran. He wants to lure the great Satan into his lair where he will take his flaming sword and stab the great Satan to death. Thus freeing his people from oppression, from persecution, from suffering. And by killing the great Satan, he will save his people and save the world. So that's the divine mission of the Ayatollah. Donald Trump, what is his divine mission? Well, he wants to make America great again. So why is America not great? The reason why is, for the past hundred years, America has been co-opted by the globalists. And America has been forced to engage in these forever wars in the Middle East that has killed thousands of good American soldiers. And this was done at the behest of the globalists. These globalists have also forced open American borders and let in millions and millions of illegal immigrants in order to corrupt America, in order to destroy civil society in America. These globalists also have in a school curriculum, infested the teachings of young children with multiculturalism, with work politics, with DEI, diversity, inclusion, equity, these ideas. So these ideas, globalism, liberalism and multiculturalism are cancers on the body of the American Republic. And you can't negotiate with cancers. You can't wait for cancers to die out. You must purge these cancers from the body of the American Republic with blood and fire. So the divine mission for Trump is to destroy the American Empire by enrolling it into an unwindable war against Iran. But not only that, but to compel the American people to rise up against their globalist oppressors and overthrow them, to remove America from the world, and to achieve its manifest destiny, which is basically control over North America, which is the promised land, which is what God promised to the Americans. And once America recognized that it should not interfere in global fears, Europe, Asia, Africa, who cares, they're hopeless. Once America is able to restore its Republican soul and spirit, then America will be great again. And Donald Trump, his mission is to lead the American people in the revolution against the global elite and to restore the American Republic. That's Donald Trump. Then you have Benjamin Netanyahu. For Benjamin Netanyahu, like many, many Israelis, they believe that the golden age of the Jewish people was the Kingdom of David, which which occurred about 3,000 years ago. That was when Israel, the nation, was free, independent, unified, and supreme in the Middle East. It was a time of peace and prosperity for the world. But after the Kingdom of David collapsed, Israel has been attacked by its neighbors and has been dismembered and has become a vassal state. First, the Syrians and Babylonians came to dismember Israel. Then Israel became a vassal state to the Persians. Then after the Persians came the Ptolemy's of Egypt and after that were the Seleucid Empire. The Jews were able to rebel against the Seleucid Empire and establish the reign of the Maccabees, but that didn't last very long because the Romans came right after that. And the Romans were brutal. The Romans killed many, many Jews and they exiled the Jews from Jerusalem. Their place of worship and they destroyed the second temple. So the Romans were actually brutal. In the seventh century, the Sama Caliphate, We stored the Jews to Jerusalem, but they were still not masters of their own land. So the entire project of Israel is to return to the glory days of the Kingdom of David. And now is a historical opportunity to achieve that. The only opposition against re-establishing the Kingdom of David is Iran and the United States. And if both can be destroyed in a cataclysmic war, then you will have the restoration of the Kingdom of David. Israel will be a unified nation again. All Jews can now return to Israel, and Israel can be the light of all nations, which which is what the nation aspires to. Of course, this raises a really interesting question. For the Empire of Israel to be born, the Empire of America needs to be destroyed. So why would America just sit back and let this happen? Why would the global elite allow for Israel to become dominant in the Middle East? Remember the center of global trade is the Middle East. Most of the world's oil is in the Middle East. Well I think Israel will achieve its ambition. And the reason why is there are certain elements of the American Empire. certain elements of the global elite that want the kingdom of David to be restored. They want the American Empire to be destroyed and to leave the Middle East. They want to help Netanyahu achieve his men's ethnic calling. These elements are what we can loosely call Christian dynasties. believe that for Jesus to return the nation of Israel has to be reconstituted. They have to rebuild their temple and they have to call back all the Jews from around the world and that's be a final battle between Israel and the world. And they believe that it is their message calling to make this prophecy happen. And you hear this and you think this is all really silly, but let me tell you two things. The first thing is this plan, this prophecy has been in place for centuries. This Christian Zionist project has been around ever since the Protestant Reformation. And these people have been patiently planning and waiting for today. That's the first thing. The second thing you need to know is there's a man who actually conceived this Christian Zionist project, who built the intellectual foundations for Christian Zionism. And this man, you know his name, but you may not really know who he is. His name is Isaac Newton. And you know that, yeah, he is the founder of calculus, and he conceived the foundations for classical mechanics in physics. But you don't know who the real historical Isaac Newton is. The real historical Isaac Newton saw himself as a prophet with a message and calling to understand the mind of God and to prepare for the return of Jesus. And as you probably know, Isaac Newton was a very, very smart man. So in my next video, I'm going to talk about the real historical Isaac Newton and what his plan is. Because once you understand all this, then what's happening in the Middle East makes a lot more sense."}

Welcome to our first class. And today what I want to do is provide the framework for how we will learn the semester. What are we learning? How are we learning? Why are we learning? Alright, so this is a class of ideas. So it's really important for you to pay attention and understand how these ideas connect with each other. If I'm not being clear, ask me a question. In fact, make it a habit to ask as many questions as possible because that way you will learn more, learning will be more fun for you, and learning will be much more clearer to you, okay? So it's going to have a habit of asking questions. So wherever I am confusing, wherever I'm speaking too fast, wherever you don't understand, interrupt me, okay? Let's get in the habit. All right. So I first want to talk about Emmanuel Kant. We will be discussing him a lot this semester because he is the greatest philosopher in Western history. And he teaches us, he taught us how the world works. And this is what he told us. He told us that we can never know the objective reality. There is an objective reality, what he calls the nominah, okay? Or the things in themselves. That is not knowable to us. That is a world we can never access. Why? Because we perceive the world through our senses. Our senses, our perception warps the world and changes it into a structure that we can process called the phenomena, which are the things that appear to us. Okay, so the example is time and space. Time and space do not exist outside of us. Time and space do not exist in reality. But for us to understand reality, we need to add in time and space. That's the example. All right? So how the word works is we perceive the world, we perceive the phenomena and turn it into the phenomena for us to process. In other words, and this is really important, reality is what we imagine it to be. There is no objective reality. is what we imagine it to be. Life is a constant process, a constant act of imagination. All right? That's Emmanuel Kant. That's the first idea I want you to understand. So what I want to do in this class this semester is train you or teach you or inspire you to augment your imagination so that you see the world much more clearly. This class is not about what to think, it's about how to think. All right, all right. So, let me explain the structure of the course. So there's past, there's present, and there's future. We'll be looking at all three this semester, the past, the present, and the future. We were analyzing all three in order to construct a more objective reality for ourselves. We will not succeed, we will fail. But the process of trying will train our minds to think much more critically about the world. So, let me explain how. In the present, we have geopolitics. We will be studying geopolitics. For example, why is there war in Ukraine? Why is there war in the Middle East? What will happen? We'll be studying geopolitics and we'll try to understand why this is happening. We'll try to formulate an analytical model of geopolitics, okay, an analytical model. We will then use this analytical model to make predictions about the future. Why do we do this? Because these predictions will tell us if our Anical Model is correct or not. Okay, does that make sense? It's no different from artificial intelligence. How do you know if your artificial intelligence, the model is correct or not? When you test it against reality. Okay, there's no difference between that artificial intelligence system and what we're trying to do here. And why are we doing this? Because if we're able to have an Anical Model that makes correct predictions, then we take all this and go back and analyze the past to reveal the secret history of the world. That is a project we are undertaking this semester to discover for ourselves the secret history of humanity because you may not know this, but all the history that you learn in school, all that history that you think you know it is false. The history that you know, the history that you believe, it is a system implanted into your brains by powerful people. So the real question that we're looking at this semester is really how does power work? Because if we can figure this out then you will achieve liberation, you will achieve freedom, you understand how you're being manipulated by others and therefore you'll be free, you'll be empowered to live the way you want to live to see the world that is true to you. So let me give you three covered examples of how power works. Okay the first example is money. Let us do a thought experiment. I'm a bank okay I decide I want to open a bank and now you're allowed to put money in the bank okay so all of you get together and you put five $5 million in the bank, not $5 million. Now, why do you put $5 million into my bank? Because I promise you 1% interest, right? 1% interest. That's a really good deal. But now, because I owe you some money, right? I owe you 1% interest, I now need to go make money for myself. So I have a friend who's building a restaurant. And he says, I need $5 million to build a restaurant. And after a year, I will pay back 10% interest. Okay? 10% interest. And so I make a 9% profit, and I can use that to pay my employees, to pay myself a salary, to build a new building. Okay? So now I want you to think about this. On the bank, I got $5 million in deposit money, then I give out a five minute loan. Today, how much money is in the bank? How much money now do I have? I got five million dollars from you guys, then I gave it out to someone else. So how much money is in the bank right now? Zero, right? It should be zero. Logically, the answer is zero. In fact, zero is the answer that you are taught in economics. It's what you are taught, yeah? Zero is not an answer to the taught. Okay. You cannot loan all the money that you have. For example, they will have a limit like 25%, I don't know, maybe 10% so you can only loan like 4 million dollars. Okay, okay, yeah, okay, really good point. Okay, yes, okay, so that's really good. So in economics, you learn about the idea of the fractional reserve system. What's fractional reserve? As you say, you must leave behind a certain amount of money. It can be 7%, it can be 10%. Depends on the country. Let's say 10%. So theoretically, I cannot actually lend out $5 million. I'm going to lend out $4.5 million. You're right. That's law as well. Actually, okay, let's say I learned a $4.5 million, okay? Now how much money do I have in the bank? Yeah, half a million, right? So again, this is what you're taught in economics. This is what makes logical sense, right? The correct answer, what actually happens in real life, is you now have $9.5 million. That is the correct answer. This makes no sense, right? But it happens in reality. And how do we know? Because over the past 20 years, Chinese banks, like the Bank of China, the Bank of Industry and Commerce, the Agricultural Bank of China, if you Google these banks, what you will see is these past 20 years, these banks have become the largest in the world. How did that happen? Was it because Chinese people got rich and put all the money in the bank? No, that's not what happened. What happened, guys? What happened was these banks start to lend money out to corporations, to government, to people, to build skyscrapers, to build roads. In other words, the banks start to create money out of nothing in order to finance China's infrastructure projects. And that's what banks are allowed to do. They're allowed to print money, create money out of nothing. Does that make sense? Now the question then is, wait a minute here. That's kind of absurd. How this system come into being? How is it created? Okay, well actually there's a very easy explanation for where we got the system from. All right, so let me explain the history and the origin of the system. So in the beginning, it was merchants who engaged in finance. because merchants needed money in order to facilitate trade. And some merchants became extremely wealthy. And when they became very wealthy, they started banks in order to support trade and other merchants. Okay, so these banks traded in gold because that was the primary source and supply of money back there. So what happened is you would come and you would put your money, your gold in the bank for safe keeping. And the bank would give you a contract, right? A contract is just saying, thank you for giving me your gold. I promise to give back your gold at any time that you want it. And this is what we call a receipt, right? And this would allow for better an easier trade because now I can take this contract and I can go to England, okay? Maybe I'm based in Italy, but now I can go to England and say, listen, I need to buy cotton or bananas from you. And the person is like, well, what do you give me? I'm gonna give you gold, right? So I take the receipt and I give it to you, right? And why do we do this? Because it's a lot easier than giving gold to other people. And so this system would facilitate trade throughout the world. Doesn't make sense. Now, I'm the bank. I have all this gold. And I want to make money with it. So I want to give it to other people. So other merchants would come to me and say, listen, I need gold. Can you lend me out gold? But I say to him, yeah. But if I give you out the gold, you have a security issue. It's inconvenient for you. So why don't I give you a receipt, a contract instead? Does that make sense? Because all I need is a contract, all I need is a receipt in order to go and do trade elsewhere, right? So by doing this, what I've done is I've doubled the gold in my bank, right? I've created money out of nothing. So the gold is still five million. That hasn't changed, but the receipt is now five million plus five million. So theoretically, I now have 10 million in the bank. All right? So that's how money and finance works. Now there's a problem with the system. What's the problem with the system? What do you mean? Okay, that's a good question, okay? Why is it that people believe in me? Okay, the answer is very simple. The answer is because for most of the human history, People didn't need money. If you were just a normal person, what were you doing? Were you in a village growing crops? If you wanted to get new stuff, what would you do? You would trade with someone else, right? Maybe you have a goal that I want. Well, then I would trade you a cow for it. So we didn't actually need money. So for most of human history, no one had any need for money. It was only in certain circumstances that you would want money. So for example, marriage, right? So for most of human history, money represented debt that could be unpaid. So debt that could never be repaid. So for example, a very common thing is maybe you and I fight and I kill you. Well, in theory, your family should not come and kill me. But obviously, that would create a lot of problems, So the way to settle this dispute is I would give your family money because money was symbolically meant to say, I'm sorry, I killed you. This is a debt that can never be repaid. Okay. That's what money was used for in most of my senses throughout human history. There was no actually real use for money or symbolic, but with the rise of trade and with merchants, they needed money in order to facilitate the trade. But these merchants all knew each other. So they trusted each other anyway. So money was a mechanism for them to trade easier. Okay, does that make sense? All right, okay. So let's go back to the question. This system looks great. I can print money out of nothing, but there's a problem with this system. What is the problem? There's a problem here. Okay, that's actually a great question. Okay, so yeah, is it possible to forge the contract? Okay, so that's a really good point. The problem is, so the answer is that they all knew each other anyway. Okay, because it's a very small circle. Again, we have not reached the modern period where it's a lot of people using money. If that's the case, then fortune becomes a problem. We'll discuss this in future classes, okay? Counterfeiting. But at this point in history, Fortress is actually not a big issue. There's actually a bigger issue. And it's a huge issue. What's the issue? I have $5 million of gold, right? There's about $10 million of gold out there in receipts. What's the problem with that? The problem is that if everyone wants to go at the same time, I go bankrupt, right? Because I lose my reputation. The contract says that at any time you want the gold, I must give it to you. But if I have like, if there's $100 million in gold contracts, but I only have $10 million in gold, only if 15 million wants the gold back, then I'm screwed. If this is what we call a bank run, okay, a bank run. And this is a huge problem for merchants, okay? There's also another problem with the system. And the problem is this. Who do I usually lend my money to? Do you guys know? If I'm a bank, if I'm a merchant, who do I usually lend my money to? Okay guys, today we lend the money to entrepreneurs. But back then, they really weren't entrepreneurs. They were kings and noble people. And what did they do all the time? Why did they need money? To fight wars, okay? That's why there's a demand for gold. Because if I'm a king, I need to fight a war. Usually it gets my brother or someone else to control this territory, right? Now the problem with this is I could get killed, in which case, oops. But also, what's much more common is the king would be like, screw you, Bank. I don't need to pay you back, okay? So there's actually a lot of risks with this system. So for a time, develop a system to mitigate or reduce this risk, okay? What would they do? What they would do is they would create cartels. Cartels are just partnerships. So maybe this bank works with a little bank, works with a little bank throughout Europe. And the way they establish these cartels is usually through intermarriage, right? They would marry each other. They would combine together. And that way, let's say 15 million overseas wants back the goal, but there's only 10 million. Well, guess what? You just go to another bank, okay? And let's just say a king decides, I'm not gonna pay you back bank. Well, your bank works with other banks to establish a new enemy to kill the king to get the money back. Do you understand? And this system is what we call today central banking. And what you will learn in this class is, central banking controls the world today. Okay? Now what's really important about this system is that it's based on power. And what power is, you can turn nothing, money, the contract into everything. That's what money is. Okay, so we live in a world in which banks can print out money. So now, let's ask ourselves a question. Wait a minute here, if the banks can print as much money as possible, Why do we have poverty? Because we can just give money to poor people and they won't be pointing more. Why do we have poverty? If there's all the food in the world that we want, why are people starving still? Why? So we don't have limited resources, we have scarcity. Okay? So that is the common answer, scarcity. We have poverty because of scarcity. But I already told you this. They can put money out of nothing. So money is infinite. Money is an infinite resource. So why do we have poor people then? That's kind of strange. But if you just trade, they still have limited resources in the actual need. Like the actual needs. You see what's happening is this. You all believe money is scarce. Okay? I just spent the past 10, 20 minutes explaining to you, it's not scarce. It's infinite. Because it's just a number. we can at any time print out as much money as we need. Okay? So that's how power works. Power has brainwashed you into thinking something that is not true. You've been taught from the first day that money is scarce, but it's not scarce, it's infinite. And no matter what I say to you, you still believe this, okay? So you have to get that out of your head. Money is not scarce, it is infinite. So let's write the question. Why is there poverty in this world? Why do people starve? Why is there inequality in this world? Why are there poor people? Why are there rich people? What's the answer? Because they don't. Okay. Because it's scarce. So guys, this is amazing, okay? You guys can't get out of your head. You think money is scarce. You think it is not possible to print infinite money. Whenever I told you it is possible to print infinite money because they do this all the time. Yeah? I don't want to share the same. Yeah, because we don't want people to all have money. The powerful people don't want that. That's the exact answer. And why? Because otherwise no one would work. Do you understand? The point of putting money is not to give you money. The point of putting money is to create the illusion that money is valuable and therefore you work hard in order to obtain it. But in order for me to make you want to get money, I need to create artificial misery. Do you understand? Right? If there weren't poor people, you wouldn't want to be rich. It's only because you see people suffer that you would want to go make money for yourself. What do your parents tell you? Your parents tell you, work hard in school, make a lot of money. Otherwise, you're going to end up like a poor person. Right? Well, guess what? If you know poor people, your parents couldn't say that to you. And you wouldn't want to work hard in school. Right? That's why we have poverty. Because poverty creates the illusion that money is valuable. In other words, poverty isn't what you do to yourself, it is what the powerful do to you. Now let me ask you another question. You guys have studied some economics. What do you have like crises? Crises. For example, there's a stock market crash. Or for example, the economy goes down and people lose their jobs. Why do you have crises? Exactly, you're not taught this in economics class. That's kinda weird, right? The point of crises is destroy money. Why do we need to destroy money? Because if there's too much money in the system, people don't have to work. So you have to destroy this money in order to make people feel money is scarce. Okay, does that make sense? So why do we have wars? Why are there wars in the world then? Because they're fighting over scarce resources, right? I already told you, scarcity is a lie. The real reason is war is meant to destroy wealth in order to make you think money is valuable. You understand? You guys play War of Warcraft or these games, right? Guess what guys? What a Warcraft in our world? There's absolutely no difference. You just run around pointlessly working hard to obtain credits in order to buy stuff. If the credits just flew out of the sky because they could do that, right? They could actually program the engine to just put money out of nothing. You wouldn't do nothing every day. You wouldn't play the game, okay? It's only because you believe that there's scarcity in the world and that you must work hard to obtain wealth that you do any work. Do you understand this? Okay, so this world that we live in, it's a complete illusion created by central banking in order to make us work as hard as possible. Because the real value is that money. The real value is the work we do. Okay, does that make sense guys? All right, yeah? I wanted to ask, you said scarcity is an illusion, right? But I understand that money can be printed infinitely, but resources such as food and land, they aren't technically unlimited. So scarcity, the scarcity still exists in other resources. Okay, that's a great question. Okay, so the question is, isn't food scarce? Because food is a finite resource, right? Do yourself a favor, okay? Go to the garbage dump somewhere, anywhere in Beijing, and see the amount of food that is wasted every single day. If food was scarce, why do we have food waste? So if you just do the mathematics, what you will discover is there's not food to feed everyone. There doesn't have to be hunger and starvation. It's an artificial crisis. Does that make sense? So you're right in that, yeah, the food's at infinite, But it's abundant. There's a lot of it. Enough to feed people. Okay? It's the reason they got to move. Okay, all right. So again, you guys are stuck in the scarcity mindset. And it's very convincing. So let's move on, okay? So this is something that we'll go back to later on. Okay, because I cannot convince you today, this morning, that everything you believed about the world about yourself is wrong. Okay, you're still stuck there, like, okay, they're scarcity, and you're right, they're scarcity, but we also live in a world of abundance. Okay, and a lot of things that you believe are just misconceptions about the world. Okay, so we'll go back there, okay, later on. So let's move on, okay, so we've done money now, right? Now let's do another question. Let's do a question of happiness. The question for us today is, what makes us happy? Come on, what makes you happy? How can you live a happy life? Well, obviously money, right? If you have a lot of money, that's gonna make you happy. What else? Exactly, power, right? Sure, power, excuse me? Okay, good, freedom. Yeah, what else? Relationships, yep, sure. You have good friends, right? Like lots and lots of friends. What else? Okay, love, right? Love, sure. What else? Like video games, I guess. Vacations, okay? Lots and lots of things, okay? What you will discover about this list is this. You are thinking about individual happiness. This is actually unique in human history. If you were to go back in time five, five, five years ago, And you ask people, how can you be happy? They would focus more on collective happiness. In other words, if your community were not happy, you cannot be happy. So the very idea of the individual is new in human history. Before we understood that if you want to live a happy life, you need to take care of your family. You need to take care of your community. For them, for us, for most of human history, happiness meant helping others, being generous to others. So for example, let's just say that I go off and I wonder and then I find a lot of gold, right? I come back and what's the first thing I do with all this gold? Do you guys know? And this is like the ancient past. Take a whole item inside. Okay, yeah, good, right? We're gonna dig a hole and put that money inside because we wanna give to our children. That's a modern mindset. But what did they do before? And this happened throughout every society. If I became rich one day, what's the first thing I would do? Hmm? Sure. No, okay. So we'll learn this, okay? But the first thing that people did was they had a big feast for everyone. They spent all the money on a big feast. Because what mattered was your reputation within the community. What mattered was your generosity. If you got rich one day, you made sure that everyone in the community benefited from your wealth, usually by holding a big feast. And guess what, guys? This is true in China for most of Chinese history. If you come from a Chinese village, come to Beijing, you open a restaurant, you make a lot of money, you go out to your village. What's the first thing you do? Come on guys. You have a big feast for everyone. Okay, so this is ingrained in us, okay? But as you say, today what we believe is, if you have a lot of money, put it underground or put it in the bank, okay? But back then for most of human history, we would just spend it all on a big feast. We want everyone to share in happiness and that's what made us happy. Okay? Any questions? Yeah? I was wondering, you mentioned that it was full reputation on some levels that count into your individual practice, because after you get rich, you care about your career. Yeah, so you're asking, isn't this about individual reputation? And again, I mean, this is hard, okay? But the individual, the concept of individual did not exist before. We just created it. The idea that I'm a person independent of my family, independent of my community, independent of the world around me makes no sense. What was the worst punishment that could be inflicted on you in the past? Let's just say that we're going to fight I kill you, right? They said you're no longer a belong to this tribe. Exactly. Banishment, exile. Not death, right? And today, if I killed you, the police would come catch me and then kill me. before we didn't do that because the worst thing that we could do was exalute. It says you're no longer part of us. You understand? So the concept of the individual did not exist. Right? Okay. So let's move on. All right. So now I'm going to present two understandings of the world. And you're going to tell me which understanding you think is correct. The first understanding we humans don't have agency. We don't have really control. Why? Because there are powerful gods out there. OK? There are these powerful gods like Apollo, Dionyses. Oh, the problem, though, is that they are also controlled by other gods that are more powerful, like, for example, fate, fortune. And then there are these really ancient gods that control the structure of the universe. For example, maybe anger and pride. So you absolutely know individual agency because there's always a God screwing with you, okay? You might get rich, but then the God of pride looks at you and says, no, no, no, I need to teach this more to a lesson. So the God comes into me, makes me too arrogant and I screw up, okay? So we're always being controlled by these forces beyond our understanding. So that's a first worldview. Second worldview is this. We are synapses that generate memories. We are memories. Our understanding of the world comes from our experience that is controlled by synapses. Synapses come from a combination of DNA and environment. Our genes and our interaction with the environment, our experiences. And what this means is that we can now have control over an individual fate. If you're angry, it's because some experience or some genes made you angry and this anger becomes reinforced in your memories. And therefore, if you do proper therapy, if you do proper reflection, if you do some exercises, you can better control your anger and therefore control your fate. Okay? So in the first worldview, there are lots and lots of gods, they're evil and they're random and we have actually no control over our fate. We only hope to get lucky in life and not piss off the gods. In the second worldview, we are only a collection of our memories and we are only synapses. So we're able to manipulate the memories and the synapses in a proper way. We can be free of all problems. We can be free of anger. We can be free of hap- of- of depression. We can be free of misery. All right? Let me ask you this question. Which worldview is a more accurate reflection of reality? Obviously the second one, right? Because this is neuroscience. Science or psychology or psychiatry. This is what you've been taught in school. This is what you all believe. Our entire society structure around this very idea. And what you will learn in this class is it is completely wrong. This is a fact, it is the first one that is more accurate reflection of reality. The first one gives you more information, gives you a more accurate assessment of how the world really works. Okay? So now let me ask you this question. If the first worldview, and this is what we call polytheism, and polytheism for most of human history was the dominant religion, okay? Now we live in a world where the religion is science. Science is basically religion. So why did we make this transition? What's the benefit? If you're a powerful person, why would you prefer the second one as opposed to the first one? Why? What's the benefits to powerful people? What does power want to believe the second one, but not the first one? Yeah, okay. So the idea of individual responsibility, okay? So then there's more control, okay? It's easier to control people in the system, right? That's the first benefit. What's the second benefit? The second benefit is you will work harder, right? Because in the first system, you're like, you know what, I don't need to go make a lot of money because if I make a lot of money, the gods will punish me and make me proud. So I'm just gonna like enjoy life and take it easy. So in the first, in the second sense of no, no, I've control over my own life. So I need to work hard. Again, the entire point of the system is to make you work as hard as possible because when you work hard, that generates real wealth for the powerful people. Money does nothing. Money just incentivizes you to work hard. So this exists in order to make you work harder. There's one more benefit or there's more benefits, but what's another benefit? Okay, the other benefit is this, powerlessness, it makes you powerless. Why? This system is designed to make you absolutely powerless. Why? Why? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You see, see again, again, this is how you're brainwashed. You believe one makes you powerless, but that's not correct. Two makes you powerless, why? What's the difference between one and two? Why is it in number two, you're powerless? You're not the one who's powerless. Okay, so the problem with number two is you are incapable of collective action because you think all sorts of your problems is the individual in you and that society. But number one, you are capable of collective action. And the only way to change the world is through collective action. Does that make sense? This is a really important point. Two is a sign to make you think the source of all your problems is within you. So you should ignore what other people do and think. Doesn't matter to you. And therefore, you're incapable of identifying with other people. You're not capable of collective action. You're not capable of collective action, and you feel really miserable, what you will do is play video games or watch porn all day. Okay, and that's what's happening in society today. Yeah? Putting number two, like from experience, you should listen to the others if I take others perspectives and not just. So in number two, who has authority? Who do you listen to? You listen to scientists, right? Scientists. Because this system was created by scientists to trick you. Okay? This system you think, oh, it's science. Therefore it must be real. Guys, let me give you a piece of advice, okay? If you're ever feeling sad and you are depressed, what should you do? What should you do? What have you been taught to do? If you feel sad, you're depressed, what should you do? Hmm? Okay, yeah, the credit end is walk around. But that's not what you've been taught, right? What have you been taught to do? Okay, telling your friend to your parent, that's actually really good, right? So walking around, exercising, resting, talking to a friend about your problem, that's all really good. But what have you been taught to do in school? Really. If you are feeling really, really sad, what should you do? You should go talk to a psychiatrist, right? You should talk to a psychologist. And what will he or she do? Okay, well, I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, okay? And you can test it out for yourself. But if you're feeling sad and you are feeling depressed and you feel you have to talk to a psychiatrist and you do so, I will make you bet that the psychiatrist will make it a lot worse. You will feel worse after talking to a psychiatrist. Okay? And the reason why is the system is not designed to cure you of any problems. The system is to make you dependent on authority. You know that if you feel sad, well you don't want, just go for a walk, talk to a friend, you'll feel better over time. But the system teaches you, no, if you feel sad, go talk to a psychiatrist who'll give you drugs. It's designed to make you dependent on authority, yeah? I won't tell us like in scenario one, in real number one, wouldn't God also be an authority? God will also be an authority. That's actually a great question, okay? God is authority. Okay, that's actually a great question. Thank you so much. So I have to spend time to explain to you both systems and I will do so, but what's really important about number one is the gods are really bad people. The gods in number one, the polyphonic system, they fight all the time. They're vengeful, they're angry, they're proud, But because you're God, they can get away with it. And that's the difference between humans and gods. We're all the same. We're all angry. We're all jealous. We all fight, okay? But the gods can get away with it. Humans cannot. Gods can do hubris. We cannot do hubris. You understand? So the idea that, oh, the people in power are benevolent. the people in power or authority figures who are after our best interests. That is a new modern concept. Before it was assumed that the king is a king. Why? Because he's favored by the gods. It's not because he's a good person. It's not because he's a just ruler. It's just because the gods like him for whatever reason. But guess what? The gods give and the gods take. Maybe today the king will rule us, but maybe five years from now he gets unlucky and they got to kill him. Too bad. If you re-click mythology, and we'll do so in this class, okay? We'll go over into Greek civilization. We'll look at Ithapus. We'll look at Homer, the Iliad, okay? They talk about this all the time. Fate is something that you cannot control. It's something that happens to you. And therefore, you must live life to your best. All right? So the difference is this. The difference is in number one, They have a concept called eudaimonia. If you have no control over your fate, if things can happen to you tomorrow, like kill you, then live your life to the best of your ability today. Seize the day. Be the best that you can be today. And that's how you win favor from the gods. Eudaimonia, what we call flourishing. The point of life is to live it to the best of your ability. And that's why, guess what guys, the ancients, the Greeks, they were superior to us. If you read Greek literature, if you read Greek philosophy, Plato, Homer, Achei-Ishilis, Uribeides, they were the best. Today we suck. Why? Because instead of eudaimonia, we have pleasure. Rather than flourish as creative people We're like, how do I enjoy my life today? How do I not feel sad? Okay? So in the first system, even though it sounds like we have no control, we have no agency, but it inspires us to live to the best of our ability. In the second system, we're like, oh, you have complete control of your life. It enslaves us. All right, now let's move on to the third and final example. And I know this is shocking, I know this is surprising, But over the course of the semester, I will give you enough evidence to convince you that this is all true, okay? I'm just setting up the structure in the framework today. All right, let's do now the school. Guys, why do you have school? Why are we in school? Why? Why are you here? What? Some place, learn and teach. Exactly right, learn. What else? Yeah, to get the degree, okay? You get the degree, you're ready to graduate. What else? Knowledge, yes. You chance to brainwash the students? Excuse me? I feel like giving the power of chance to brainwash them. Brainwashing. Okay, guess what guys? The correct answer is brainwashing. Everything else is a lie. All right, what do you do in school? You come to class, you listen to a lecture, you read books, right? And then you have to do a test, and you have to write a paper. And then the teacher gives you a grade. That's how you learn, right? Let me ask you this question then. Throughout most of human history, how did we learn? If you want to become a doctor, what did you do? The answer is experience, do it, right? Let me ask you this question. Let's say you're 12 years old. You want me a doctor, okay? There are two paths ahead of you. The first path is, you know what? I'm just putting you in a hospital, and you're going to learn there for like 10 years. Someone's going to mentor you. Someone's going to be that person's apprentice. Maybe in the first year, all you do is like, wash the floor. But you're going to observe the doctor. And then eventually, the doctor is going to tell you how to treat patients. That's the first system. Second system is, you go to the best school in the world. Then you go to Harvard for undergraduate. Then you go to Harvard Medical School, the best medical school in the world. Okay, age 30, who's about a doctor, number one and number two? Obviously the first one, right? Because the second person, the person who went to Harvard and Harvard Medical School did not ever work in a hospital, you understand? Now let me ask you another question. In the first system, do you have to be really, really smart to be a good doctor? You don't actually. Anyone can be a doctor in the first system. Anyone. We human beings are all born with capacity to learn anything. If you wanted to learn it, right? You'll be an engineer. You'll be a lawyer. If you want to be a doctor, if you'll be a scientist, you'll be anything, OK? Just go find a mentor who can teach you how to do so. And I guarantee you that you will learn how to do it. well and anyone can do this but instead we have a system in which we tell students you're smart you're stupid smart students go to good schools and good universities and they get good jobs stupid students go wash dishes okay and that was not true for most of human history it's true today but for most of you of human history you have to go learn something all you had to do was Go find a teacher and that teacher will teach you and then you would learn it right, so school is not a place to Teach you how to learn a school doesn't teach you knowledge. It doesn't do that a School is a place that brainwashes you Okay, now the question is What is the brainwash you in? What would it brainwash you? Okay. All right to answer that I'm going to give you some history, okay? We will do a lot of history in this class. But I'm going to tell you the three societies that first introduce mandatory free public schooling in the world, okay? The first is called SPARTA, okay? SPARTA was a small city-state in Greece like 3, 4,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago. And they had a new system in which children as early as five or six years old, they were put into a school. And in the school, they were being up by older kids who were like nine or 10. Okay. That's Sparta. The second society was called the axe text, axe text. And they also provided free compulsory education to all its children. Really good, right? And the third society is called pressure. And actually pressure is a system that everyone uses today. Do you guys know any history? What is common about all three societies? Sparta, Aztecs, and Prussia. What is common to all three? War. All three societies are fundamentally war societies dedicated to defeating their neighbors. Sparta was one of thousands of city-states in Greece. The only society of these thousands that had compulsory education. Why? Because Sparta was first and foremost engaged in war-making. Sparta, you've heard of Spartans, right? It's the Spartan warrior, okay? The Aztecs were the greatest war society in Central America before the arrival of the Europeans. They defeated everyone. They were engaged in war. They also did a lot of human sacrifices, well. Okay, we learn about the Aztecs later on. Prussia, the Prussians, the greatest military in Europe for centuries. They were engaged in war making as well. Okay, do you understand this? Why we have schools is because schools are really good at preparing people for war. Why? Excuse me? They have people under, they have, they teach some kids how to do it so well. What is, what is, why, let me ask you this question. Why did they not have schools before? Why isn't that people were like, we don't want schools, why? Again, the Sparta Aspects and Pressure with a few societies that had free public schooling. Why didn't other societies just copy them? Why? Let me ask you this question. Let's just say you're a mother or a father. What's the, and you have a child, right? What's the worst thing that could happen in your life? Hmm? No, no, your mother or your father, you have a child, right? What's the worst thing that can happen to you in your life? Your child is taking away from you, right? What does school do? School is designed to take your child away from you. Okay. Let me ask you this question. If school is about learning, why don't parents and children go to school together? Yeah, why not? Why? Because parents have to work to survive, right? There's actually a better reason why. Yeah, it's about brainwashing, right? Because how do you brainwash someone? Right? If you're with your parent, are you brainwashed? No. Because you feel love, you feel secure, your parents are going to protect you. You're not your parent. Hey, is this teacher, is he or she lying to me? And the parent's like, yeah, he's lying to you, okay? It's only because you've been taken away from your parent that you are now willing to be brainwashed. Why? Because what happens if you leave your parents? How do you feel? How do you feel? Hmm? Yeah, exactly, right? Insecure, you're anxious, you're afraid. Do you understand? You've lost your parent. You're four, you're five, you're six years old. you've lost your parent. You feel really insecure. So who do you trust? Your teacher. What if your teacher says is now correct? They went to school before our parents. Yeah, okay. That's a great point, okay? What about our parents' brainwash as well? That's correct. Your parents are brainwash. But what I'm saying is when a parent is with a child, the child feels secure. And if you're secure, You're much more willing to disobey authority. You're much willing to ask questions. You're much willing to think for yourself because you feel secure, because your parent is there to protect you. But if you take the parent away, you can't do that. You must be now rely on the teacher who can now brainwash you, okay? So are you brainwashing us? Am I brainwashing you? Okay. I think it's a jar too. Okay, all right, okay. So the question is, am I brainwashing you? Okay, that's a good question. And it's a fair question. And again, that's why I tell you this. You have the capacity to ask me questions. You have the capacity to challenge me. You have the capacity to think for yourself. So all I'm saying is, hear me out, ask me questions, and then think for yourself whether or not I make sense. Because the difference between my class and other classes is like, I don't test you. I don't give you grades. It's a pass-fail class. You can actually choose to say, you know what, this is nonsense, I don't wanna listen anymore. I can't stop you, okay? But in school, guess what happens if you don't go come to school? Your parents get arrested, all right? Do you understand, that's the difference. It's your choice whether to pay attention or not. So another question is, okay, if schools are designed to brainwash you, what are they brainwashing you in? Well, they designed a brainwasher to believe a concept called the nation state, the nation state. The scores are designed to brainwash you to think the nation state exists. It is a person, mother China. You must love this person. You must be willing to sacrifice yourself for this person. You must be willing to dedicate yourself to this person because it is mother China. And how do we brainwash you? We teach you language, right? We teach you history. We teach you geography. We teach you all this to make you believe that the nation state, mother China, the United States, France, they all exist. But guess what? Throughout most of human history, it was absurd to think the nation state existed. Okay? Before you didn't say I'm Chinese. Before you say I'm a Beijinger or I'm from Haidian or I'm from Chaoyang, right? because that makes more sense. You're from a place where you know the people. But now, because of the nation state, you are forced to believe that you are the same person as someone from Yunnan, Tibet, Guangxi, even though that's what I guess, you have absolutely nothing in common. But you're all Chinese. And that's what school is designed to do. School is designed to implant in you a false memory of a nation state. That's what history is. History is the false memory of a nation state. And it happened, and that's why you're all forced to go to school, okay? We also want you to think about degrees and work as an all-person, not to create people business with rice and all. Yeah, so yeah, so the point of school is to serve the nation state, do you understand? Right? Does that make sense? If you believe in the nation state, if you believe in mother China, then you must serve her, you must obey her, you must fight for her, you must die for her. Okay? So the idea of the nation state was created in order to make you obedient to authority. And it works very effectively. Yeah? I'm just wondering if this works out of hand. All countries, all countries are nation states. Okay? So I mean, I'm not saying China is different from other places. China is exactly the same as other places. What you will learn in this class is, how do we get to this place? Because again, the three things that we learn, money, the individual, the nation state, these are all ideas and concepts beyond the human experience. If you try to work this out from first principles, you try to figure this out by yourself, you couldn't do it. You have to be brainwashed into believing these three things. If someone from the past, maybe a thousand years ago, were to come today and you would explain the concept of money, individual, and nation state. The person would be like, wait a minute here. This means that you're all slaves. Okay? So now the question then is, where do we get these three concepts from? What you will learn in this class is, these three concepts come from a revolution in human thought called monotheism. The one true God. This idea of monotheism forever changed the course of human history. They gave us these concepts of money, individual and nation state. Monotheism is such a powerful idea that it turned nothing into everything. Okay, that's what you will learn in this class. We will learn about monotheism, we will discover how it created money, individual, and the nation state, and it basically created the world that we live in today. Okay, all right, any questions? Should we? Okay, yeah, so there are three great monotheistic religions, right? Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. What I will show you later on is, it's basically the same religion. Okay, so I don't wanna give you too much information, okay, because it was a lot to process, But I want you guys to remember the concepts. Money, individual, and nation state are all powerful concepts that are embedded into everyday life. You cannot escape it. You've been brainwashed and thinking that they all exist when in fact they actually don't exist. And that's how power works. What power is, okay, what power truly is, is what we call alchemy. Alchemy throughout human history was the pursuit of turning lead into gold. Okay, lead into gold. Okay, nothing into everything. That's what alchemy was. And maybe in science class, you're taught that alchemy is this fake science. It's a pseudo science and it did not work. What you will learn in this class is we achieve alchemy. Okay, we turn nothing into everything. which are led into gold, or that's what power is. Power is a capacity to turn nothing into everything. Power is a capacity to make you believe that money is valuable, that the individual can lead to happiness, that the nation state exists. That's what power is, okay? And as a result, today we live extremely miserable lives. Okay? So you've been taught to think that, Oh, life just gets better and better. What you will learn in this class is actually, nope. And what's really important is you will also learn in this class that this was an accident. This was just an accident. It's an accident of the human imagination. It's because we didn't know what we were doing that we created this system. So what you also learn is that you're able to control the human imagination. You can use it to create a new system that allows for eudaimonia or the flourishing of the human intellect. Okay? All right, any questions? Okay, so that's it for today. Okay, I'll see you guys next class."}

So we finished Dante today and this will be our last session before the semester breaks. We'll come back in a month and we'll start the second semester. Second semester will be very exciting. We're going to do the Crusades, we're going to do secret societies, we'll do basically the rest of human history. Okay, so before we begin, Then let's review what we learned last class. The first point is that there are secrets, mysteries, and paradoxes embedded into Dante's divine comedy. And the ultimate secret of the universe is that we are in God and God is in us. And that's the ultimate secret. And it breaks apart the idea of the Holy Trinity. Remember the idea of the Holy Trinity is that it's an equation that makes God exclusive from us. And at the end of the vine comedy, Dante inserts us back into God, which turns the equation back into a story, a story that we are empowered to write. And it creates the idea of infinity. The idea behind this, and this goes back to Homer, is for Dante, love is the unifying force of the universe. Remember that God is the force within us that enables us to love and connect with others. And then the imagination is the animating force of the universe. The more we love, the more we can imagine. And it is our responsibility. It is our legacy. It is our gift that we are able to imagine the universe and continue the work of God. And the prime example of this is of course Dante. What inspires Dante to create the universe that is the divine comedy is his love for Beatrice. It is unrecreated. They never got married. They never consummate their love. In fact, Beatrice died when she was very young, but Dante never forgot about her. And it was this love for Dante, sorry, it was this love for Beatrice that would inspire him to create the Divine Comedy, which is the greatest literary achievement in human history. And as we discussed, the second point is that the divine comedy it is historically significant because it becomes an actual blueprint for the Renaissance for the process of information and the silent revolution and then you ask yourself Wait a minute here when I read the divine comedy. I don't we understand what's going on So how did it come to be so historically significant and the answer is this? The answer is that it is poetry. And poetry is a unique form of writing. Poetry is meant to be memorized. Okay? So the way you learn, the way you're educated for thousands of years in Western history is through the memorization of classical poets. So remember the Greeks, how did they educate themselves, they memorize Homer. The Romans memorize Virgil. And the Italians memorize Dante. And poetry is uniquely designed in order to be memorized. And so that's the first step. And then the second step is this. Think of poetry as a superfood for the brain. You are what you eat. And your brain thinks the way that it has consumed information. And so poetry is this extremely dense, nutritious food that the brain will use in order to formulate its understanding of the world. And what's really interesting is the brain actually works 99% subconsciously, meaning we are not consciously aware of what the brain is doing most of the time. And what the brain is doing most of the time is trying to figure out the patterns of the universe. The brain does not like paradoxes. It does not like mysteries. It does not like contradictions. So it's always trying to resolve these contradictions in order to formulate a coherent understanding of the world. That's why paradox is so powerful within the divine comedy. As we discussed last class, the divine comedy is full of paradoxes which force your brain to constantly work to resolve these paradoxes. The greatest paradox within the Divine Comedy, as we discussed in the last class, is the fact that we are within God. And that creates a paradox for the brain to slowly resolve. And once it resolves, it formulates a new understanding of the world. And because of that, this new understanding will become the Renaissance brain, the scientific brain, which will power the rise of modernity. Does that make sense? So the third point, the most important point is what Dante realized when he wrote the Divine Comedy is that if he is to create a new modern brain, if he is to create a new scientific romantic mind, then his true enemy is actually not Augustine. It is actually Virgil because at this time every educated individual was educated through Virgil. It was Virgil's understanding the world that captured the imagination of the European mind. And so Dante when he writes the Divine Comedy, his mission is is just a plant Virgil. It is to remove Virgil from the brain, the mind of the European. He basically needs to, he basically needs to poetically do surgery. Okay? And the way, and so what I'll do is this. First I'll explain the thesis and explain what he's trying to do. And then we'll study the divine comedy to see how he does that. Okay? So Dante understands that if Virgil has become the basis of your mind, okay, if the Iniad is the way that people fundamentally understand the world, you cannot get go into an open conflict with Virgil because people will just reject you, right? People will choose their customs, their habits first. And so if you threaten their habits and customs, then it will see you as a threat. They will reject you. So Dante has to perform surgery on the brain that is nuanced and subtle and sophisticated. Okay? The way he does this, the way he does that, it's very clever. Dante makes his arch nemesis virtual, the hero of the Divine comedy. Okay? Virgil is the guide, the narrator, the protagonist of the divine comedy. What happens is that we start off with Dante, the poet, lost in the woods and it's a symbol or metaphor for his midlife crisis. He doesn't know where he's going, he's confused by the world and certainly Virgil appears before him and says, I am Virgil a poet and I've been sent by the Lady of in heaven to guide you through infernal and for purgatory where you will learn the secrets of the universe, where you will learn the truth about the world, and I am your guide. I will tell you the truth. Okay? So right from the start, we learned that Virgil is the hero, the guide. That's the first thing that happens. happens. And the second thing that happens is, Dante turns him into an unreliable guide. We will discover that Virgil does not speak the truth. In fact, Virgil contradicts himself all the time. And the third thing that will happen is Virgil over time will become displaced by other figures, including Beatrice. All right, so it is one of the greatest literary tricks where Dante understands Virgil, his ultimate nemesis, and in order to defeat Virgil, he makes Virgil the hero of this epic. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so it's the idea of the unreliable narrator. All right, so we're gonna study some passengers from the vine comedy to see how Dante does this. And it's very clever. It's almost impossible to spot unless you recognize what Dante is trying to do. Once I tell you what he's doing, it's not as obvious. But again, if you were to read the vine comedy by yourself, you wouldn't notice it. But again, the brain works subconsciously. And the brain will slowly over time pick up these problems with Virgil and construct a new worldview that is anti-Virgil and pro-Dante. That's a trick of the Divine Comedy. Any questions before I continue? Are we clear? So Virgil and Dante are now going to explore the infernal hell. they first end up in limbo. And limbo is the outer circle of hell. And it's a very nice place. It's that paradise. It's that great. It's still part of hell. But it's a place specifically for virtuous pagans who were born before the time of Jesus. You can only be saved by Jesus if you are baptized into the faith. And so if unfortunately you were born before the time of Jesus, you are put in limbo. And that's where Virgil is. Okay? So Virgil explains to Dante, the kindly master. Okay? So there are all these encomiums for Virgil. Virgil is the father to Dante. Virgil is the master to Dante. All right? Do you not ask who are the spirits whom you see before you? I have you know before you go ahead. They're not sin. Okay. These people are virtuous including himself. These are people who include Plato Homer Julius Caesar, okay, these individuals are Virtuous though they have merits. That's not enough because they lack baptism Okay, the fundamental rule of heaven is you have to baptize into the faith The portal of the faith that you embrace and if they live before Christianity they did not worship God in fitting ways and of such spirits I myself am one. Okay, this is why I'm here in limbo. I am as virtuous as can be but because I was not baptized in the faith I am stuck here. Okay, of course this raises a question because Dante has nothing but questions and then I asked him this question is this an iron law of the universe or were there exceptions? Okay so we asked did any ever go by his own merit or others from this place towards blessedness? Were they able to ascend into heaven based on his or her own individual struggle and merit? And this is what Virgil says. There was only one time in the entire history of the universe when it was possible for people in limbo to ascend into heaven and that was the death of Jesus Christ. Remember that he was crucified and he died before he was resurrected and then when we died he ascended into the inferno and while he was there he took the most virtuous members of the Bible, okay, who include Abel, Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel. He took all of them into heaven. But that was it, okay, and that was a rare event, right? Because Jesus, God, only dies once. But that's it, all right? And so that's That's what Virgil is saying. Okay, so now that they've been through limbo, what they're going to do is they're going into the inner circles of hell. And the first circle of hell are reserved for those who died, who sinned because of love, because of lust. Okay? And what's going to happen is that there's going to be parade of all these souls, these spirits who are burning in hell because they died for love or lust, they sinned out of love. All right, so the first of those about whose history you want to know, my master told me, once ruled as empress over many nations. Her vice of lust became so customary that she made license, licent in her laws, to free her from a scandal she had caused. She is Samaramis, of whom we read that she was needed as wife and a successor. Okay, that's the first person they see. She held the land, the Sultan now commands. All right? But now, there's a second person. The other spirit killed herself for love and she betrayed the ashes of Psycheis. The Watan Cleopatra follows next. All right? So this is interesting. What's going to happen is there will be about a thousand spirits who are parading before Dante and Virgil. And what's interesting is that Virgil names every one of them except this person. The other spirit killed herself for love and she betrayed the ashes of psychiatrists. This person, her name is Diddo. Who is Diddo? Diddo is from the Iniad, right? She is the liter creation of Virgil. This is really interesting because why is Ditto in the Inferno? Because Virgil put her there and not only does he put her there, he does not even bother to acknowledge and name her. This is a complete contrast to the relationship between Dante and in Beatrice. Now, when you actually read the Inaad, what you discover is that there's only one realistic character in the epic and it's Diddle. The way that she behaves, her love for Inaads, it's actually, it makes her a sympathetic character. But it's a love for any is that causes her to die. And so who is Diddo? Who is Diddo really? Well if she's a litter creation of Virgil's, I can guess, we can surmise that Diddo must have existed and Diddo is someone who possibly could have Expited a Virgil right and that's why Virgil has such venom for her right remember in the in the ad little dies by Fling herself into a funeral pyre. Okay. She burns herself to to death. It's a terrible way to die and she dies Given into madness by love so you can almost with the argument that you can surmise Virgil really hates this person and he wanted to punish her for refusing him in real life. And this is interesting for us because this is dimatically opposed to what Dante did, right? Dante loved Beatrice but he could not possess Beatrice. So what he does is he creates the divine harmony so that Beatrice can be in paradise for the rest of her for all eternity. Okay this is that I'm actually opposed. So right away in the from this we can understand that Dante and Virgil have opposing perspectives on love. These are not friends these are enemies. All right now let's continue. Virgil refuses to name Diddle. Okay? But what Dante will do is name Diddle. Okay? Those spirits left the ranks where Diddle suffers, where Diddle suffers. Virgil, you refuse to acknowledge your creation, but I will, because she deserves our mercy. She deserves our charity and our generosity. So you can see how within In the poetry, there's this massive conflict going on between Virgil and Dante. It's all very subtle. Okay? Okay. Now, they go through inferno and they end up in Purgatory. Purgatory is this isolated mountain that is the halfway point between inferno and paradise. people have to send the purgatory in order to get into paradise. These are the first lines of purgatory. I saw a solitary patriarch near me, his aspect worthy of such reverence that even son to father owes no more. This person is Cato. Cato is a Roman patriarch who opposed Julius Caesar. When Julius Caesar was about to win the Civil War, Cato killed himself. He committed suicide rather than submit to Julius Caesar. Now what's interesting about this is that Cato and Virgil are contemporaries. They knew each other in Rome. And when they died, they went to Limbo. What's interesting is this. Where's Cato now? Cato is in Purgatory. He's left limbo. He's left inferno. And not only that, but he's become the guardian of purgatory. He's the one who controls access into purgatory. So Virgil is wrong. Remember, Virgil said it's impossible to leave limbo regardless of your merit. And this, right away, tells us, no, Virgil is not a reliable narrator. Cato has left. OK? Now you would imagine that because Kato and Virgil know each other, they're like good friends. So Virgil, so Kato says to Virgil and Donal, who are you to? How are you able to escape from hell? And then Virgil says, let me do the talking because I know this guy. We're friends. I do not come through my own self. There's a lady sent from heaven. Okay, this lady is Beatrice. Her please let me to help and guide this man. But since your will would have a far more full and accurate account of our condition, my will cannot withhold what you request. You wanna know why we're here? Let me explain to you why we're here. This man had yet to see his final evening. He's not dead, but for his folly, little time was left before he did. He was so close to it. He was facing a midlife crisis. As I've told you, I was sent to him for his deliverance. The only road I could have taken was the road I took. I had to take him through hell. And that's why we're here. I showed him all the people of perdition. Now I intend to show him to him those spirits who in your care, remember, Katie was the guardian of purgatory, are bent on expiation. So people are here in purgatory in order to absolve themselves of their sins so that they may ascend into heaven. Now, this is what Virgil says to Cato, you know it, who in Utica, found death for freedom, was not bitter, when you left the garb that will be bright on the great day. So I know who you are, you're Cato. You're the person who killed himself in Utica, rather submit to the tyranny of Julius Caesar. Eternal edicts are not broken for us. This man's alive and I'm not bound by my nose, but I am from the circle where the chase, eyes of your marcia, your wife are. I know your wife. And she still prays to you, O holy breast, to keep her as your own, for her love then inclined to us. Remember, Marcia, your wife, allow our journey through your seven realms. I shall thank her for kindness, you bestow, if you would let your name be named below. So what Virgil is doing in Saint Makeda, listen, you may be the guardian of purgatory, this is your master of this realm, but I have power in hell. So I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna be nice to your wife, Marcia, right? So give me some face here, man, you know? And this is what Cato says. While I was there, within the other world, Marcia so pleased my eyes, he then replied, each kindness required I satisfied. Now that she dwells beyond the evil river, she has no power to move me any longer. Such was the law decreed when I was freed. So Cato is upset with this. Cato says to Virgil, how dare you bribe me? How dare you do this? Marcia is back in limbo, which means she is no longer as pure in my eyes as I used to think. If I'm able to ascend into purgatory based on my own merit, then so was Marcia. And if she's not able to come with me, That means she's not as virtuous as I once thought. So you can see right away that Virgil is not reliable. He has no authority over Cato. Cato does not respect him, even though they know each other very well. Does that make sense? Again, this is very, very clever. It's almost impossible to see unless I tell you what's happening. All right. Now the question then is, what makes Virgil so unreliable? What is his problem? And what Dante will reveal to us is, it's really Virgil's conception of love. That's the issue. Remember, Virgil is someone who can damn Ditto into hell. And it is Dante who sent Beatrice into heaven. So these two individuals have radically opposing conceptions of love. So we know what Gandhi thinks about love. Love is the God force within us that connects us with God and the entire universe. And the more that we love, the more imaginative we will be. So you have to direct this love at someone, but it doesn't really matter that person loves you back. That's not relevant, okay? What's relevant is that you love. So let's look at Virgil's understanding of love. The soul which is quick to love so he spawns everything that pleases just as soon as beauty wakens it to act. Okay, so the first thing we have to understand is that we are animals with souls that respond to beauty. If I see a beautiful woman across the street, I stop and I chase her, okay? That's the first thing he says. Your apprehension draws an image from a real object and expands upon that object until soul has turned toward it. But then you're like, but you don't know this beautiful woman. And what Virgil says is, what happens next is your imagination will take over and you will turn this woman into a fantasy woman that you can now control. Okay, so let's go back to the example from last class where you meet this beautiful woman and you say, I want to marry you because you're so beautiful. And she says, I will if you give me $10 million. Now, if you think about it, she's clearly saying no to you. But it is your imagination that tricks you into believing that as long as you give her $10 million, she will love you. Her love is something that you can master and control and possess. And if soul turn, the soul tend to set fastedly, then that propensity is love. It's nature that joins a soul in you, a new through beauty. You must possess her. You will do everything possible in order to possess her. And that's what love is. You see someone beautiful. You turn her into a fantasy. And then you chase after this fantasy until it's yours. That's what love is. Then, just as flames ascend because the former fire was fashioned to fly upward toward the stuff to its own spear where it lasts longer. Okay, so you can understand that what Virgil uses is of natural imagery, okay? Fire. So these are things beyond our control, right? We are consumed by our lust and our love for this woman. So does the soul when sees move into longing, emotion of the spirit, never resting till the beloved thing has made a joyous. We have to possess it. we don't possess it, then we will be depressed. Now you can plainly see how deeply hidden truth is from screeners who would insist that every love is in itself praiseworthy. Okay? There's some people who believe that love is beautiful. No, no, no, it depends on who you love, okay? And they are led to error by the matter of love because it may seem always good, but not each seal is fine, although the wax is. Okay? If you love a woman who loves you back, that's fine. But if a woman insists that you go rob a bank for $10 million, then that's bad. All right? Your speech and my own wit that follow it, I answered him. This is Dante. Have shown me what love is. But that has filled me with greater doubt. If our love's offered to us from above, and it's the only foot with which soul walks, soul going straight or crooked has no merit. Okay? This is a really interesting question. If it is true that when we see someone beautiful, we must have her, then we have no free will. We have no free choice. We're just all animals. And this is what Virgil says. What reason can see here, I can impart, pass that for truth or faith, it's Beatrice alone you must await. Every substantial form at once distinct from matter and can join to it and gathers the force that is distinctly its own. A force unknown to us until it acts. It's ever shown except in its effects, just as green boughs display the life in plants. So it is true that our soul wants to possess things that are beautiful, okay? That's what love is. And thus man does not know the source of his intelligence or of primal motions and is turning towards desires, primal objects, okay? So we are not aware of the lust within us. We are not aware of how our soul works. Both are in you just as in bees, there is the honey making urge. Such primal will, there's no praise, it deserves no blame. We just lust for what is beautiful. That's just how we are made. Now that all other longings may conform to this first will, there is in you, inborn, the power that counts us, keep all the threshold of your ascent. This is the principle of which Your merit may be judged for it garners and win those good and evil longings. So what we can do, our choice, our free will in the matter is to resist our temptation, to say no. That's what Augustine would say, right? We just say no, no, no. Yes, I want her, but it's bad for me, so I will stop myself from doing so. Those reasons who reach the roots of things learn of this inborn freedom, the bequest that, thus, they left onto the world is ethics. Even if we allow necessity as source for every power that inflames in you, the power to curb that love is still your own. The power to curb that love is still your own. We can resist. We can say no. We can deny our love. This noble power is what Beatrice means by free will. Therefore, remember it if she should ever speak of it to you. So this is the conception of love from Virgil. Does that make sense? Love can be good or it can be bad. It's you who must decide. If it's bad for you, then you must resist. And so what is Dante's response to this argument? Do you guys remember? What's a response to this? The response is this. response is, if you truly love someone, then you only want what's best for that person. And so if the person says to you, I will only marry you if you give me $10 million, then you know that person doesn't love you. So you turn away from her and says, all I care about is your happiness. If you're happier without me, then I will leave. But I certainly will not degrade you by thinking that you're only worth $10 million. To my eyes, you're priceless. And you will need to grade yourself if you think that you're only worth $10 million. It doesn't make sense. So love is not about possession. It's about respecting the person for who she is. That doesn't make sense. All right, so let's continue. So now they're climbing up the mountain of Purgatory and Purgatory is an isolated mountain Okay, there's a force field around it that protects it from the natural elements But every now and then there's an earthquake. Okay, the entire mountain trembles and the reason why is because a soul within that mountain has cleanse himself or herself of her sins She's absorbed herself of her sins and therefore He or she now has access to heaven and the heavens celebrate this with with a shake, okay with an earthquake so Virgil and Dunder climbing and they meet a man named statius a poet who has just Expaired himself. Okay, who's just released himself from his sins and he's so excited because he's going to heaven Alright? And this is what he says, So have the will to climb before, but that will was opposed by allowing to do penance, as one should sin instilled by divine justice. So the people in Pugatory are those who have committed a sin and they need to do penance before they go to heaven. Now this is really important. Why? Because actually I'll ask you this question. If hell is a place where people go because they have sin and Purgatory is a place where people go because they sin. What is the difference? Right? Okay. And what we will learn is this. The difference is the question of will. People in Purgatory recognize that they have committed a sin and that they must do penance before they go to heaven. But they are willing to admit that they've committed a sin and they're willing to do penance and the penance could be a thousand years it could be one year it doesn't it doesn't matter okay but they wouldn't commit themselves to penance hell is a place where you go because you refuse to admit you've committed a sin you refuse to admit you're wrong if you refuse to meet your wrong you can never you can never do penance you can never absolve yourself of your sins that's That's the difference. Guys, that's the only difference. In terms of crime, in terms of sin, it's the same. But the difference is those in purgatory have committed themselves to redeeming themselves. So let's continue. And I, and this is Stadius, by the way, who have lain in the suffering 500 years. He's been here 500 years. And more, just now have felt my free will for a better threshold. Thus you have heard the earthquake and the pious spirits throughout the mountain as they praise the Lord and may he send them speedily upward. So if you are able to release yourself from your sin, you are now, there's an earthquake and you now have access to heaven. So did he speak to us and just as joy, it's greatest when we quench a greater thirst that joy he brought cannot be told in words. Status is the happiest person in the universe at this point because he has found paradise. And my wise guy, and this is Virgil, I now can see the net in petting you how one slips food and why it quakes here and what makes you all rejoice. And now I'm going to please you to tell me who you were and your own words may I find why you've laid here for so many centuries. Tell us who you are. Okay, who are you? How are you going to accomplish this? In that age when the world is tightest with help from the highest king, avenged the wounds from which the blood that Judas sold had flowed.\" Okay, so this is about 70. And this in tightest is the Roman general who attacked Jerusalem, sacked it, and destroyed the temple. And the Christians saw this as revenge for the killing of their savior, Jesus. At sufficient fame beyond that spirit replied, I bore the name that lasts the longest and onest most, but faith was not yet mine. Okay? So he's trying to explain who he is. So gentle was the spirit of my verse that Rome drew me, sort of tallest to her, and there were my brow deserved a crown of myrtle. On earth my name is still remembered, statius. I sang of thieves and then of great Achilles. I fell along the way of that lost labor, okay? So he's an epic poet, just like Virgil. That the sparks that warmed me, the seeds of my ardor were from the holy fire. The same that gave more than a thousand poets let in flame. So what inspired me is the Holy Fire. Who is the Holy Fire? We would think God, right? Nope, it is Virgil. I speak of the Inead. It is Virgil, who is the Holy Fire. It is Virgil who is God. When I wrote verse, it was mother to me, it was nurse. My work, rather, would not weigh an ounce. I was inspired by the Inead and Virgil to write my poetry. Virgil is the God, the mother who nursed me. And to have lived on earth when Virgil lived, for that I would extend by one more year the time I owe before my exiles end. I've been in Purgatory for 500 years. But if I had a chance to meet Virgil, I would stay one more year. That's how Virgil, that's how much I love Virgil. That's how important Virgil is to me. He doesn't know that the person standing next to him is Virgil. These words made Virgil turn to me and as he turned his face through silence said, be still. He's like, shut up man. I don't want to know who I am. So what's going on here? Well, what's really important for us to understand is that this shows us that Virgil was lying. Virgil told us in the beginning of the Divine Comedy, it was impossible for merit to leave limbo and ascend to paradise. He told us that you have to be baptized in order to get into heaven. Status was not baptized. Status is exactly like Virgil, a Roman epic poet. But status is able to ascend to heaven. But Virgil is not. Does that make sense? And the reason why Stadius is able to go to heaven is Stadius wants to, okay? He's willing to admit there are flaws in his thinking. He's willing to admit that his understanding of the world is flawed and he needs to undergo introspection, reflection to improve himself. Virgil is not. Does that make sense? All right? So let's go to the very last passage and then we'll end. And this is, this is candle 30. And this is when Beatrice is ascending from heaven. Okay, no, she's sorry. She's descending from heaven on a chariot. And it is, and she's beautiful, okay? And at this point, if you're a Virgil, you might be like, wow, this is my chance to get out of limbo and go to heaven, right? Because Beatrice, who's in heaven, ask me to do her a favor. Guide Dante through inferno and purgatory. I've done that, man. Now she owes me. Now here's my chance to say to Beatrice, hey, could you do me a favor and like get me into heaven? That's all he has to do, right? That would make sense. Let's see what happens. So this is Beatrice descending from heaven and Dante is enraptured, okay? He's just completely, she's completely focused on Beatrice. Within her presence, I had once been used to feeling trembling, wonder, that's the solution. But that was long ago. Still, though my soul, now she was veiled, could not see her directly by with hidden force that she could move. I felt the mighty power of old love. All right, so it's been decades since Hilaas saw her, but he still feels for her. He's trembling, okay, he's completely raptured by Beatrice. As soon as that deep force had struck my vision, the power that when I had not yet left my bot boyhood, had already transfixed me, I turned around and to my left, just as a little child afraid of in distress, will hurry to his mother anxiously, he's turning around. Who does he want to talk to? Virgil, right? He's, there are butterflies in his stomach. He's excited, he's trembling. He said, Virgil, Virgil, it's Beatrice, okay? He sees Virgil as his father. He wants to share his joy with Virgil. All right? And where is Virgil? To say to Virgil, I am left with less than one drop of my blood that does not tremble. I recognize the signs of the old flame. Virgil, it's Beatrice. I've waited decades for this moment. He wants to share this happiness with Virgil. But Virgil had to practice us of himself, Virgil, the generous father, Virgil, he to whom I give myself for my salvation, Virgil has run away at this climax, at this moment when Dante is finally reunited with Beatrice. The moment that Virgil has completed his quest, Virgil has run away. He's ran, he's run away, he's disappeared. No one knows where he is. And even our ancient mother-laws was not enough to keep my cheeks don't wash with dew from darkening again with tears. What Dante wants more than anything else is for Virgil to share his happiness. What he wants more than anything else is for Virgil to ascend to heaven, like Dante will. And Virgil's disappeared. And Dante knows at this point, Virgil will never change. Virgil's run away because he refuses to admit he is wrong. You understand? Once Virgil sees the love between Beatrice and Dante, then Virgil knows the conception of love is wrong because never once did Dante possess Beatrice, but never once did Dante stop loving Beatrice. So love is not about possession, it's about trust, it's about faith. That's what love is. And so rather than admit he is wrong and go to heaven by the way, Virgil is like screw this I'm going back to hell because I'm happy there. I rather burn in hell for a fraternity than admit I'm wrong. Dante, though Virgil leaving you do not yet we do not weep yet you'll need your tears for yet for what another sword must yet inflict. Beatrice says to Dante let him go let him go you can't save him you have to save yourself there's no point in trying to save those who don't want to be saved this isn't and so that this is the last we will see a Virgil and as you can understand at this point in our hearts We've also learned to let virtual go. And this means that slowly from our minds, the ineat will dissipate, will dissolve itself. And we will have a new memory called the divine comedy coming to place which will reshape the way we see the universe. Does that make sense guys? Is this clear? Any questions about this? Yeah, go ahead. No, no, no, no, I'm finished. Yeah. And then, so I am sorry about this, because I'm not. Yeah, no worries, no worries. Yeah. That's right. Okay. Yeah. That one was like a proper. Okay, so how did Virgil put Daito in hell? Okay, so this goes back to the INEAD, which everyone will have read. If you read the line in common, you must have, you will certainly have read the INEAD. So what happens in the Eniad is that Enius, a prince of Troy, he's going to Rome to basically found the Roman Empire. That is his divine mission, sent to him by the gods. But along the way, he gets shipped back on Carthage. And Diddow, who is the queen of Carthage, welcomes him and his people. And they fall in love. And then they get married. They have sex and all that. But then the gods get angry because they didn't want Ithias in Carthage. They want him in Rome. So they sent Mercury, the messenger god, to tell him, hey man, Ithias, go to Rome. And Ithias, because he's Pius. That's what he's famous for, for being Pius. He just basically says, fine. And Diddle, of course, gets very upset. And he warns Ithias, if you leave, I couldn't kill myself. I love you that much. And Ines is basically like, yeah, go kill yourself. So he leaves, and she kills herself. She basically throws herself into a, I can't remember, I think she just stops herself with a sword and then throws herself off into a fire. Okay, so Ditto is dead. Now on the way to Rome, Ines has to go through hell in order to get a prophecy of the founding of Rome. And in hell, who does he meet? He meets Ditto. And it is kind of awkward for him. And he's like, hmm, I just go say hi, OK? But the moment he tries to say hi to Ditto, Ditto runs away. And what's happened is that in hell, not only is he burning in hell, but he's lost the power to speak, which for the Greeks and the Romans was even worse than death. You've lost the power to speak. So that's what happens in the Inaad. And Garnet's continuous idea in the Divine Comedy. He's assumed that if you're reading the Divine Comedy, you've already read the Ineyad. Which, I mean, again, the Ineyad is what you have to memorize in school. Yeah, that's right. Just according to. Yeah, so yeah, so in Virgil's cosmology, Ditto has to be in hell because she's not pagan. And Ineyad is there as well. So Ineus is actually in limbo, and Ditto is in the first circle of hell. The problem, though, is that Virgil does not acknowledge Ditto. So it's like Virgil wants to block Ditto from his own mind. He's trying to ignore the fact that Ditto is his creation. He feels kind of embarrassed about all this. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. Did you have any questions? Oh yeah, yeah, that's a great question. Where these ideas limbo and purgatory come from? Okay, so what's happening is that Donnie is dealing with an entire cosmology of Christian thought, okay? Because throughout Christian history, there've been a lot of problems. One big problem is, let's just say that you're a baby and you are born before the time of Christ, okay? And you die because you're sick, okay? Well, that makes no sense. Well, then according to Christian theology, then the baby would burn in hell. That doesn't make any sense, right? Because it's a baby. He or she is without sin, and he got unlucky, right? So they create this place called Limbo for these special cases, okay? Does that make sense? Right, so that's where we get the idea of limbo from. And then purgatory is another idea that was created in order to, basically as a middle ground between hell and heaven. Okay, because there are lots of special cases where, okay, this person did some sin and so doesn't kind of access to heaven, But the sin doesn't qualify for hell, right? So they created Purgatory. So the genius of Dante is he's basically accessing all this cosmology. And there are different conflicts within this cosmology, right? And he's creating his own cosmology. So before Dante, the idea of Purgatory was not that common. But after Dante, Purgatory became a much more common concept in Christian theology. Also, if you actually read the Divine Comedy, It's clear that Don is drawing a lot of his ideas from Nazism. So in other words, what's happening is that even though the Catholic Church is strung and post-Orphanoxy on the European population, most people are actually resisting, especially the educated elite. They're resisting, and they're creating their own theology in opposition to the Catholic Church. So they all believe in Jesus, but the interpretation of Jesus is different. So one major difference in the Divine Comedy is that it's orthodoxy that Jesus died for our sins. But when Beatrice and Donte talk about Jesus, Beatrice tells Donte, no, Jesus died to awaken us, to educate us, to our own flaws. Otherwise, we could not look ourselves in the mirror. The deaf and the jitters were so shocking that it forced us to look ourselves in the mirror and to see the scene within us. It was an act of education, it was an act of inspiration rather than an act of redemption. The other thing that we didn't really discuss is that at this point in European history, This year about 1300, right? As Doug says, there's a lot of reflection going on. Like people in the Catholic Church hierarchy understand that Augustine, his theories, his theology are problematic, okay? And so what happens is that a new theology named Thomas Aquinas comes and his orthodoxy starts to replace that of Augustine. And Aquinas is a much more enlightened, much more open-minded individual than Augustinians. They're basically dealing with two different social milieus. When Augustin was around, Rome was at the height of its power. The Catholic Church was an empire. But obviously a few hundred centuries later, there was the Arabian conquest and there was the Mongolian conquest as well. So there was a lot of more self-reflection going on. And so if you look at the ideas of Thomas Aquinas and Dante, they align very closely. But what's important for us to understand is philosophy is not as effective as poetry. Philosophy is about ideas. And you can debate these ideas. But poetry goes into your subconscious and they become the building blocks of your psyche. Does that make sense? Because poetry is language. And as we discussed, it was very common back then. It was actually a great practice. For instance, people who memorized poetry, they didn't actually know what they were memorizing, but they just memorized it. And it made them much more fluent in language and much more fluid in thought. And that's a cultural practice that we no longer do to our detriment, basically. Okay, so are there any more questions before we? That's right. Right, okay. Okay, so the key idea of the Protestant Reformation is that you have direct access to God, right? And how do you access God through the Bible? Right, you need a priest to be the middleman because if there's a middleman priest, all sorts of problems are being created. Corruption is a huge issue, but also orthodoxy. And so the idea of the Protestant Reformation is that you can access God through the Bible itself. And why you're able to do that is because God is within you and you're within God. And therefore, through self-study, you're able to access truth yourself. So that's the main idea of the Protestant Reformation. Does that make sense? And then when we talk about the sign of revolution, the main idea of the sign of revolution is the individualization of doubt. What does that mean? It means we encourage you to ask questions. We encourage you to debate, because that's what God wants. And where do we get this idea from? Because in heaven, bishops and dynics are arguing all the time. It's divine to ask questions. It's divine to doubt. It's divine to experiment. Remember, the father of the sight of revolution is Galileo. Where's Galileo from? Florence, right? So Galileo grew up immersed in the divine comedy. These things aren't accidental, okay? Right? Does that make sense? But I will go into these topics and themes much more specifically next semester, okay? Any more questions? Okay, great. So I will see you guys next semester then."}

We finished a branch age today with the Indus Valley civilization. So we've done Egypt, we've done Mesopotamia, now we're doing the Indus Valley civilization. And today I'm going to look at three questions, okay? First of all, what is it that makes Indus Valley civilization distinct or different from other civilizations? Second is, why did it decline? They reached their peak about 2600 to 1900 BCE, and then for the next three to 400 years, they decline and ultimately disappear. Okay. Why that happened? The last question is, what is their legacy? What's your contribution to development of Western civilization? Okay. All right. So let's look at business value civilization. To do so, we need to first understand the world at this time. And this is about 2500 to 2000 BC. OK? This is what we call the middle Bronze Age, because most people were using bronze for weapons, for tools. So over here is Egypt. And as we discussed, by far, Egypt is the wealthiest, most advanced civilization in the Bronze Age. Over here across the Red Sea is Arabia. And even though Arabia isn't really discussed that much in world history, it's so significant because it's part of the trading network. So the Arabia, it's many nomads who take goods from Mesopotamia over to Egypt and then into the Mediterranean, which access all of Europe. This is Somar, which is the beginning of the Mesopotamian civilization. Up here is Anatolia, the Levant. And then the inner-spalic civilization is over here. And today, it would cover the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northwest India. What makes an industrial civilization important is it's really by the coast, which allows it to access Mesopotamia and Egypt, meaning during the Bronze Age, these three civilizations, Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and the industrial civilization, were heavily interconnected through trade. And in this valley civilization, what was unique to them are certain products, for example, indigo dye, which was really sought after in Mesopotamia and in Egypt. Their handicrafts, their jewelry were also very famous throughout the world. They usually traded with Sumer and Egypt by trading with the Gulf state nations of Bahrain and Oman and Dubai, okay? And they actually had a colony by the Persian Gulf, right? This civilization was so good at trading that we believe they even traded with China, okay? Which is pretty far away, but their ships were huge and they were very good navigators. As the Bronze Age developed over time, Bronze was in heavy demand, and the main components of bronze are copper and tin. Tin is mainly found in the mountains of Afghanistan over here, OK? Which meant the Indian civilization started to now expand over to Afghanistan in order to access the tin trade. So tin was really sought after. But there was also another stone called Lapis lazula, which is really sought after by the Egyptians for its spiritual and aesthetic qualities. And over here, because of the trade with Afghanistan, then we start to develop into Anatolia and Mesopotamia. And as well, because of this trade in Afghanistan, new civilizations start to develop as well. and they're not as advanced, as large, as the three major ones, but they're still pretty advanced. So for example, up here is what we call the oxys valley civilization. The technical term used by archaeologists are the bacterium Marciana archaeological complex. You don't have to know this, OK? It's called BMAC. What makes this civilization important is it interacts with the steps people, called the Androminal culture. So as you can see, the Venezuelan civilization, through its partners, the Uxish civilization, and its colonies over here, now trade with the entire world. There's no peace of the Western world. the Inescapable Isolation does not touch. Does that make sense? So this is a world of 2500 to 2000 BCE. It's a world that's heavily interconnected. And there are two major sources of demand. The Egyptians are extremely wealthy, and they want these valuable jewelry and hand-to-grass for their burials. That's one source of heavy demand. The main source of demand is actually Mesopotamia, where the city states of Sumer are fighting wars against each other. And in wars, bronze makes a huge difference because bronze armor is much more stronger than copper armor. So these two places are driving the man. And as such, the Indian values civilization is going wealthy through trade. Does that make sense? Any questions so far before I continue? So even though the Indian Civilization is connected with Egypt and Mesopotamia, it's a rapidly different civilization. So the first thing that makes Indian Civilization interesting is it's a huge area. It's actually in terms of size larger than Egypt and Mesopotamia combined. It has a population at its peak of about 5 million people. So this is a huge area. What's really interesting is we have found no evidence of any organized warfare in this region during this time. The reason why is this region is connected through trade. So what we have found is five major urban centers in the Islamic civilization. And these urban centers, you can consider to be what we call value adding processing centers. These are urban centers that specialize in digging raw goods, like metals and agricultural products, and turning them into finished products, like jewelry, handicrafts, to be shipped, to be traded with mainly Mesopotamia, but also Egypt, and possibly China as well. It also goes north to the access value civilization, which then trades with the step people, the end of culture, okay? What we know as the Yamnaya people, all right? So this trade network, it's very, very complex. And everyone is involved in some capacity in this trade network, okay? So that's the first thing that's interesting about the industrial civilization. They trade internally peacefully, they trade externally peacefully as well. We have absolutely no evidence that they ever had organized warfare. We have absolutely no evidence that they have any intention of organized warfare. Meaning we have not found any weapons. We have found tools. We found hunting weapons. We have not found maybe armor and helmets. Yeah? Yeah, great question. So how do we know there's no organized warfare? So we know there's a lot of organized warfare in Mesopotamia and other places because of what we have dug up. So we look at cities. We see parts of the city that have been built on top of or destroyed, meaning there might have been some fires or there might have been some warfare. But with these five urban centers that we dug up, we have found them pretty intact, meaning they were not built on top of or they were not destroyed when they were around. So that's the first major piece of evidence. The second major piece of evidence is we've dug up their graves. So if you look at maybe the civilizations of the endodomal culture or Mesopotamia, They tend to bury warriors with their weapons. So helmets and armor. But when we fuck up the IVC culture people, first of all, we don't find a distinct cast of warriors. Also, we don't find any helmets or armor or weapons. So that's what led us to believe they don't engage in organized warfare. But there's also evidence to suggest our evidence is not solid. The first piece of evidence is, they don't bury their dad. These people don't have a tradition of burying their dad. Some are buried, but not everyone is buried. Second of all, we don't know where they buried their dad. We assume they buried their dad in the cities, but that may not be true. So the evidence leans towards, they were a peaceful civilization. But as we dig up more and more over time, we may discover this was not true. But right now the MN suggests they were peaceful. And also what's really important about the IBC, the Innocent Valley civilization is, this is a new discovery. We've only known about them for the past 100 years. So what's interesting is, the Indians themselves never knew they existed. It was the British who discovered these cities and start the work in archeology to start to reconstruct their civilization. But thanks for the question. So as I said, the first thing that's interesting about their civilization is it was relatively peaceful, compared with what's happening in Mesopotamia. The second thing that was interesting for us is, and surprising is, for a very large civilization, They are egalitarian. Meaning in Mesopotamia, when we look at these old cities, Ur and Uruk, there were these huge palaces and temples which suggested a culture of power in the priesthood and in the king. But when we look at these five urban centers of the IBC, there are no palaces, there are no temples. In fact, these cities are extremely well-designed. There are these walls around the city, and then as you go into the city, you're able to access every single part of the city. But if you were to go into a city, say in Sumer, if you go into the city, you're only able to access the temple or the palace. So authority is centralized and in Sumer, whereas authority is sort of decentralized in the IVC. Now here's a question. If we suspect they are not engaged in warfare, why do they have walls? There are a lot of walls inside these cities. Why are there walls? Can anyone guess? Okay, customs, taxes, okay? Meaning this is again a value added, adding process center and the way they survive economically is by collecting tolls and customs on people who trade. And the way they collect taxes is when you enter the city, you have to go to the customs house and then you pay whatever is required of you and then you can access the city, okay? And that's the way they centralized, centrally controlled the economy and trade in the IBC. These cities are amazing. These are the first people to invent the seat toilet, the private seat toilet. This is about the year 2800 BCE. So when you go into the cities, you'll find that in private homes, everyone has a private toilet. And then the thesis is put into a switch system, and the water flushes it out. That's pretty amazing. These are people who are very concerned about the well-being of all its citizens. So when we look at skeletal remains through DNA analysis, we've discovered the majority of the people ate about the same high quality of food. There wasn't these disparities between people, as you would find in other civilizations. At least half the people we think live past the age of 55. That was an amazing achievement back then. In terms of innovation, they have reservoirs. They also have public baths. They also have really amazing things called wind towers. I'm not sure if you've studied these wind towers, but they're basically air conditioners. What they do is, these are high towers, and there is a hole on top, right? So what happens is, the higher the air is, the cooler it is, right? So this wind that's cool gets trapped into the wind tower. It comes down and it pushes out the hot air from the other side. And this is what cools the houses in the summer. This is pretty advanced technology. Another really cool thing about the IVC is even though it covers a huge area, they have standardized weights and measurements. They have standardized weights and measurements. Which means that every brick that they have is the same size. Which means that their buildings, their structures are extremely stable and resilient. That's why 5,000 years later, we still have their cities intact. You can actually go to the cities and live in them. That's how stable the technology was. So this is a pretty advanced civilization. Unfortunately, we don't know what their writing system is. So if they had writing, and we can't know for sure if they had writing, it was like Chinese in the ideogramic language, meaning it is not phonological. They're speaking, the spoken language is not the same as the written language. In other words, it is impossible for us to decipher their written language. We don't have that many artifacts of writing. We have seals with characters written on them. But we don't have anything else. And the reason could be, if you look at Egypt, they use papyrus. Papyrus is stable, or it keeps in a dry Egyptian ear. If you look at Sumerian culture, Mesopotamian culture, they use canine form on clay tablets, which keeps forever. But if they had a writing system and they did write, it would be on palm leaves, which degrades very easily in the jungle ear. So we don't have access to their writing. This is problematic because without access to their writing, we don't have access to their religion. We don't know what the religion is. And one thing that you've learned in this class that's very important is religion or mythology, it is the operating system of the culture. It is the collective consciousness, the collective worldview that gives life to their culture. It explains why they do what they do. And unfortunately, we don't know their religion. But so it's a complete mystery to archaeologists, to scholars, as to why this very advanced civilization was very peaceful and very egalitarian. We're going to speculate. Any questions so far before I continue? OK, so I'm going to speculate as to why they were peaceful in the Gatarian. So again, the key is the religion. What is the religion? Because that will give us clues as to their mentality, their value system. We know that the Mesopotamian people, their religion focus on struggle and achievement. We know that the Egyptians, their religion focus on the afterlife. This life that we live is, what's important is not the here and now, what's important is what happens afterwards. And that's why the Egyptians built the pyramid. That's why they focus so much on funeral rites and on burial goods. So there had to be religion in the IBC that was different from the belief system in Sumer in Egypt that made it into a peaceful and a gattern civilization. All right, so what is this religion and why were they different? My speculation is this, the key is to understand that this is a civilization based on trade. And they've been traders ever since they were born as a culture, meaning they were trading for at least 7,000, 8,000 years before they became a civilization. And if you're a trader, first of all, you're able to access the entire world. So we know for a fact they traded with Sumer and the Persian Gulf states because we have artifacts from the IBC in these places. We know for a fact. We can speculate it. They also traded with Egypt and with China just based on their technology and their trade networks. So this is a civilization based on trade. And as traders, they're able to see what's going on in Mesopotamia and Egypt. They know they built the pyramids in Egypt. They know there's massive warfare in Sumer. And I would think that if you were a trader and you saw these things, you wouldn't be impressed. Okay? In fact, you might be disgusted, especially by the warfare in Mesopotamia. This idea called the dialectic, right? And I think this is a very important idea for us to appreciate how history is often driven by the idea of the dialectic. So an example that we have in today's world is you look at Japan and China, okay? These are two radically different societies that are next to each other. And the question then is, why are they still different? I think the answer is because Japan knows China very well. And a lot of cultural practice, Japan developed over the centuries, have been in response to what they see as feelings or successes in Chinese culture. Another example that Doug will appreciate is Canada and the United States. The United States is probably the most belligerent nation in the world, okay? They cannot get their hands off anything. And then you go north, Canada, and you know, Canada and the United States share the world's longest border. Basically, Canadians are cousins of the Americans, okay? I mean like, there's really no difference. We speak the same language, we have the same cultural practices. But while Americans are the most belligerent nation ever in human history, Canadians invented peacekeeping, Okay, the idea like nations should strive for meditation and peace, okay? And I think a lot of Canada, a lot of Canadian values, especially its political system, is in response to what it believes to be failings and successes in the American model. Okay, you also have New Zealand and Australia. So there are many different examples of the dialectic going on in our global political systems. And I believe that's what happened with the IBC, where these traders saw what's happening in Egypt and saw what's happening in Mesopotamia, and they were kind of disgusted, especially by all this warfare in Mesopotamia. Warfare back then was pretty awful. And so in Mesopotamia, the way they fight is they fight with these play bullets. Okay? And you take a slingshot and you throw it at someone. And these things kill, they hurt. So think of David and Goliath, okay? And if you're a traitor, you know, you'll see this warfare going on. You'll see people being beheaded. And while they're doing this, they're doing it in the name of God. Every city-state has a patron god that it believes it must defend and honor and protect. And whenever there's a dispute, it's because they feel their god has been dishonored by another city-state, so they go to war and they kill each other. And again, if you're a traitor and you see this, you don't think this is a good thing. And you go to Egypt and you see these pyramids, and these pyramids are, again, extremely impressive. But at the same time, you also see the consequences of these pyramids, which is this massive inequality, massive corruption, this massive waste. So I think that by trading with these two civilizations and other civilizations, it reinforces the deep cultural values of the IBC people. And it basically compels them towards peace and egalitarianism. That's what I believe happened. Now, there are other arguments. For example, maybe these people are just genetically peaceful and egalitarian. But I've made the argument in this class that from the onset of early human history, we were peaceful and egalitarian people. But different geographic circumstances changed our outlook. So for example, the people in the steps, what we call the Amire people, because of the grasslands, because it is such a poor and rugged and unforgiving environment. They're forced to be cattle ranchers. They're forced to engage in cattle raiding. And over time, their culture became very aggressive, expansionist, and opportunistic. Opportunistic just means they'll do whatever it needs to survive. If they face a, they'll trade with people. If it's that, if that's what benefits them, they'll kill people if that's what benefits them. They are not that moral, okay? They're very opportunistic. And I remember, as I said, these people with their cultural values would go in and conquer all of Europe in about 200, 300 years, okay? And they will call the Anaya people. Back in the steps, these Anaya people continue to evolve over time. And over time, they became more aggressive, more expansionist, and more opportunistic. Eventually, the Mongols, Genghis Khan and Mongols, will come from the civilization. So that's my argument to you. And again, it's my speculation. It is because of the interaction of other cultures that convinced them to pursue a peaceful and egalitarian lifestyle. Now, there are still inequalities in IBC. We know there are classes. We know there's wealth inequality. But relative to Mesopotamia and Egypt, it was a relatively peaceful and egalitarian society. Any questions before I continue? Okay, so the question is, were they invaded the IBC? Because as we discussed in previous classes, When you're peaceful in a Gatian society, we know that old Europe, okay, before the Amni invasion was a peaceful and Gatian society, you will eventually get invaded by other cultures. And for the longest time, there was a theory out there first proposed by basically the Nazis, okay, called the Indo-Aryan invasion. The idea is you have these white people sweep into India, conquer the people, and introduce civilization to the Indians. This is called the Indo-Aryan Invasion. Even though this theory has been discredited, there is a slight kernel of truth to this theory which I will explain to you. So let me explain this theory and what happened. So you have the IVC, which is a very advanced civilization. The problem with civilization is, the entire economy is basically based on trade. Right? Now we know in about, there's something called the 4.2-kilo-year event, which is basically a massive climate change around the world. And the four two-point year killer event brought basically an end to the Egypt-O Kingdom. It also brought an end to what we call the Akkadian Empire in Sumer. A man named Sorgon of Akkad conquered all of Sumer and built the Akkadian Empire. And because of this drought, because of climate change, his empire collapsed. So in other words, trade networks that the IBC heavily dependent on start to collapse. And as a result, their cities now, which are dependent on trade, start to depopulate, meaning a lot of people start to return to the farms where they are from. They start also migrating to the rest of India, to the Ganges. Okay? As well, because of this kind of change, the IVC itself is being affected heavily. Okay? So there's drought, the rivers are drying up. Remember, like the Invisibilization is called Invisibilization because it's dependent on the Indus River, among other rivers. Okay? So there are some drought issues. Also, what we learned in this class is over time, all civilizations face eternal tensions. And these eternal tensions can be divided into two major tensions. The first tension is a conflict among the classes. So the idea of elite overproduction, you have too many people striving for limited status. And the conflict is mainly between upper nobility and lower nobility. And so here in the IBC, we can imagine a conflict might be between these families that are large training houses against families that are small training houses. Or it could be internally among the families. But there's going to be some social tension going on. The other social tension that we discussed is that of rat utopia. And it's basically conflict between the old and the young. Again, the problem with the IBC is you have too many old people living for too long, which means less opportunities arise for achievement for the young. And that creates conflict as well. So what we believe that it also is that during this time, there was massive social tension within the IBC. And some people would even say it was a revolutionary time when all customs and all more were being over thrown. Because of climate change, the people in the Angelova culture now are forced to lead the steps, because the steps are no longer suitable for their lifestyle. So they push into the oxen's vales civilization. And over time, they will assimilate it into themselves. So the idea here is this is not an intentional invasion. It's not that you have a general army, and they go into the Oxis Validation and then they conquer it. It's more opportunistic, where at first the trading, and as the Oxis Validation declines because of the declining trade networks, they will start to come in and push out the people. And again, the culture of these people, it's very aggressive. So there are two strategies that they will employ. The first strategy is they might wipe out villages. These villages are depopulated anyway. They come in and they wipe everyone out, which means they kill everyone. The second strategy is to come in, they'll kill all the men and marry all the women. Again, this is a gradual process of assimilation, cultural conquest. But it's not a military invasion. Does that make sense? Now, after the internal culture and the oxys' culture merge, this creates a new civilization, a new culture called proto-indo-uranian. Why's it called that? Because now what they will do is they'll go south to the Iranian plateau and they will become eventually the Persian people. And they will invent a new religion that becomes a great world religion called Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism comes from this merger of the Polo-Iranian culture into the Iranian plateau. This is a process we call synchronization, by the way. Synchronization, where two major religions merge and share the same gods. And there are three distinct characteristics of the proto-Indo-Iranian culture that becomes salient in the new Zoroastrian religion. The first is the use of a ritual drink called soma. Soma. Again, you don't have to know this, but I'm just telling you the cultural impact. Soma comes from the proto-Indo Iranian culture. Second is the worship of fire, okay? Fire rituals. Fires are used heavily in the religious practice, okay? And as we know, Zoroastrianism does use a lot of fire rituals. The last is horse sacrifice, meaning that warriors are buried with their horses. And so this is an emphasis on the warrior culture of these people. So that's what happens in Iran. They become the Persian people. We will discuss the Persian people at a later point. Not now, but I just want you to know this is what happened. These people will also push into the IBC. And over time, and this is a process that takes about 500 years, they'll push out the indigenous people. And then the indigenous people move into South India where they merge with the folk culture, the animism of the local people there. And guys, what's amazing about this is this process will create two major world religions that are still influential today. The first we know as Hinduism. Hinduism is the merger, the synchronization of proto-Indo-Iranian religion with the local full IVC religion. And as the IVC pushes south, this will create a new religion called Buddhism. But Buddhism is just the major one. There are others that are being created as well through this process. The others are being Jainism and Shikism. And again, these are the major ones that are still with us today. Like basically, this process created thousands, tens of thousands of new religions. So this is what happened. It's not a military conquest. It's not an invasion. But it's a process of, you could argue, cultural genocide. Where new people come in and over time, because they are aggressive, experienced, opportunistic culture, they will eventually take over the culture. Mainly by marrying the local woman, because the people who come in are basically males. They will marry the local woman, and they will either kill or enslave the local man. And this is where we get the caste system from in India. So this is a more subtle explanation of the Indo-Iran invasion theory. And this is what scholars today accept happen. And again, what's really important is to avoid generalizations and simplifications, because this is a process that took about 200 years, 40 years, and there are different strategies employed by different people. Somebody was peaceful, somebody was violent. It was a mix. It's hard for us to generalize. But the overall general effect is the creation of Hinduism and Buddhism, which now are the two major world religions. Any questions? But thanks for the question, Niko. Any more questions before I move on? Actually, you can ask because I'll have some time to rest. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay. So that's a great question to dub. So when you trade, there's always a problem of piracy and benign tree. So how do you protect yourselves against that? Okay, we know like Mesopotamia became violent because it was being surrounded by violence, right? The nomads in Arabia, the nomads in the Zagros Mountains were all pretty violent people. You had to be because to survive, you had to be aggressive and opportunistic. So how was it the, sorry, the IVC was able to be peaceful, yet at the same time trade? And the solution is they set up the colonies and trade partners in order to facilitate trade. Okay? So we know for example, they traded heavily with the oxen civilization. There were lots of trade agreements, long-term trade agreements. We also know that a colony within the oxen civilization. Okay? We know they traded heavily with a place called Dilman which is now modern day Borat. Okay? So these are the main trading partners. And so you would think there are training partners were the ones who were responsible for local security. We can also suspect they also went to other places as well to seek new training partners. What's important about this world is this is still a relatively peaceful world. There's tremendous violence in Sumer, but that's still rare, right? And there's some unique characteristics about Sumer that make it a violent people. But in this world, and this is about 5,000 years ago, people are still relatively peaceful. Organized warfare is still new and rare in the human experience. And that's why I think the experience in Mesopotamia was so shocking. Because the idea that you could sack a city, the idea that you could kill hundreds of people at one time, That's like breaking a massive culture taboo. So I think culturally speaking, people at this time prefer to trade rather than to fight. And because they've been training for such a long time, or talking like they start maybe trading about 7,000, 6,000 BCE, they have a lot of trading networks around the world. They have partners they can trust basically. Any more questions before I continue? You may be one more, but I'm actually into Buddhism. But any more questions before I continue? Okay, so the last thing I want to discuss is what is the legacy of the IBC? They were a great civilization or they completely lost to us. What is your contribution to Western civilization? So the legacy of Egypt are the pyramids, right? We know Egypt because of the pyramids. The legacy of Mesopotamia are many. They met a lot of things like like writing, Konea form. Also, they introduced world literature, the Epic of Gilgamesh. What I want to argue now is the legacy of the IVC is in their spiritual practice, their spiritual values. So if you look at Hinduism, it's very different from Zoroastrianism. And that's kind of strange because they're both proto-Indo-Iranian religions, right? But let's look at very quickly at Hinduism. Hinduism believes the reality we live in is false. Okay? The real reality is called Brahman, the true absolute reality. So we live in this false reality. As we live in this false reality, we collect karma. You are basically just an accounting of your good deeds and your bad deeds. And guess what? Throughout your life, you're going to accumulate more bad deeds than your good deeds. And your karma means your soul, called the admin, is stuck here, okay? Because the brahmin is peer. You can only return to brahmin, to heaven, if you're a peer person. So it will take many lifetimes for you to cleanse your soul, your admin, in order to return to the Brahmin. This process of cleansing your soul is what they call dharma, dharma, the right path. If the dharma over thousands of lifetimes, if your dharma is correct, if you achieve dharma, you achieve what is called moksha, which is basically liberation. releases you, your soul from the physical world, and allows you to return to the Brahmin where you will live eternally in paradise. Okay? That is the one of the basic ideas of Hinduism. Another really important idea of Hinduism is this entire process is being meditated or mediated or gatekeep by priests called Brahmins. So you think being a good person is enough. No it's not. You have to listen to the Brahmin because only the Brahmin understands dharma and depending on who you are your dharma will be different. So in Hinduism there's a hierarchy. At the very top are of course the priests, the Brahmin, because they have access to spiritual knowledge. Below them are the warriors and the kings. And then below them are the farmers and the merchants who keep the economy running. And at the very bottom are the servants and the laborers. Now what's really interesting about the system is this system can be differentiated by the color of one's skin. Because remember, the polo-indoeranians, they have white skin. The IVC culture, the people who call the pro-Gervanians, they have darker skin. So the IVC people of the lower class don't intermix with the polo-indoeranians. So basically the polo-indoeranians accumulated and centralized power through the idea of Hinduism. Okay? They're the priest class. So that's a basic theory of Hinduism. Again, Hinduism is an extremely complex religion. I don't want to oversimplify it, but I have no choice because I want to explain the differences. Okay? So in this system, who's really unhappy now? In this system, which group of people are like very upset with this system? Can you guys echo? Can you apply what we've learned in the semester and answer the question? All of these four groups, who's the unhappiest and who most wants change or revolution change? Excuse me? The lower nobility in this system? The kings, okay? Doesn't make sense. The kings actually in the system are the lower nobility. The upper nobility are the Brahmins. Because it gives us the Brahmins who control access to the Brahmins. And so the kings must obey the priests. So the kings aren't happy with this. And so from this conflict, you have the creation of Buddhism, right? Remember, Saratha Kothama, who is considered the first Buddha, he was actually a prince before he became the Buddha. And the man most responsible for spreading Buddhism in India and around the world, His name is Ashoka. He was the king, the emperor of the Morian Empire. And he was the one who institutionalized Buddhism as state religion, who sponsored mission projects to China, to Greece, to Egypt. So these rulers don't like Hinduism because they see the Brahmin class as a threat to their power. So Buddhism follows this system except for one major difference. You don't need the brahmins to access nirvana. You don't need the brahmins to access spiritual enlightenment. You can do it by yourself through spiritual guidance by monks. That's a major difference. And as you can see, Buddhism is, in many respects, a revolutionary religion to overthrow the power of the Brahmin class. And in response to Buddhism, what did the Brahminists do? Do you guys know? They quit the caste system, okay? After the rise of Buddhism, Hinduism started to implement what we call today the caste system. Which is to say, these classes must separate from each other. They are not allowed to enumingo. They're not even allowed to touch each other. They're not even allowed to touch each other's food. These people at the very bottom are going to be called to the untouchables. And the system was developed by the Hindu priests, the Brahmins, in response to the threat of Hinduism. Now over time, because Hinduism, like the proto-Iranian people, are aggressive, expeditious, opportunistic, they would defeat Buddhism in the struggle. No, one really important way they defeat Buddhism is by adopting most of Buddhism's practices, OK? So like yoga meditation and also Nirvana. The Hindu Brahmins will adopt whatever is popular in Buddhism. Another thing that the Hindu priests will do is they will start basically assimilating other religions as well. So most Indians, throughout its history, believe in their local folk lord gods. Eventually all these gods will be assimilated into the Hindu hierarchy. That's why you have like a million gods in the Hindu religion, because they're all over time assimilated into the hierarchy. And obviously, these gods are lesser gods. The higher gods, the holy trinity are grammar gods. All right, so now's the chance for Doug to ask his question about Buddhism if I continue. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah, yeah. OK, great question, OK? So what is the IVC religion, the proto-religion? Okay, I want to make an argument. And again, it's speculation. It's a very strange argument. And most scholars probably will not agree. I think the religion of the IBC is proto-Buddhism. And the reason why is if you look at Zoroastrianism and you look at Proto-Indo Iranian, the religion, there are a lot of similarities, okay? And proto-Zoroastrianism actually fits into the larger Proto-Indo-European religion framework. When you look at Hinduism, you've got this strange idea. You believe in karma, dharma, reincarnation, impermanence, drama, the ultimate reality. Like this is that part of the Proto-Indo-European religion in anywhere, OK? So, at the same time, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism all share this fundamental belief in the world, that this world is a false reality. It's a reality created by our false beliefs. And if we learn to tame our emotions, if we learn to see the underlying reality governing all human structure, then we will be released from this world, okay? Now, where would that come from? That must have come from the IBC, because there will be no other place. Also it explains why these religions have such huge followings in India, right? They don't have any followings anywhere else, okay? Like Hinduism is basically localized to India, so it's Jnism, so it's Shikinism. So they are appealing to a fundamental sense of the world among Indians. They're basically appealing to nostalgia. And where is this nostalgia from? It must be from the IVC. So I would make that argument. I would believe, I would bet, that if we're able to construct the religion of the IVC, the proto-religion, we would see a proto-Buddhism, the beginnings of Buddhism. It would be very different, because Buddhism evolved over 1,000 years. But the underlying assumptions about the world, basically the idea of oneness, the idea of false reality. I think these two ideas would be very apparent in the IVC, as they are apparent now in all four major Indian religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jnism, and Shikism. Do you want to continue? Or no, no, no, no, I'm finished. But do you want to respond to my argument? And are you guys following along? Does this make sense to you guys? In fact, I would argue that we as humans fundamentally have a nostalgia for these two ideas, oneness and false reality. Because if you look at the West, if you look at us today, there are two ideas that are the most powerful today in Western civilization. The first idea is Plato's Allegory of the Cave. The idea that we live in a shallow world, and the truth is out there, but we have to seek it. It's a very powerful idea. And it's very similar, by the way, to the ideas found in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Allegory of the Cave is the first powerful idea. And then the second powerful idea is the idea of the Second Coming, the return of Jesus. Because what does the return of Jesus signify? It signifies paradise on earth. It signifies the destruction of our current reality and the replacement of a new reality that creates oneness, completeness, and wholeness on earth. So in many ways, this is very similar to what the Indians are proposing as well. So what this is saying is, at a fundamental level, everyone has a nostalgia for a distant past. And what is this distant past? The distant past is the idea of animism. So remember, 10,000 years ago, 20,000 years ago, we were in the Ice Age. We were hunter-gatherers. The way we saw the world was very different from the way we see the world today. Back then, if you were a hunter-gatherer, you could only think you were the same as the tree, or as the animal. It's the idea of oneness. We're no different. We're all part of the life cycle. We're all part of Mother Nature, the Mother Goddess. We also believe we inhabit different realities at the same time. We live in this world, which is the material reality, but we're also inhabiting the spiritual reality as well. And what we do spiritually matters a lot more than what we do materially, so we can cut and kill animals as long as we pay the proper respects to the animals we kill as long as we contribute spiritually to the cycle of life and death. So I think cycle of life and death. So I think that's where Buddhism comes from. It comes from animism. This Buddhism became reinforced and became much more concrete because it was experiencing a reality in Mesopotamia and Egypt that was abhorrent to the people experiencing. War goes against the human experience. inequality and corruption in ways goes against the human experience. We fundamentally believe this to be evil and wrong. Okay? So that is my argument about the IBC. Any questions? Any comments? Okay, that's a good question. Do I believe that human nature is fundamentally benevolent? I don't believe human nature is benevolent. I believe humans naturally seek a spiritual understanding of the world. I think humans want to know why. Why are we here? Where are we going? Where do we come from? We want to know why. We're also curious. We want to explore the world. So I think trade is not a new invention. I think it's a very inherent thing to human nature. I think the idea of globalization, This was a globalized world like 5,000 years ago. Extremely sophisticated, complex, globalized world. So I think that's what makes us fundamentally human. And you can say this is a good thing or a bad thing. And I would say, well, it depends on the circumstance. But I think what drives us as humans is our curiosity and our imagination. That's what I think being human is. And sometimes this is a good thing. Sometimes this is a bad thing. Sometimes in the IBC, this will lead to peace and egalitarianism. But this also is what drives the idea of the second coming, which is what's driving the conflict in the Middle East today. So it depends on the context. It depends on the circumstance. If this curiosity, this imagination, is channeled effectively, then I think that's a good thing. which channel, opportunistically, then it's a bad thing. Okay, thanks for the question. Any more questions? Okay, so this ends our branch H unit, okay? So we looked at the three major branch H civilizations, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and IVC. Next class, we'll start the Bible, okay? The Hebrew Bible. All right."}

Today we do Sigmund Freud. First what I will do is I will put Freud in the context of the Western religious intellectual and literary tradition. Alright, so in the beginning the main religion for us humans during the Ice Age was animism. Okay, and The idea of animism is that we humans are no different from every other living conscious being in the world. We are like the trees, we are like the animals, we're all interconnected together. And life is just a cycle of life and death, birth and rebirth. And this is, this religion is still around today in many primitive societies, for example on the Amazon. And then we transitioned to the mother goddess. So as we became more agricultural, fertility was more and more important. We needed to have more children and we needed to grow more crops. And so we began to worship the mother goddess and women were very high status at this stage in history. But as populations grew and towns came to being, They came into competition with each other. They started to war against each other. This created polytheism. Polytheism is the idea that each place has its own God that's its patron. And when these places come into conflict and war, the way they settle disputes is the losing party, their God becomes servant to the winning God. And this creates the idea of the pantheon that we see in Greek, Roman mythologies, as well as Norse mythologies. Now, the radical break from this tradition was the birth of monotheism. Now, there's going to be a lot of scholarly debate about which was the first monotheistic religion. Some say there are certain Egyptian cults that were monotheistic. Some say the Jews were. Some say the Zoroastrians were. In this class, what you learn is actually it was the Christians who were the first true monotheistic religion. And the reason why is the Christians introduce the idea of the Holy Trinity. All right, okay. Remember what the Holy Trinity is. The Holy Trinity, the idea is God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. These are different entities, but they are co-equal to each other. They are separate but unified. They are different but equal. And this idea, it's very hard for us to logically reconcile. The only way for us to understand this is if God is both nothing and everything. Therefore, it excludes everything. There can be no other God with our God. This is the idea of monotheism. And the power of monotheism is that for the first time in human history, it creates the idea of the individual. Because when God has everything, you have a direct connection with God. And it removes you from the community. Okay? Now, this will create a lot of problems in the future. But at this point in history, remember, monotheism is being promoted by the Roman Empire as a way to consolidate its rule over its vast territory. At this stage in history, this is not a problem. The reason why is mediating you and God is the Catholic Church. But not only that, the Catholic Church mediates God for everyone. So in this way, the church creates its own community. So at this stage in history, this is not a problem. But remember, the church becomes corrupt, and there are many religious reformers who believe that you don't really need the church in order to access God. In fact, you have a more imperative to access God directly through the Bible. You have to read the Bible by yourself, and you have to interpret it properly. Okay? And so obviously the most similar reform is Martin Luther. Now this is important because what will happen is by living in the church, you create direct access to God, and this creates the idea of crisis in faith. The idea of crisis in faith is, how do you truly know as a person whether or not you love God. And how do you know God loves you? Think about your mother, right? You know your mother loves you and you know you love your mother, but there are many days when you really hate your mother and you fight with your mother, okay? So it's hard for us not to doubt ourselves. And so this creates the question in faith because in partisanism, You are required to show absolute faith and devotion in God. If you doubt, if you hesitate, you will be condemned to hell. So this great idea of crisis and faith. Historically, there have been many solutions to this problem. Different profits are proposed different solutions. So let's look at three different solutions. So the first solution is the idea of wealth accumulation. So these are the Calvinists, right? They argue that to show your true faith in God and for you to prove to yourself, God truly loves you, you make a lot of money, right? That is a testament to the power of your faith, wealth accumulation. So that's one solution. It's a very popular solution. It's what gives us capitalism today. The second solution is that if G had, you will die for your faith. you'll sacrifice yourself to promote the truth of God. All right, that's also a solution. And then there's one more solution that we will discuss today. And it's hard for us to truly understand. So I'm gonna take some time to explain it fully, okay? This is the idea of transgression. So let me explain it to you slowly. The idea is this. You must demonstrate complete and absolute faith in God to be one of the elect, to go to heaven. To do so, you must demonstrate courage. You must demonstrate financialism. The best way to do that is to prove yourself to God by rejecting the laws of man, by rejecting human morality, by rejecting social taboos, breaking social taboos actually demonstrate your faith in God. All right, now I know this sounds like a strange idea, but let me give you an example to show you what this means. Let's just say that in school I decided to start a new class, and this new class is called Individual Empowerment. And my very first assignment to all my students is I want you guys to go shoplift. I want you guys to go steal a piece of candy from a small store. And of course, you are disgusted and you are pulled by this suggestion. What do you get caught? Well, you might get expelled from school. You might be jailed. Your parents may punish you. You may be outcast from society. And then I tell you, have faith. Trust me, when you do this and you break the social taboo that's preventing you from realizing your full potential, you will feel an extreme sense of exhalation, liberation, excitement. And this will motivate you to do greater things in life by breaking taboos, by transgression against society, and showing your true faith in God, you will master your destiny, okay? And so you guys go and you go steal something from the store, you get away with it, and guess what? You feel excited, you feel exhilarated, you feel energized, okay? And that's the idea of transgression. And this has always been a very, This has been around for us for hundreds of years as well. So these are the three main ways that historically, the religious practitioners have tried to resolve the issue of the crisis of faith. Wealth accumulation, that's commonness, jihad, and you also have transgression. Remember transgression, it's very important for discussion. So remember this idea. Now, another way to resolve the question of faith is through philosophy, epistemology. Epistemology. Epistemology really just means the theory of knowledge. How do ideas come together? What does knowledge come from? How do we know what we know? Because the question of faith is essentially how do we know? So, FSMology is really philosophy's attempt to resolve this crisis in faith. Remember before we discussed Kant. Kant proposed the idea of active subjectivity. Active subjectivity is the idea that we are not just passive consumers of information. We actively participate in reality. we imagine reality in a way that allows us to understand it. What Kant tells us is we imagine space and time onto reality, which creates a word of appearance for us to understand. The problem with Kant is what is reality? And Kant doesn't know. In fact, he tells us it is impossible to truly understand reality. And this goes to problem because if that's a case, then how do we know if reality exists or not? It's entirely possible that we are in a computer simulation. So Hegel comes along and resolves this issue by introducing the idea of the Geist. The Geist, the spirit, the mind. He argues that this is the manifestation of God that is the underlying basis of all reality. And from this reality comes material world. What will then happen is that Marx will come along and he will argue that Geist is really history. Hegel believes that the Geist is in a process of reconciling itself with the world. It's becoming the world and it's bringing us along with it so that one day everyone will achieve full enlightenment. Marx inverts Hegel and puts the material world before the world of ideas. And he argues that history, it is a movement of class struggle. And the end of history is when all class struggle ceases and we all become equal in a workers' paradise. Why? Because as capitalism becomes worse and worse. As the Polaterid increase in number, but are exploited in greater, but are oppressed by the capitalist, eventually the Polaterid, you and me, will develop class consciousness. And we will unite and we will overflow the capitalist class through collective action. So this is Marx. Now today we will study Freud because what will happen is Freud will come along and he will present a completely different conception of the movement of history and of the individual. He argues that the individual is really just unconscious forces embedded within the brain. So these three forces are the superego, the ego, and the id. The ego is who we think we are. The superego are these social forces that act upon us. And the id are these hidden sexual urges. And what he will argue is, actually, these hidden sexual urges are the two foundations of who we are, as well as of civilization. And he names two of them. The first is what is called the Edepo, the Edepo complex. And the second is Electro complex. So remember that Edepo is a character from Greek mythology, a king who killed his father and married his mother. Electro is also a character from Greek mythology, a woman who wanted to kill her mother and marry his father. Lecture is from the Ischulis play the Orestia. Freud was remarkably well read in good mythology as well as world literature. So he argues these are the two fundamental bases of who we are. If you're a man, you are the edible complex. If you're a woman, you have the electro complex. Okay, now, this is all strange because Kant makes sense, Hegel makes sense, Marx makes sense, and they all seem to flow from each other. And then you have Freud, okay? So the question then is, where did he get this idea? Where's this from? How did he develop this idea? All right, so we'll look at this question in great detail today. All right, so everyone's only knew that Freud's theory of unconscious is problematic. And he had a very famous student, his best student, his hair parent named Carl Jung. And Carl Jung really saw Freud as a father and he worshipped Freud. And he wanted to improve on Freud's theory of the unconscious. And over time, what Carl Jung will do is he will systemize this idea. Okay, so for Carl Jung, we have the ego. And the ego is made up of two forces, the conscious force and the subconscious. The subconscious is also divided into the personal as well as the collective. Sorry, it's not subconscious, unconscious, okay? Unconscious. So the personal unconscious are just our memories or experiences. The collective unconscious is the collection of all societies, memories, and experiences. And they are captured and expressed whenever we engage in society, when we eat the food, when we talk to people, when we watch movies, when we read books. the collective unconscious is embedded through society, you breathe it like you would breathe air. Okay? So, sorry, Ewan also says that we have the animus and the anima. In other words, we, sorry, in other words, we are made up of two opposing forces, the male and the female. There's a duality to us. So when we meet people, the ego projects a persona. The personas is basically our best self in a certain social context. So in school, you're a student and you try to be the best student. At home, you're a daughter. At McDonald's, you're a friend. So you are different personas in different social contexts. Now, we try to protect our best self, But we are made up of a lot of bad memories, bad thoughts. So the ego suppresses the worst aspects of us in a shadow form, okay? So the shadows really the alter ego of the ego. And this, Yun argues, is what is called the self. All right. And what he tells us is, Life is a constant process of self-discovery. If you truly wanna master yourself, you must discover who you are, and that will take a lifetime of self-exploration, guided by a psychotherapist. And this sounds much more logical, right? And it's become really the standard model for modern day psychology. Now, you would think that Freud would be happy that Koyong came up with this new idea on how to improve his theory. But Freud was infuriated that Jung would question his theory. In fact, Freud was notorious for being control freak. He excommunicated Jung, refused to have anything to do with him. In fact, everyone in the community around Freud were now, this is themselves, from Koryang. And there would be no reconciliation between the two ever. And that's why Koryo had to go and develop this theory. So it's strange because all Koryo is trying to do is improve Freud. So that gives us the second question. Why was Freud so afraid of criticism? Why was he so secretive? And then the third question that we will look at today is, why does this idea become so popular? In fact, the ideas of Freud and Coeulon will become the basis of a major cultural movement called modernism. And modernism is the cultural movement that we still live in today. Now, there are many different definitions of modernism, but for us, the easiest definition is cult of the self. We live in a world, in a society, in a culture is obsessed with ourselves, with self-improvement, with self-empowerment, all right? So we will look at where this came from, okay? So the third question we're looking at today is, first of all, we just forget this idea for the edible complex. Second is, why was Freud so secretive? And the third question is, what explains Freud's popularity? Why was he so influential? And why was his influence able to spread so quickly? And what I will show you today is Freud became so influential and so famous, not because his psychoanalysis system was designed to help his patients. Ultimately, his system was designed to protect the interests of powerful interests, powerful men. Okay, that's my argument to you today. Okay, so having made the general argument, what I want to do now is look at the evidence to support the argument. Okay, so again, this is a chart that summarizes the different perspectives of these four major thinkers, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Freud. Okay, so to summarize the main ideas, Freud believes that our sexual urges is what underpins our identity as well as civilization. It's because we cannot control sexual urges that gives rights to religion, which helps us cope with our guilt. He also believes that truth lies and our suppressed memories. And in his framework, God has abandoned us. There's really no God in his system. We are left to fend for ourselves. were left to deal with the trauma of being alone. All right, so let's put Freud in his historical context. So Freud lived and worked at the end of the 19th century, primarily in Vienna. And at this time, Europe was going through fundamental social, cultural, economic, political change. We were transitioning from the pre-modern era to the modern era. Before, we lived primarily in towns and villages where we dealt with each other emotionally. And we had a purpose in our community. But when we moved to the cities, it is money and the clock that regulates our life. And it's still true today, right? So when you come to school, what controls your behavior? It's your grades as well as the clock, right? If you are late for class, if you're absent, then your grades get deducted. So it's the same concept as we have today. All right. Now, because of these social changes, two new fields, sociology and psychology, are developed in order to try to understand what these changes mean for us as humans. So in the field of sociology, there are three major thinkers, pioneers of this time, Max Weber, ML Durkheim, and this man, George Simmel. And George Simmel wrote a wonderful essay called Metropolis and Mental Life, in which he describes what the impact of moving to the city has on people. So we'll just read a couple of sentences. Instead of reacting emotionally, The metropolitan type reacts primarily in a rational manner, thus creating a mental predominance through the intensification of consciousness, which in turn is caused by it. Thus the reaction of the metropolitan person to those events is moved to a sphere of mental activity, which is least sensitive and which is further removed from the depths of the personality. OK, so let's use a metaphor. Let's think of food. When you're in the village, you go your own food. And then you make the food, you eat it, and that's it. You know exactly where the food comes from, you know how it's made, and you're not really curious about the food. But the wonderful thing about the city is you get exposed to all different types of cuisine, all different types of flavors, and that excites your imagination. You're much more curious about it. You wanna know where this food is made. The problem though, of course, is this is all an abstraction. You have absolutely no idea where the food comes from. You have absolutely no idea where the food is made. And quite honestly, you don't even know the food is healthy for you or not. Okay, so the city life is a higher abstraction. And of course, today we have the internet, which is even a higher abstraction. So you go from the village to the city, now to the internet. Of course, this creates a lot of problems for people. Because this transition causes psychological issues. And the three major psychological issues are enemy. And what this means is, before in the village, you know exactly what to do. But you move to the city, there are different rules. And it confuses you. For example, in the village, if someone punches you, you punch back. And then afterwards, you become friends. In the city, if someone punches you and you punch back, you both go to jail. So it's confusing for people. Alienation means that you have actually no freedom in the city. You work from nine to five, you get up at six o'clock in the morning, get up at seven o'clock, then get to work at nine o'clock. Then you get up and work at five, and get home at 10 o'clock. So everything's the same regulated life. And you lack freedom. That might cause the alienation. The last idea is disenchantment, where you feel as though you are just a machine, and you have lost human agency. So this creates lots of psychological issues. And that's why at this time, psychologists became more popular. This is Simon Freud, and he was a very ambitious medical student who became a psychologist. And he started to see patients. And these patients were often young women who are historical. His history, historical is not a word we use anymore, but back then it just meant that They couldn't control their emotions. They were prone to outbursts, crying. When they saw a man, when they were touched by a man, they screamed, they cried. They couldn't form healthy relationships. So Freud was tasked with figuring out why this was happening and trying to help this woman. And he spent a lot of time with this woman. And he did something pretty novel at the time, which is he basically, he just won their trust and asked them directly, why are you like this? And the woman after many sessions, after becoming friends with Freud, they start to confide in Freud and they told him the truth, which is, I'm hysterical, I'm afraid of men touching me because when I was young, my father abused me. And Freud at first was shocked, I think everyone would be shocked. But over time, he would hear this story from so many different patients with the same symptoms that he concluded that they must be telling him the truth. And he wrote a very famous paper in 1896 called The Ideology of Hysteria. Ideology means origins, okay? And in it he says, my previously communicated assumption that trauma, specifically sexual trauma, cannot be stressed enough as a pathodontic agent was confirmed anew. even children of respected, high-minded, perennical families fall victim to real rape much more frequently than one had dared to suspect. Either the parents themselves take substitution for their lack of satisfaction in this pathological manner, or else trusted persons, such as relatives, abuse, the ignorance and innocence of children. Okay, so he's arguing that abuse is much more common we are led to believe. Even those that we think are pillars of society engage in the sort of abuse. So what he's doing is that he's becoming an advocate for this woman. He's telling the world, they're not crazy, they're not being historical. They were traumatized, and that's why they're behaving like this. If you got hit by a car, your leg wouldn't, you wouldn't be able to walk. Well these women are the same way. They were traumatized physically when they were young and that's why they are became like this. That's why they have problems forming these emotional bonds of others. The symptoms of hysteria are determined by certain experiences of the patients which have operated in a traumatic fashion and which are being reproduced in a psychological life in the form of pneumatic symbols. So what he's saying is this is not made up in the mind. This happened physically and then it gets represented in the mind. So that's Freud arguing for his patients. Now let me introduce you to a man named Jeffrey Masson. And he wrote a book called The Assault on Truth. His story is this. He went to Harvard and he became very interested in psychoanalysis. And he began to study it. And he became friends with Anna Freud, who is Simon Freud's daughter. Freud thought very highly of him and she trusted him with the letters of Seaman Freud. And before this was not open to the public and no one knew about these letters. But Jeffrey Mason spent years going over the letters. And what he discovered shocked him. The early Freud and the later Freud are two different people. They have two different theories about trauma and abuse. And in his book, he presents the evidence, which are Freud's letters to friends. All right, so let's just read a couple. This is early Freud. I therefore put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria, there are one or more occurrences of premature experience, occurrences which belong to the earliest years of childhood. Okay? There are a whole number of other things that vouch for reality of infantile sexual scenes. first place, there's the uniformity which exhibit in certain details. So what he's saying is, I know that people don't believe me, but the evidence is clear. I've talked to different people, they don't know each other. They're telling the same story. They're telling the same details. So either there's this giant conspiracy or they're telling the truth. It is less easy to refute the idea that the doctor forces reminiscences of this sort on the patient, that he influences him by suggesting to imagine and reproduce Nevertheless, it appears to me equally untenable. I've never yet succeeded in forcing on a patient a scene I was expecting to find in such a way that he seemed to be living through it with all the appropriate feelings. Perhaps others may be more successful in this. When you read Freud, you see him as a very clear, as a very nuanced, as a very balanced thinker. Okay? He accepts there are different possibilities. It's possible that he himself is suggesting false memories to his patients. And he says, this is possible, but I have failed to achieve this goal. And there are others who may be better at this than I, but I haven't been able to do it. So based on this evidence, he argues that these patients must be telling the truth. This is the early Freud. This is Sandor Forenzi. And for the longest time, they were colleagues. They were best friends. They were both advocates for patients. And then they had a falling out. They started to, they basically refused to talk to each other anymore. And the reason why is Sandor Forenzi continue to advocate for patient rights. Whereas, Semen Freud completely changed his attitude. So let's look at the new Freud. Since child masturbation is such a general occurrence, and is at the same time so poorly remembered, it must have an equivalent in psychic life. And in fact, it is found in the fantasy encounter in most female patients. Namely that, the father seduced her in childhood. This is the later reworking, which designed to cover up the recollection of infantile sexual activity represents an excuse and an adoration thereof. The grain of truth contained in this fantasy lies in the fact that the father by way of his innocent caresses in earliest childhood has actually awakened the little girl's sexuality. It is the same affectionate fathers that are the ones who then endeavored to break the child of the habit of masturbation. Okay, so what Freud is trying to say is, young girls from a very early age, they are sexual animals. They have these urges. And they have this longing for the father. And it's compounded by the fact that the father in his innocence hugs and caresses his little girl. It's made worse when the father notices that the girl is masturbating and tries to stop her. And this creates a sense of both resentment, hatred, and more longing. Okay? So now what Freud is saying is, it's not the father. The father did nothing. He's innocent. The girl is the one who, who because of these sexual urges has all these sexual fantasies that she is normally able to differentiate between fantasy and reality. All right? So this is from an essay, fragments of analysis of hysteria. The love hungry little girl unhappy at having to share her parents' affection with her brothers and sisters realizes that all that tenderness comes flowing back when her parents are made anxious by her illness. The girl now knows a way of calling for her parents' love. So now he's explaining why hysteria is so common in society. And the answer is very simple. Woman are desperate for attention. It's that simple. They're fine, they have no issues. They just want attention. And that's why they are hysterical, okay? Because they know that illness attracts attention from caregiving males. This is Simon Freud's book, Civilization and its Discontents. And in it, he expresses his contempt for women in society. All right, let's read it. Furthermore, women should soon come into opposition to civilization and display their retarding and restraining influence. Those very women who in the beginning laid the foundations of civilization like claims of their love. Women represent the interests of the family and of sexual life. The work of civilization has become increasingly the business of men. It confronts them with ever more difficult tasks and compels them to carry out instinctual sublimations of which women are little capable. All right, so for saying this, we must thank women because about women to be no civilization. They give birth. They raise families. But men are smarter than women. And so men are tasked with responsibility of building civilization, of creating science, of creating literature, of creating philosophy, of politics, of administration. But all we want is attention to be doled on. And that's why women hate civilization. First of all, because they're not smart and they can't really contribute to civilization, but also because it takes men away from them. Okay? So now the question then is, okay, this is like really strange because the Freud that we encountered earlier was a scientist, very clear, very nuanced, very subtle in his thinking. This Freud, he's like a myth maker. He's almost like a priest. Okay, so what explains the transition? Okay, well, there's a very simple explanation, right? The simple explanation, which is simple explanation is, he may be treating his patients who are young women, but who's paying the bills? The father, right? It's the father who's paying Freud. So if Freud went to the father and said, Oh, I talked to your daughter, it's your fault that she's like this. Well, they wouldn't be very happy. Okay? So, we can understand why at the end of the day, Freud decided that he needed to change his story if he wanted to maintain his clientele. So the question then is, okay, is there evidence to suggest that sexual trauma and abuse was common in Vienna at this time in history, the late 19th century. And the answer is yes, there is some piece of evidence, okay, not complete, okay, but there's some piece of evidence to suggest this was actually a thing in Vienna in the late 19th century. So this is, so Vienna is part of the Austrian-Hungary Empire and there are lots of secret societies and religious cults at this time, okay. One of them is called Fragism. And then, Frengism rejected Jewish norms and believed they were obligated to transgress moral boundaries. Remember, the Christ of the Faith, right? How do you demonstrate your faith in God? How do you know God loves you? How do you know you're faithful? Well, you break taboos. And they were breaking a lot of taboos. The Frengists engaged in sexually promiscuous rights, such as the infamous 1756 incident where they were allegedly caught dancing around, a half-naked woman. At its height, Fregnism claimed perhaps 50,000 followers. That's a lot. 50,000 followers is a lot. And a lot of them were powerful people. Primarily Jews living in the Polish Lutheran Commonwealth as well as Central and Eastern Europe. Later, Fregnists were encouraged to convert and en masse to Catholicism, okay? And so who are these people? Well, they are followers of a man named Sibatai Zefi. who lived in 19th century, who was a Jewish rabbi who lived in 19th century Ottoman Empire. And for many, he was extremely charismatic and he was basically their Messiah. He was the Jewish Messiah. And he preached a religion of transgression because transgression meant courage. It meant empowerment. It meant true faith. And he had a lot of followers. And that's why the sultan called him and then said, okay, I'll give you a choice. You can either continue doing what you do and I'll kill you or you convert to Islam. So you convert to Islam. But when he did so, he told his followers, I did so because God doesn't care about what you do. God cares about what's in your heart. As long as you're true to God, what you do in life does not matter. Okay, and the religion he started is still around today. Okay? And this is Wikipedia, okay? All this is Wikipedia, and you can look at it online to make sure that I'm just making this up, right? So as part of this movement, I mean, you can read this, right? All right? Sexual abuse was actually pretty common. So we have evidence suggests that, Yes, these women were probably telling the truth and Freud knew so, but Freud ultimately had to change his story in order to protect his livelihood. Okay, but there's also another reason why Freud had to change his story. And it has to do with women named Ignis Simmelweis. Ignis Simmelweis lived in 1840s Vienna. And he was a doctor who worked at Vienna General Hospital. And he was in charge of two maternity clinics, places where women give birth. Same hospital, same staff, but the mortality rate at the second clinic was much higher than the first clinic. Woman could die giving birth because of fever. So 10% of women were dying in the second clinic. And only about 3% were dying in the first clinic. So, in this case, he was appalled by this. And so he launched an investigation as to what was happening. And he spent seven months, a long, long time, trying to figure out what happened, what was happening. And he looked at all different possibilities, including weather, including treatment, including personnel, everything, okay? And then he had a radical breakthrough. He had an insight, which is this. In the second clinic, it was a teaching hospital. So doctors, when in the morning, woke up cadavers, okay? They would show students how to dissect cadavers. And then in the afternoon, they'd go and deliver babies. And, some of us, he didn't know why, because at this time, germs were not a thing. People didn't know about the existence of germs. He didn't know why, but he theorized that there could be connection. So he created a protocol. He basically had everyone wash their hands using a formula of water, chlorine, and lime. And we still use it today, exactly the same formula today. And so he tried this protocol and it was a miracle because after people start to wash their hands no one died in childbirth anymore. And symbol wise being a rigorous scientist he collected all this data to conduct a lot of experiments to prove this had to be true that washing your hands could save lives. And then we presented his findings to the staff, the doctors of Vienna General Hospital believing that they would they would praise him and then promote this all throughout Europe in order to save as many as possible. Instead the doctors told him they had to keep this quiet. They'll promote Sima Wise, they respect him and he did amazing work but if word came out that this was true then people would know that they were responsible for the deaths of these women before and their reputation would be in tatters. And then Sima Wise of course responded by, yes I understand that, but if we don't publish our findings, if we don't know about this, more women are gonna die in childbirth. And they fought for a long time, years and years, and then eventually, symbol-wise, he was blacklisted, he was not allowed to work ever in the hospital again, and then ultimately he was confined to an incident of asylum where he was killed by the guards. And he died leaving a young family. And so that's what happens to you when you defy powerful people in Vienna in the 19th century. And Freud didn't want the same fate. And he also had a young family. So this story is horrible. But if you don't believe me, you can go on Wikipedia. He was institutionalized in the same asylum by his colleagues. And in the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later. So this is a fate that will happen to you in Vienna if you defy powerful people. So now we have an explanation for why Freud made the transition, why he changed his story. But now there's another problem which is, how does Freud convince his patients to go along? Before he told his patients, I believe you, and they trusted him, and now he's changing his story. So how can you convince them that they in fact do suffer from sexual fantasies? And like this experience of sexual abuse, it's always made up in the head. And that's a very hard job to do. So the solution is the interpretation of dreams, all right? So for a pioneer new way of hypnotizing his patients, his patients, so together they would analyze their dreams. Because if you talk about their memories in their past, you're going to fight back and it says, I remember very clearly. You talk about your dreams that allows you to suggest suddenly new ideas and new memories, to basically plant new memories and basically gaslight that person. Does that make sense? So the interpretation of dreams. So that is the story of Freud. Okay. But this leaves a question is, why did this spread throughout the world? That's something that we will look at in part three. So a lot of influence of Freud has to do with Carl Jung, who will take his ideas of the unconscious and systemize it for popular consumption. So we already discussed his framework where we are all dualities. We have an ego, we also have a shadow. We have a conscious but also a unconscious, a personal as well as collective, an anonymous and an anima. You'll popularize the ideas of personality types, introvert, expert, which is what we still use today. All right. The main influence is in modernism, a transformative art movement beginning around the early 20th century. All right. So arguably the first great modern artist is James Joyce, who in 1922 published Ulysses. James Joyce was Irish. He was an Irish expatriate and he actually studied Dante in university. So he wrote Ulysses as a way to imitate almost surpassed Dante. And of course Ulysses refers to Homer's Odyssey. Now, we're gonna read a passage from Ulysses to understand the power of writing. Okay? In Edible Modality of the Visible, At least that if no more thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I'm here to read. C spawn and C rack, the nearing tide that rats the boot. Start green, blue, silver, rust, colored signs, limits of the dying fun, but he adds in bodies. Okay, what does this mean? I have no idea. All right, I have no idea. I can explain to you Dante, I can explain to you Homer and Shakespeare, But I struggle with James Joyce. And there are two reasons why. The first reason is he was a singer. So you have to read what he writes, so it's music. It's meant to be read out loud. So it's musical. And that's really the power of his writing. He's more focusing on the style rather than the substance. That's the first thing. Second thing is that he was extremely well read. And everything that he writes in every sentence, there are multiple allusions and references to other books. So you must have read what he read. You must have experienced what he experienced in order to understand him. And there are those who argue that Ulysses is the greatest book in the world. In fact, if you go online, you just Google the best book ever written in human history. James Joyce is up there. Ulysses is either number one or number two on these list of 50 best books in human history. And there are many who tell me, yeah, James Joyce is hard, but if you spend the time to go over what he's writing and connect the references, you will have a transformative intellectual experience. Okay, it's almost like doing a jigsaw puzzle. And that's all true, okay? But think about what they're saying. What they're really saying is that James Joyce believes that he is God. He has the mind of God. And if you spend the time to understand what he writes, and it might take you years, decades, you will access the mind of God. That's very different from Dante, which is trying to use poetry to bring people into the mind of God, which is the truth of the world. is a lot more accessible than James Joyce. So let's look at the differences. Modern literature, as represented by Ulysses, it is elitist, it's self-referential. It just has a lot of illusions and references. But you actually don't know what the meaning is. Like what is the bigger story here? And it's used as something called stream of consciousness writing, which is it's trying to capture the mind as it thinks and works. that's different from Homer, who was very democratic. He was trying to bring beauty and truth to the people through epic poetry. Okay? So starting with modern literature, we have this erupt change in the nature of literature before it was about empowering people to seek the truth for themselves. Now modern literature, it's really just this very elite club of very arrogant, haughty people. Okay? James Joyce was good friends with Virginia Woolf. In fact, Virginia Woolf actually published James Joyce. And I think in 27, Woolf published a book called To The Lighthouse, and it's probably her most famous work. And in it, she's also trying to respond to Joyce. To The Lighthouse, it's very much based on Homer's Odyssey. And it's a very, it's extremely well written, okay? Okay, let's look at what she writes. There were the eternal problems, suffering, death, the poor. There was always a woman dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to all these children, you shall go through with it. To eight people she had sent, relentlessly said that, and the bill for the greenhouse would be 50 pounds. Okay, so what she's doing is she's reading a book and she's thinking about the issues raised by book. She's also thinking about life. Like, I have to go and do something, okay? And that's really how our minds work. So this captures really well, stream of consciousness thinking. And she's heavily influenced by Freud, right? She's trying to go into the unconscious and trying to figure out how the unconscious works. The lighthouse is really about memory, about perception, about remembering, all right? But again, it's extremely self-indulgent and it's inward looking. And again, it's a record departure from traditional literature. So let's compare modern literature with Dostoevsky. Remember before we discuss Dasyewski. For Dasyewski, the heart is a deep, impenetrable ocean and our psychology responds to external events. We live in the world and respond to the world. We must surrender ourselves to others to seek salvation and redemption. We cannot rely on ourselves to forgive ourselves, to love ourselves. We must rely on others. We are in the community of people, okay? So these are the truths of Dasyewski. When we get to modern literature, self-discovery will allow for self-mastery. Our psychology responds to suppressed memories. We can be our own salvation and redemption. It's too optimistic. It's too positive. It's saying that, hey, if you're poor, don't worry about it. As long as you think happy thoughts, you'll be good. This idea of positive psychology that we have today. Paul Young and Fritz Simering Ford also had a major influence on Pablo Picasso. And you can see it from his painting, Head of a Woman, okay? Now what you will notice is it's a cubist portrait of a woman, but if you look further, it's actually two people as well, okay? And so what this is doing is it's visually representing the theory of the self as presented by Jung, okay? So do you see the similarities? Great. Okay. So why is this art spreading throughout the world? Well, I mean, not to be conspiracy theorists, but let's look at an article, right? Was modern art really a CIA style? All right, so this article is from JSTOR, which is a academic journal, very mainstream. And let's read what it writes. In the mid-20th century, modern art and design represented the liberalism, individualism, dynamic activity, and creative risk possible in a free society. Okay? So in other words, right now, the capitalist west is at war with communism. 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, communism is spreading all around the world. It's very popular among people. It calls for collective action. So the capitalist west, the powers that be, They're spreading Freud, they're spreading Joyce, they're spreading Wolf, they're spreading Palocasso, they're spreading all this art, this mariner's art in order to create a coldest self. Because if you believe in the coldest of the self, if you believe that you are the source of everything, then you're not capable of collective action. So in many ways, this is a response to a problem posed by communism. And this will be obviously most obvious during the Cold War. Does that make sense? All right, so why would that be bad? Why would the call of the self be bad? Well, this is Macau Buchanan and he explains it very well in his writings, okay? So let's read really quickly what he wrote. Having human in man and freedom above all is a product of a social collective labor. To be free and absolute isolation is absurdity invented by theologians and beneficent who have replaced the society of humans by that of God, their phantom. To say that each person feels free in the presence of God, that is, the presence of absolute emptiness, nothingness. Freedom in isolation, then, is the freedom of nothingness, or indeed, the nothingness of freedom, slavery. God, the figment of God, has been historically the moral source, or rather, the moral source of all slavery. So what he's saying is, the radical turning point in human history is the invention of Christianity, because it gives us the idea of individualism. And we think that's a good thing because we're taught that individuality, individualism means free choice, it means freedom. But what he's saying is, that's an absurdity. We only have freedom from our community. We only have freedom if others are free around us. If we are free, but no one else is free, then we are slaves as well. So because individuality prevents us from working with others, from loving others, then that makes us slaves to ourselves. And that allows for the power of society to better control us. And so what he's saying is, Christiane, it's a slave religion. It was designed to make us all into slaves. And this world. And Prykhanin lived in the 19th century. But if he read Freud, then he would also argue that the cult of psychoanalysis, it's really about entraping yourself in your own emotions. As for us, we want neither phantoms nor nothingness, but living human reality. And we recognize that man can feel free, be free, and therefore can achieve freedom. In order to be free, I need to see myself surrounded by man, by free men, and be recognized as such by them. I am free only when my individuality reflected in the mirror of the equally free consciousness of every individual around me comes back to me straight from everyone's recognition. So what he's saying is this, if you want to be happy, if you want to be free, care about others, be kind to others, work with other people, sacrifice your own self-interest for the self-interest for the greater good. That is what will make you really happy. And that's generally true because think about this, okay? If you're by yourself, will you be happy? Probably not, but if you have a family, you have kids, you don't have any freedom, but you're a happier person. In many ways, you're a more free person because you have better control of your emotions. You have more purpose in life. All right, so let's bring this to the present day, social media. What social media is, it is the democratization of the cold of itself. Or only the wealthy could enjoy the coldness of itself. Only the wealthy could take the time to self-indulge. But now with social media, everyone can participate in the coldness of itself. And that has led to a global epidemic of depression. So look at year 2015. You see this huge spike in depressive symptoms. because 2015 is the year when we had access to smartphones. So now young people feel they can't do anything right. Life is not useful and I do not enjoy life. This huge spike, which has led to a huge spike in suicide. And this is happening throughout the world, not only in North America and Europe, but also in Latin America and East Asia as well. So the color of the cell, which originated in Europe, has now conquered the world through technology. So that's it. So the answer to the three questions. The first question is, would it for get his idea? Second question, why did Freud break up Yuhn? The third question, why is Freud's idea so popular today? Well, it's all to serve the interests of the powerful. And that's the world we live in today. And the only solution we're going forward is if we rediscover our humanity, if we are able to find the courage to care about others and put the interest of others before our own interests, we ourselves must choose to kill the cult of the self. Okay, all right. So next class we will do nationalism, all right? Bye."}
{"video_id": "e92jyBMmAyM", "title": "Civilization #19:  Gilgamesh and Mesopotamia's Quest for Immortality", "published": null, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e92jyBMmAyM", "lang": "en", "duration_s": 3230.471, "model": "small", "device": "cpu", "compute_type": "int8", "tokens_hint": 5967, "text": "Okay, good morning. We are doing Mesopotamia today. This is the Bronze Age. We did Egypt last class. We are doing Mesopotamia today. In the next class, we will finish with the Indus Valley. So before I begin, I want to make three general points about the study of history and how civilizations develop. The first point is this. Every culture has a mythology. And mythology is the collective worldview of the people that lets them understand the reality around them. So another idea that we can say is mythology is a shared reality. And every civilization has mythology. So for example, today our mythology would be science and history, right? We think there are true and objective, but they're actually mythologies. They're a shared reality. And every civilization would have its own mythology. And that's what makes the culture unique. So that's the first point. So what we will do today to better understand Mesopotamia is to compare, contrast its mythology with that of the Egyptians. Second point is there's an idea called the dialectic. And this was an idea proposed by the German philosopher named Frederick Hegel in the 19th century. He believes that history is driven by opposing ideas. So whenever you have one mythology or one idea, there always must arise another opposing idea that challenges it. And that's what drives history. And history is always moving toward a synthesis of ideas. So the example would be there's capitalism and the opposing idea would be communism. The synthesis of the idea would be socialism. And what's really important to understand is that ideas can be living things that change over time. The third idea I want to introduce is the idea of diversity and differentiation. And the idea here is we humans have some fundamental natures about us. So for example, we're all religious in some aspect. Another fundamental instinct about us, we strive to be different. And that's why diversity is the iron law of society. Okay, so the example is in a family, all the siblings will be different. In a classroom, the students will be different. And you could be a certain way in a classroom, and And then you go to another classroom and you figure out the students there are similar to you so you will change as a person to differentiate yourself from other people. So that's also another principle of history. Societies strive to be different from each other. They strive for diversity and differentiation. We cannot make generalizations about societies. The only thing that we can say is, societies or cultures fall into a spectrum. Okay? And they're usually defined by the elite, or generalizations, okay? So this is another way of saying, today I'm gonna make very broad generalizations about these societies and civilizations. And they're useful for our purposes, But I want you to be aware that these are simplifications, these are generalizations. OK? All right. So let's start. OK. So Mesopotamia is a very different culture and civilization than Egypt because of its geography. OK? So if you look at the geography of Egypt, it has natural boundaries. So for example, to the west is a Sahara desert. To the north is the Mediterranean Sea. To the east is the Red Sea. And then to the south are the cataracts. So it makes it hard to travel up the Nile from the south. So there are really only two access points into Egypt, which can be easily defended, the south, and also from the Lavate, okay, which is basically Israel, Syria, Jordan. And because of its natural boundaries, Egypt doesn't really feel threatened by external enemies, also it has the Nile River, which is the foundation of its civilization. Remember last class we talked about how the Nile was very generous. It flooded predictably every season, and so it made agriculture very productive in Egypt, which allowed them to sustain a very large population, which then can be used to create monuments like a pyramid, okay? So for most of its history, Egypt were stable and prosperous. Mesopotamia is completely different. So first of all, Mesopotamia, which is in what we call Iraq today, it has no natural boundaries. Mesopotamia is Greek for the land between two rivers. These two rivers are the Euphrates and the Tigris. Euphrates and the Tigris. to the west of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the West of the home to certain empires, like the Hikites, who will always threaten Mesopotamia, okay? So Anatolia is a threat to Mesopotamia. The people of Arabia and the Zacchaeus Mountains are nomads. And as we know, nomads are a very aggressive people. And so they will constantly launch raids against Mesopotamia, which threatens its safety. Okay, so Mesopotamia throughout its history has always been at war with its neighbors. The other thing about Mesopotamia is even though it's fertile, it's something called a fertile crescent, which extends from Mesopotamia into the Levant. It's called a fertile crescent. The Euphrates and the Tigris don't really cooperate. They're very chaotic. They change course all the time. And so the only way to tame the Euphrates and the Tigris is through irrigation. Because if you farm too close to the bed, the riverbank, you're going to get flooded. So they have to develop irrigation in order to tame the Euphrates and the Tigris. So the geography of these two cultures are very different. And therefore, the history is very different. For most of its history, Egypt was unified as an empire. It was very stable. But Mesopotamia was always in flux. So the first great civilization of the Mesopotamia were the Sumerians. They were eventually conquered by the Acadians. And then you had the Assyrians and the Babylonians. And these four civilizations are what we call Mesopotamia. Any questions so far before I go into the brief history of Mesopotamia? OK, yeah, that's a good question. But what is the relationship between these four relationships, the Samarians, the Acadians, the Babylonians, and the Assyrians? OK, so the very first civilization were the Samarians. And then they were eventually united by the Acadians. So Samaria was not really an empire. It was a culture and a civilization that was divided into city states, like the Greeks, before the conquest of the Macedonians. And the Acadians under Sargon of Akkad, or Sargon of the Great, united the city-states and gave us the idea of Sumerian civilization. After the Canadian Empire fell, North Mesopotamia became the Assyrian Empire, South Mesopotamia became the Babylonian Empire. They all saw themselves as heirs to the Sumerian civilization. So even though they're different civilizations, they share a common mythology, which I will discuss later in the class. Does that make sense? OK. So I'm going to talk very briefly about how Mesopotamian developed. So remember that in the beginning, agriculture first appeared in two places, Anatolia and the Lava. Then there was something called the 8.2 kilo year event. And we can see this as dramatic climate change that radically changed the geography and the climate of this world. And because of the cooling and temperature, the people in the Levant and the people in Anatolia were forced to spread out. So they went to Europe, they went to Egypt, they went to Mesopotamia. And when they did that, they spread agriculture. And remember, the agriculture, the mythology, is the mother goddess, which meant that they were mainly peaceful, egalitarian people, who were very artistic. So this is a very peaceful, stable world. But then you have the 5.9-kilow year event. So this is about 6,000 years ago, 4,000 BCE. And again, you saw a radical change in temperature, which again forced migration and force these civilizations to change. One of the major changes in Miss Optania is the founding of a place called Oric. And Oric is interesting, sorry, it's here. Oric is interesting because it is considered the first city of the world. And so this is the beginning of what we call civilization. the modern idea of civilization. And it has about 40,000 people. And this is what we considered the beginning of the Sumerian civilization. And the Sumerian civilization is considered the cradle of civilization. It is the beginning of the foundations of modern civilization. They gave us irrigation technology. They gave us mathematics. They gave us astronomy. They gave us writing, okay, Cuneiform writing. They gave us the legal system, okay? They gave us hierarchy and religion. So there was an explosion of innovation with the founding of URIC. Now, URIC eventually would become a huge city which compelled the people to migrate and found cities that are similar to URIC, okay? They're basically colonies, And they're scattered throughout Mesopotamia. These are city states that at first were part of the Urk civilization, but eventually they became prosperous and wealthy themselves. And so they broke away from Europe. And this led to tension and conflict, and maybe sometimes even outright warfare. But please remember, during this time, The idea of massive warfare that we would see during the Greek and Roman periods, it's still pretty absent. There's conflict, it's short term. And they have conflicts in order to resolve territorial disputes or trade disputes, but they're not trying to wipe each other out. One of the great mysteries is where the Samaritans come from. We have this problem because when we discovered Kunea form and we translated the Sumerian language, we discovered the spoken language is very different from the surrounding regions, whose spokes are going to call a Semitic language. So the language spoken in the area are part of the Semitic language group. But Sumerian is not part of that group. There's not enough similarities. So there is no other language like Samaritan in the world. It's what is called a language isolate. It is unique. And so this has puzzled scholars for decades. And quite honestly, no one knows why this is the case. No one knows. There are different theories. One theory is the Samaritan people are people who came from Anatolia and settled in the Euphrates because it was good for agriculture. Okay? So that's one theory. But there are other theories. There are other people who believe the Samaritans came from the Zagros Mountains. Okay? There are other people who believe they came from Arabia and settled. And then there's another group of people who believe the Samaritans are people who came from the Indus Valley. We'll talk about the Indus Valley next class. But all you need to know is, in this valley, it is a very advanced civilization. It's very large, 5 million people. And it covers three major areas, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northwest India. It is larger than Egypt and Mesopotamia combined. So people believe that the Innis Valley sent a colony to Mesopotamia, which found it Eurik. And it makes sense because it's actually pretty easy to get from Innis Valley to Eurik because of the Arabian Sea. So these are the different theories. But then there's another theory, which I think makes the most sense, which is this. Sumerian is a Creole language. It was invented by a melting pot of cultures and languages. And it's very similar to the menu we speak today, right? Where menu didn't exist, but because you had so many different cultures coming to the palace, they had to create their own language in order to communicate with each other. And we call that language today manduid. Does that make sense? OK. So why do I think this idea makes the most sense? And again, just to be absolutely clear, no one knows. And we'll probably never know the answer. But I believe that Sumerian is a Creole language. This theory makes the most sense because of this. Why was Yorick able to develop into the first city? What makes it special? The answer is this. It is at the center of the world. Okay? So let me explain. From Uric, you're able to access the Indus Valley. You're able to access the Arabian Desert. You're able to go north to Anatolia and the Zagras Mountains, okay? And these civilizations we know traded with each other because it's the Bronze Age, right? Because to make bronze, you need to create an alloy between tin and copper. But also what's important to understand is we humans have been training with each other since the beginning because we like to explore and we like to experience different cultures. So that's what explains why Uric was able to prosper so fast because it's a center of the world. To get anywhere, you have to go for Uric. But if that's the case, if it's a trading center of the world, it makes sense for it to be also a multicultural and multilingual community of people, right? Because these traders, Moravia, Anatolia, the Zagros Mountains, also let's not forget of the Yemeni, okay, who are up here in the steps. They also trade with these people. People from the Innis Valley, it makes sense for them to come together in a straining community and develop their own language and their own culture, which eventually spreads. Also, because this is a nothing pot, it's really an immigrant culture, they're able to bring the most advanced ideas from all around the world and combine them together which creates new inventions like writing, like legal system, like mathematics, like astronomy. And that's why Sumerian became the Criticization, Because of the meeting place of the world's cultures and ideas. And because of the very instability of the environment, meaning that the Tamas, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and because they were always threatened by outside enemies, they had to develop a new culture, a new mythology based on struggle. The Egyptians can afford to be passive and fatalistic. Let the gods decide. But because this is an immigrant community, they have to focus on struggle and achievement, which is very much like America today. Does that make sense? Again, this is my theory of the Samaritan people, where they came from and why they are who they are. Any questions so far? Before I continue. So next what I want to do is I want to compare Egyptian mythology with Mesopotamian mythology to show how the geographic and cultural difference translates into the mythology, the shared reality of the people. So let's look at Egypt first. So again, Egypt, it's a very ancient civilization. And their mythology is extremely complex. They have different versions of the same stories. But I'm going to give you the generalization, which we're useful for our purposes. So let's look at Egypt. And then we'll look at Mesopotamia. Egypt. Egypt believed the first god was Ra. There are other gods who believed the first god like Atum and Amon. but let's just say the first God is Ra, who is a sun God. He comes to our world and he creates life. He basically gives life to everything, including humans. And as such, we worship him. But eventually we start to become misguided and we start to worship another God, a false God. Ra becomes angry and kills many of us. But after he kills many of us, He has tremendous regret and he decides his time is up. He should give his throne to someone else. This other god becomes Osiris. Osiris is a great god because he gives people civilization, which includes cities, which includes the pyramids, which includes writing. So it's Osiris who gives us civilization. Now he has a brother named Set. and said it's very jealous of the fact that Osiris is worshiped by the people. So he plots to usurp the throne from Osiris. So what he does is this. He builds a sarcophagus, a tomb, okay? He presents to Osiris and says, Osiris, my great king, this sarcophagus is the most beautiful and comfortable sarcophagus in the world. He will love lying in here. And Osiris is like, oh, that's interesting. Let me try. So Osiris gets into the sarcasm and set, closes it forever. Then he kills Osiris and dismembers his body. Osiris has a wife, Isis. And when he hears about the death of her husband, she looks for his body and assembles it together. But you can't find the head. And then Osiris becomes the God of the underworld. After Osiris is reassembled, he impregnates Isis. They have a son named Horace. Horace eventually grows up, and he's angered by the fact that his uncle, Set, has usurped his throne. So the two are going to battle. And the gods, who judge all, tell them They have to challenge each other to a duel. So they have a series of duels. One duel is they both turn into hippopotamists, and they try to stay in the river for the longest time possible. Horace sees us as an opportunity to kill Set. He tells his mother, Isis, while Set is distracted, while he's a hippopotamus, take a spear and kill him. And Isis agrees. But when she tries to kill Seth, she is paralyzed with fear and she fails. Horace and anger strikes beheads her mother. He doesn't kill her, but she loses her head. That's how angry he is. So Isis and Horace continue their challenge, eventually set the sights to poison Horace. But before he can do so, Horus first poisons him. Then the Horus becomes king, and he gives Egypt the institution of kingship. So every pharaoh is a direct descendant of Horus, or another reincarnation of Horus. That is the Egyptian myth of creation. Now, the Mesopotamians, they have different myth of creation called the Enuma Elish from up high. Okay? The Enuma Elish. And this is the story of the Enuma Elish. There are two gods. The first god is Tiamat, who is basically salt water. Okay? Then you have Absol, who is freshwater. The two great gods get together and they give birth to other gods, okay, their children. These gods then give birth to other gods, okay. Eventually Absol gets annoyed with his children because children are loud and he can't sleep. So he resolves to kill all his children and bring peace to the world. Tiamat finds out about Abzu's sabbatical plan. He warns she warns her children. The gods get together and they kill Abzu. Tiamat is enraged by the death of her consort and she resolves to raise a great army and destroy her children. The gods get together and they elect Mardak, who is the son of the gods. So he's basically a third generation god. They elect Mardak to lead them in battle against Tiamat. So you have these two massive armies converging against each other. And then Tiamat turns into a huge water serpent and challenges Mardak to a duel. They fight, okay? Mardak unleashes whirlwinds into the mouth of Tiamat and that's sort of like dizzies her and then Mardak strikes her down. After he kills her, she uses her body to create the world. She uses half of her body to create the sky. And she used another half of the body to create the continents. He creates the moons and he creates the stars. He creates the entire universe basically from the body of Tiamat. After that, the gods all decide to rest in peace. But they need people to take care of them. They need people to watch the land, to farm until the land. So they create humans as their slaves, humans. And that's how the enema Elish ends. Each city has its own God, and the humans in that city must revere and take care of that God, to be their slave for all of eternity. So as you can see right away, there are massive differences between Egyptian mythology and Mesopotamia mythology. The first major difference is the gods are benevolent, right? The gods give us everything. We just sit back. The gods will give us life. They will give us civilization. They will give us kingship. They will give us apperiments. So all we have to do is respect, and revere, and worship the gods. We humans don't need to participate in the order of things. But in the Nimri-Leh, we find out that gods are extremely violent and they demand our servitude. They're our masters. So we must constantly work to please the gods. That's one major difference. Second major difference is, as you can see from the addition mythology, the main virtue that wins out is cleverness, deception, trickery. And you can say this is because for the longest time, Egypt was an empire. So what mattered was not the ability to go to war, but the ability to manipulate eternal politics, what we call palace intrigue. And this is no different from China, right? Because remember, in China, we have something called shunze bingfa, the art of war by shunze. That is a manual on palace intrigue, right? How to trick other people. It's not a manual on how to go to war. But here, the value that is most prominent in Mesopotamia is bravery or strength. Not cleverness. There's no trickery going on. It's just pure power, pure bravery. And the third major difference is in Egypt, they believe the gods are helping each other. They build on top of each other's legacy. That's what progress is. That's what improvement is. But in Mesopotamia, they believe in something called creative destruction, which is to say, in order to create something new, You must destroy the old. Tiamat represents the old. Therefore, she must be destroyed. And from the old, you can build a new civilization. But you must first destroy the old. And conflict is a source of creativity. Does that make sense? And again, they have these two different mythologies because they're reflecting the shared reality of the different geographies and history. Any questions so far before I continue? Are you clear? OK, great. OK. All right, let's continue. All right. So both Egypt and both Mesopotamia, they are in a struggle to prove hematologies are the best. The reason why is, remember that this is a time when all these civilizations are trading with each other. But also what's important to understand is there's a lot of migration going on. And people have a choice. If you're not happy here, you can always move somewhere else, okay? There isn't any idea of like nation or culture or race. People have autonomy. Okay, so you need to constantly prove that your civilization is the best to trap people which provides the labor to drive your civilization. So the Egyptians created something called the pyramids, the pyramids. To show the people around them, we are favored by the gods, because it's only the gods who could inspire us to build the pyramids. So now the people of Mesopotamia have a problem because how do you compete against the pyramids? Right? I mean, at first they tried, they created things called the ziggurats, the ziggurats which are temples to house the gods. Okay? But then they did something that was completely different and which made them immortal just as the pyramids' midigitism is immortal. They created something called the Epic of Gilgamesh. And today we celebrate the Epic of Gilgamesh as the first work of world literature. So let me first explain the plot of the Epic of Gilgamesh and show you how it reflects Mesopotamian culture and values and then explain the meaning of it. Epic of Gilgamesh. So there was a king of Eric, the first city. Eric, he's the king of the first city. And he's a demigod, okay? He's huge, he's a giant, and he's very brave. The problem is, even though he's built this great city, Eric, high walls, prosperous land, advanced civilization, he gets bored very quickly. He starts to bully the people around him. So he sees young men, he challenges them to a fight, and he beats them up, okay? He's a bully. He also rapes all the young women in Uruk, and this drives their parents to pray to the gods for relief. So the gods decide to create an equal to Garmash, and his name is Ekadu, Ekadu. Ekadu is made of clay. The two fight, and even though Gilomash defeats Enkadoo in battle, Gilomash is happy because he thinks he's found a good friend, someone who is equal, who he can share adventures with. So the two become great friends, the best of friends, and they go on these adventures together. And these adventures are tremendous challenges. For example, they challenge gods to battle. And at first they're afraid, but through their friendship and through their bravery, they're able to triumph in the end. There's a god named Ishtar, and she falls in love with Gilgamesh because he's so heroic. But Gilgamesh rebuffs Ishtar because Gilgamesh basically knows that Ishtar wants to turn him into her sex slave. He doesn't want that. He wants his freedom. He wants to prove he's a great hero. Ishtar feels rejected, feels ashamed, so she sends something called the Bold Heaven to destroy Urk. Gilgamesh and Ekadu fight the Bold Heaven and they kill this great bull. The gods now are really pissed off at Gilgamesh and Ekadu and they decide that Ekadu must die. So they inflict a disease on Ekadu which kills him. At this point, Gilgamesh is heartbroken. He's lost his best friend, and at the same time, he knows death is waiting for him. He has all these accomplishments. He's a great king. He's built this great city, but eventually he must die, and he does not want to die. He fears death. So he hears about this immortal man, this man who has lived forever, and who will live forever, and he decides to seek him out. On his journey, he has to overcome many hurdles. And along the journey, everyone implores him. Googlemash, give up this vain project. Immortality is for the gods. We are humans. We must die. That's what makes us different from the gods. Enjoy your life. Drink. Be merry. But Googlemash refuses to turn back. and he insists on continuing on his journey. Eventually he finds this immortal man who explains to him he was made immortal because he survived the great flood. The gods created humans, but the humans became too loud for the gods. So the gods resolved to kill them. But this man, this one man was favored by one god, so he was told about this plot And he built a boat and put a lot of animals in the boat in order to escape. And this is the basis of the story of the Noah's flood in the Bible. After the flood, we see that this man came down and built an altar to worship the gods. The gods felt regret for what they did. So the coppins said they promised never to do this again, to never destroy humanity again. And also they grant this man immortality. So but this is just a one off. The gods will never do this again. And so the man tells Gilomash, the search for immortality is pointless. Just go home. But Gilomash refuses to give up. So the man challenges Gilomash to not sleep for seven nights and six days. Sorry, six days and seven. six nights and seven days. He'll go on as tries, but he can't do it. So it's all futile. And then he goes home. But the moment he goes home, he has an epiphany. He sees the great walls of Eric. He sees the people happy in Eric. And he realizes this is what immortality is. Immortality is not living forever. Immortality is to be remembered by the people who love you. So the irony of all this is he goes on this search for immortality fails. But because he goes on this search, because he goes on this quest, he becomes immortal because his story, his struggle is remembered and celebrated by the people in the Epic of Gilgamesh. So this is a reflection of the values of Mesopotamia. The point is in the achievement. The point is not in the victory. The point is in the exploration. The point is in the struggle. And that's why the Mesopotamians were so innovative. And that's also why they went to war with each other all the time. And this is the beginning of the idea of literature, where memories can be shaped in such a way that it becomes so beautiful, that it becomes implanted in the minds of others for centuries, which will inspire them to greater heights of achievement. So now we have the beginning of literature and that is the legacy of Mesopotamia, the legacy of the Egyptians were pyramids, a testament to the tremendous creativity of humans of Egypt, okay, of the humans in Egypt. But the Epic of Gilgamesh is also a testament to the tremendous creativity of naturalization. And if you think about it, the Epic of Gilgamesh was written because it is in a dialectic with the pyramids, right? The Epic of Gilgamesh is also saying to the pyramids, immortality, it is an illusion. Eventually these pyramids will collapse. For the Pharaoh to seek immortality is an illusion. What matters is for the feral to look after the well-being of his people here and now. Because that's why he will be loved and remembered for eternity. He will die if his people die. But if your people live on, because of your contributions, then you'll remember forever. You'll become immortal. And that's the story of Gilmash. Any questions? Is this all pretty clear? OK. All right. So I will make a final point about these stories. Within these stories, we can see the evolution of societies over time. So let's go back to the story of the Enuma Elish. So remember, Tiamat, an apt to create the world, That's the first story. Then the gods are created, OK? And they inhabit the world. That's the second story. And then Tiamat and Mardut go to war. And then from the victory of this war, Marduk creates the universe. So basically, we're seeing three different mythologies within this mythology, which gives us the idea of social change and evolution in Mesopotamia at this time. So the first story is Tiamat. Who is Tiamat? She's the mother goddess. She's the one who gives life. So this shows Mesopotamia as an agricultural society. Then you have the emergence of the gods, which the urban people would celebrate. And then finally you have the battle between Tiamat and Mardak. And this shows the battle between the old society with the new society, the urban and the agricultural. The agricultural, it is egalitarian. It is peaceful. The urban is patriarchal. So how do you explain or how do to justify the transition from an equal society to a patriarchy. The answer is this. The answer is embedded in the mythology, right? Tiamat represents chaos. Marduk represents order. So even though we are letting go of the old, we're just showing the old, it's to create a more peaceful and orderly world, okay? So remember, Tiamat is the water serpent. And for the longest time, we believe the water serpent represents life and divinity. Why? Because if you think about it, the serpent, the water serpent looks like the river. And the river is the basis of oscillation, right? So, and this is true for most oscillations. In China, what do we call the water serpent? What do we call the water serpent in China? Long, right? The problem is the river floods. And if you flood too much, you destroy civilization. So it's chaotic. And that's why it's important to have a patriarchy or an urban elite. Because they can help us, command us, to create irrigation, to build walls, which will tame the river and the water serpent. Does that make sense? So within this mythology, we are seeing the evolution of society from an egalitarian one to a patriarchy. Also, we are in the Guglumash, we are witnessing the transition from a society based on a great king to one that is more organized around a bureaucracy. Right? Right? Because remember, the story starts with the king going on all these adventures. Okay? The story ends with the king coming back and recognizing what matters is the well-being of his people. And for that, you need a bureaucracy to manage everyday affairs. And so this represents, you can interpret this as representing the beginning of a barocidic elite, which will help the king order the world in a way that brings more stability and prosperity to the people. But first, the king must recognize his own hubris. He must become humble. So the great fear of the Mesopotamians is their king will become like the pharaoh who will channel all resources to build this monument, which will create inequality, corruption, and waste in society, which will lead to massive suffering during times of drought. Okay, any questions? Yeah, so Mesopotamia, the irrigation was very advanced because the Tigris and Euphrates were very Incorporative, okay? They would change course all the time. So they'd have to do a very advanced irrigation systems that would change over time. The thing about Samaria is, because it's trading, and because there are different city states, this is, it becomes a hotbed of innovation. Because if one city state creates a really good irrigation system, another city state can just crop it really easily. Okay? Does that make sense? Any more questions? OK, so next class, we'll discuss the Indus Valley civilization. And the Indus Valley civilization, if we just use the analysis we did today, we're basically geography is destiny. You would think the Indus Valley civilization is very much like the Egyptian civilization, where you have a monarchy, you have centralized authority, where they build these great monuments. The irony is, when you look at the Innis Valley civilization, and it's a huge, huge civilization, they have very advanced technology. They have these big cities that are very well designed. They have plumbing, they have sanitation. They even have air conditioning. They have these towers that trap hot air. People live for a very long time. I think over half of the population will live past 55, which is incredible, which is an incredible achievement. But what is starling about the civilization, the inner civilization is, it's peaceful, and it's egalitarian. So it's a complete mystery as to why they're so different from Egypt and Mesopotamia. Because again, Egypt, it's a centralized empire. Mesopotamia is always at war. So next class, we will look at the inner study in this value civilization and try to resolve the paradox as to why it is advanced, prosperous, but at the same time peaceful and egalitarian."}

We are discussing the American Revolution today So to review what we've done so far after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 there are now four major Civilizations are competing against each other for world domination Last class we did the British Today we'll do the Americans next week. We'll do the Russians and the Germans. Okay, so the Americans. When you think of America there's a very famous quote from Oscar Wilde who is a English playwright, novelist, humorous and he said America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence, vassalization in between. Okay, so he meant this as a joke. So what did he mean by this? This is a question we will discuss today. And what I will show you is that America in many ways, it was designed as the anti-sevalization. The founding fathers of America recognized the failings and problems of civilization and design a new form of government based on enlightenment principles in order to redeem humanity from the prejudices, the atrocities of civilization. So that's the argument we will look at today. So the history of the Americas begins when the Europeans led by the Spaniards start to interact with the new world. So the Spanish starting in 1492, they will come and conquer the Aztecs, the Mayans, and the Incas. And they will establish basically plantation economies where the Spanish are extracting resources, primarily gold, silver, from the Americas. They will also establish sugar plantations on the islands of the Caribbean. and they met it with slaves from Africa as well as other places. And this is extremely profitable for the Spanish. So of course, the English, the French, and the Dutch Republic, they want to get in on the action. And at first, they start to smuggle resources into the new world, and they engage in piracy. In 1588, the English Navy defeats the Spanish Armada. And this opens up the new world now for the Europeans to come and colonize it. The problem though is that the Spanish control the best parts of the new world. And so everyone else is stuck with North America. And in North America, there's quite a few problems. First of all, the weather's very cold. So it's not hospitable to colonization. Second problem is that you have lots of Native Americans in North America who are extremely violent. They are used to freedom and they will fight to the death. At this time in history, the tallest, strongest people in the world are actually the Native Americans in North America. Also you have lots of diseases that are problematic for the Europeans. So the Europeans spent a lot of time, basically decades, in trying to figure out how to best colonize North America. So there are three major nations that are trying to colonize North America. You have the French and what they will do is they will establish the fur trade in Canada in the Midwestern United States. They were basically trade with the natives to bring fur back to Europe. And this is a great deal for both the natives and the French. The Dutch come in, they will establish colonies, call New Amsterdam. This is today New York City. I should say the Dutch try to establish colonies as well. The people who are most successful at establishing colonies are the British. And a lot of it is because it is a very grassroots, very bottom-up movement. So the first major colony for the British is Jamestown, named after James I of Britain. And this is not a very successful colony at first, but they persist. The most successful colony is actually Boston. What makes Boston unique at this stage in North American history is that it is established by a company, the Massachusetts Bay Company, that has a charter from the English Crown. Also, they bring families into this area. So before it was basically men who came over. Now it's families who come over. And then third of all, the people who come over are Puritans. Puritans, as we discussed previously, they believe in the importance of literacy. Everyone has responsibility to read the Bible in order to interpret the command of God properly. And so Boston, from the very beginning, it's a literal society. It has schools, it has newspapers. It is very political, and it grows very, very fast. Also, if you look at Boston, it is perfectly situated between North America and England. And as England is industrializing, it requires raw resources, mainly agricultural products from this area. So Boston grows rapidly because of all these factors. So in the year 1682, you can see that the eastern United States has been colonized by the British. The French are still in Canada, and they're going to move down to the Midwest United States. The Spanish are in the southern United States. This is Florida, they found a colony called St. Augustine. They will also in California start to build colonies as well. But as you can see, the most of the economic activity in North America is based on the eastern seaboard. Now, what's really important for us to remember is the diversity of these colonies. First of all, you have differences in the economy. The northern part will focus mostly on mercantile trade. The southern part will focus mostly on agriculture. To support the agriculture, they will import slaves from Africa in order to provide the labor for Charlestown and other places. Also, the motivations of the individuals are different. So some come for economic reasons, but a lot come for religious purposes. So for example, there's a man named William Penn. And he's a Quaker. he believes in creating a peaceful civilization. So he has a charter from the king and he found a new colony called Pennsylvania named after him that believes in religious and national tolerance. So a lot of Germans come over and settle down in Pennsylvania. The capital is Philadelphia and they are Quakers. So they believe they must not fight against others. And this experiment persists for decades. It's a pretty successful experiment, but over time, they come into conflict with the natives and with other civilizations, with other colonies, and as such, they start to take up arms. Okay? There's another colony called Baltimore. It was founded actually as a Catholic haven. Okay, so England at this point, it is mainly Protestant or Puritan or Anglican, and then Lord Baltimore decides to, in Maryland, found a new colony that preaches religious tolerance, especially for Catholics. So what's really important for us to remember is that even at this early stage in American history, there's tremendous diversity, openness, and religious tolerance in America. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so by the year 1750, there are about a million British on the Eastern seaboard. That's a lot of people. In comparison, the French, who occupy actually most of the territory in North America, there's only 40,000. Eventually these two groups, the British and the French, will come into conflict creating something called the French and Indian Wars. And as you can see, it's really not a fair fight. You've got a million British versus 40,000 French. The Indians will get involved as well because what's happening is these colonies are are practicing a rapid form of colonization and expansion. What they do is they bring in immigrants. Then as the population explodes, these immigrants will be forced to move out west to settle territory in the Western frontier of these colonies. But as you know, these areas are inhabited by Native Americans. And so this brings the Indians into conflict with the British as well. So the resolution to this is that King George III will proclaim that the American colonists are not allowed to move westwards of the Appalachian Mountains. So he's restricting the growth of the American colonies in order to maintain friendship with the natives. And obviously the Americans don't like that. So in 1774, there are three major issues that bring the American colonists into conflict with the English crown. The first is, as I just mentioned, the English crown is limiting the expansion of the colonies, westwards. And they don't like that. Second is that it was very expensive for the British to protect the colonies against the French and the Indians. In fact at this stage in history it is the British people, not the American people, that are paying for the defense of these colonies. In fact the British people pay 50 times more in taxes than the Americans. And obviously the British people don't actually think this is a fair deal. So the British crown tries in many instances to impose a tax in order to get the Americans to pay for the defense of their territory. And the Americans don't like that. For the longest time, because of the English Civil War and other factors, the English crown could not actually interfere in North American affairs, and so they were used to a high level of autonomy. And the third major problem between the colonists and the British is in trade. So at this stage in history, all these nations, Spain, France, Britain, they're practicing a economic policy called mercantilism. Mercantilism is the idea that all trade should be directed by the state for the purpose of generating wealth for the state. And so what this means is that there are different trade zones that are established in competition with each other. And so if you are a British subject, you're only allowed to trade with other British lands. So the Americans can trade with England and with India, but they're not allowed to trade with the French and the Dutch and the Spanish. And the Americans don't really like this either. So these are the three main factors driving division between the American colonists and the British crowd. And this will of course culminate in the American Revolution, the War of Independence of 1776. Also, what's really important for us to remember at this time is that per capita, the Americans are far wealthier than the British. Okay? Now, this is strange. And you ask yourself, why is it that even though England is industrializing far more rapidly than the Americans, And there are more British citizens than there are Americans. And also, Britain is an empire, whereas America is a colony. How is it that the Americans per capital are able to become wealthier than the British? And the answer has to do with the American work ethic, the American attitude towards life. And this is best expressed by a man named Benjamin Franklin, who is considered one of the founding fathers of America. He is, he had an incredible life. He was born poor, but through hard work, through tenacity, through optimism, he was able to become a merchant, a very wealthy merchant, an inventor, a philosopher, an ambassador, a politician, okay? So he is basically the role model for Americans. Towards the end of his life, he wrote his autobiography. And so we're gonna study his autobiography in order to get insight into the mentality of the average American at this stage in history. Now Benjamin Franklin, by writing his memoir, he starts a new fat America that persists to today. It's called the self-improvement or self-help fat. And these are the books that sell the most in America. So you may have heard of Halloween Friends and Influenced People by Dale Carnegie. There's also Napoleon Hill, think and grow rich. And these books are just telling you how to, as they say, how to be more successful in life. This is called the self-help movement. And the Americans really pioneered this. Before in history, no one believed that for your hard work, you can actually attain more in life. And in fact, you must go up and obtain more in life. So the Americans really start the self-help fad. All right, so let's read certain passages from the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin to gain insight into the American psychology, okay? From the bosom of poverty and obscurity, so he was born poor and was born a nobody. In which I drew my first breath and spent my earliest years, I've raised myself to a state of opulence and to some degree of celebrity in the world. This is the American dream. You can be born poor, but through hard work, you can become rich. A constant good fortune has attended me through every period of life to my present, advanced age. And my descendants may be desirous of learning what were the means of which I made use and which, thanks to the assisting hand of Providence, have proved so imminently successful. They may also, should they ever be placed in a similar situation, derive some advantages from my narrative. So not only is he gonna tell you how he'll become rich, but he will teach you how to become rich, okay? So if you just do what he does, you'll become rich as well. So this is the American optimism. This is the American dream. All right, so he continues. He's talking to a friend and his friend tells him, your writing sucks. And at this time, he should be angry, right? But instead, he recognizes that, look, there's merit in my friend's criticism, so I will improve myself. And the way he improves himself, and he writes it, I won't read it because it's too long, but what he does is this. He takes a magazine, a spectator, which is very well written, and then he summarizes the main points of the articles that he's read, then he will take the summary and he will rewrite the article from memory himself. And then he will compare and contrast his work with that of the original work, and then he will make adjustments and refinements to his own writing. Now, if you actually know how to write, and if you actually met good writers, writers don't write like this. This is not how you learn how to read and write. But again, this shows us the optimism of the American character. that food just pure hard work and tenacity and persistent. You can learn anything, even though historically we all know that writers are people genius. They're sort of born great writers. You're not going to learn how to be a man of genius just through peer imitation. But what he's telling us is that no, through imitation, you can improve yourself. That's a very American outlook. All right, now he's gonna tell us how he became rich. I began to pay by degrees the debt I had contracted. And in order to ensure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be really industrious and frugal, but also to avoid every appearance of the contrary. I was plainly dressed and never seen any place of public amusement, okay? So he's telling you how he became rich. First of all, he was honest. When he did business, he made sure that he never tricked anyone. His reputation mattered above all. Also, he dressed in a very simple way. He didn't waste any money. He came across to everyone as someone who was a good Christian, a good Calvinist, someone who enjoyed making money and someone who saved all his money in pursuit of the praise of God. And this is how you become rich in America. And you can imagine that there is merit to what he says, that if you do work hard, if you are honest, and if you save a lot of money, then it's possible for you to become rich. Okay, and this is the common mentality right now at this stage in America. Okay, he continues. I ought to have related that during the autumn of the preceding year, I united the majority of well-informed persons of my acquaintance into a club, which we call by the name of the junto, and then object of which was to improve our understandings. Okay, this is really important. What he's telling us is that after he became rich, he met other rich people, and they formed a philosophy club to debate and discuss the political issues of the day. It was like a book club, okay? They read John Locke, they read Thomas Hobbes, and they discuss these ideas. So this is a quite essential American attitude, constant self-improvement, okay? You can become the wealthiest man in the world, but you still must read books. Also, this is important because these book clubs will become the foundation of the American Revolution, right? These founding fathers will meet in these clubs and they will conspire to seek independence from Britain. And a lot of it is they believe that providence, God has tasked them with founding a new nation based on enlightenment principles. So the religion of these people is what we call diasm, okay? D-E-I-S-M. And the idea of diasm that's very different from previous religions is they believe there is a God and God created the universe, but after that God went away. And now it is the responsibility of humans to make the world perfect, okay? That's the mission from God. All right, this was the best school for politics in philosophy that then existed in the province. For our questions, which were read once a week previous to the discussion, induced us to prove, attentively, such books as were written upon the subjects proposed that we might be able to speak upon them more permanently, okay? So they know that prominence has tasked them with creating a great nation called America. And to understand how to do so, they will read all the books of integrity. They will study Rome. They will study Athens, Sparta, Carthage. They were studied as such republic. They were studied as a British constitution. Okay? And by studying these classics, they will come to a consensus on how to build a new society in the image of God. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? This is the foundation of the American Revolution. All right. So not only did America became very wealthy, very fast through the hard work, simplicity, and optimism of the people, but as you can see from this map, They basically spread out really quickly. Now this time in history, the Spanish, the British, the French are all in North America. The Russians are here as well, but over time the Americans will push everyone out and this is what they call Manifest Destiny. All right, so 1776, America declares independence from Britain and again this is after years and years of conflict over a myriad of issues. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers, he writes something called the Declaration of Independence. Why is America declaring independence from Britain? And the answer is, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are credit equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the government, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it. Okay guys, Thomas Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence, which is a founding document of the United States, he is just copying word for word basically, John Locke spoke the second treaties of government. Okay, this is what John Locke said. We are born with three fundamental rights that God has given us, and therefore no one can take away from us. The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. Government is instituted, created in order to protect our rights. If government fails to protect these rights, then we have a responsibility and a right to abolish this government and create a new one. Okay? All right, so there's the War of Independence, and the great hero of this war, of course, is George Washington. Why Americans revere, so can you open the door? Why Americans revere George Washington is that it's not how great he was during the war, because ultimately, the Americans didn't actually defeat the British. It was the French, the Spanish, who combined together to defeat the British. And eventually the British decided that, you know what? The Americans, colonists, they're too problematic, we don't really care, okay? So let's just focus on Europe. So the Americans fought a guerrilla warfare and they were very brave but without the French, the Americans could not possibly have defeated the British. So, but what made George Washington so esteemed in the hearts of the American people is after this war, He retired, okay? He just went back to his farm and enjoyed his last years in the garden. And that's where Americans worship him because he's a man who could have become king of America but instead he chose to grant Americans their freedom and independence, okay? The Ada Comp of George Washington, the genius of American Revolution is actually Alexander Hamilton. He is the founder of America. He's really the one who has the vision of where America could go, of what America could be. His name is Alexander Hamilton. And he is in conflict with Jefferson. These two individuals represent two competing strands of America after the War of Independence. For Thomas Jefferson, what's important is to maintain the enable individual rights of the individuals. He wants a democracy. And because most people are farmers at this point, he believes economic policies should be focused on agriculture. So this is a Thomas Jefferson ideals of the American Revolution. Hamilton saw the world differently. He believed in his heart, as in many people at this time, America is destined to be a empire, and therefore it needs a strong central government. And in order to become an empire, it must have industry. Okay? So, some certain points. So, the colonists are fighting the British for, because the British are trying to tax them, the British are trying to impose an army on them, and because the British are trying to limit their trade. Okay, so in order to get everyone to fight, they create something called the Articles of Confederation, which limits the power of the government to impose taxes, which limits the ability of the government to raise troops. But this is problematic because you can't actually fight a war like this, okay? So after the British leave and leave America alone, problems start to arise. Basically the main problem is you have lots and lots of soldiers who used to be farmers. They were promised pay when they joined the militia against the British, but because government has no money, they had no money. And they're also farmers and because they had to leave their farms, they fell into debt. And so Richville came and took over their farms. And this led to something called the Shades Rebellion, where farmers are now trying to overflow the government. And so the solution was to create something called the Constitution, which would grant more power to the central government, especially to collect revenue, to control trade, foreign trade, and to have a army, basically. So that was the solution that proposed by Hamilton and his friends. Jefferson argued that this would, of course, limit the rights of individuals. So he insisted on adding something called a Bill of Rights to the Constitution. Okay, you may have heard someone call the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the right to speak freely, the right to bear arms. This is from the Bill of Rights, it's actually not in the Constitution. The Constitution is a framework for how to build a strong central government, okay? Second thing I want you guys to understand is, agriculture and industry, it's a different framework. It's a different economic framework. With agriculture, you need a lot of slave labor, because obviously, you need people to mend the fields and grow the crops. And that's why if you want to have agriculture, you have to bring in actually a lot of slave labor from Africa. But if it focuses on industry, you don't want slave labor. You want free labor. You want the market to decide who does what job and how much they get paid. This is a much more efficient way to organize your economy if you are industrializing. And the reason why is when you're industrializing, you need specialized labor. You need differentiation of skills. And the market is the best mechanism for skills to be differentiated and to be rewarded. Also, think about this. If you got really sick, you need heart surgery, would you rather go to a doctor who's a slave or a doctor who's gonna charge you a million dollars. So free labor just allows for more academic activity and therefore more wealth generation in society. So these are two competing visions of where America should be headed. And of course, this is a contradiction. You can't have slave labor and free labor at the same time. The North goes, immense policy of free labor. The South maintains policy of slave labor because they were mainly an uncultural society. Obviously Jefferson is from the South, Hamilton is from New York. This conflict will eventually give rise to the American Civil War of 1861. So this conflict has always been there, but in 1789 when they introduced a constitution, they choose to ignore this conflict until 1861 when this conflict finally led to violence. Okay? So this is the root of the American Civil War. Does that make sense, guys? All right. Okay. Now let's look at the Constitution. The Constitution is meant to be the most perfect former government ever established. Okay? America is a clean slate. It's a tabula, a russi. The Americans do what can do whatever they want. So they study all the previous Republican, Democratic, monocle aristocratic systems and they decide to imitate Montesquieu, Montesquieu was a French thinker who believed in the idea of separation of powers. If you want to create a perfect government, you need to have, you need to balance different factions of society using separation of powers, okay? So the American system is you have three different branches of government, you have the president who controls the military as well as foreign policy. Then you have the Congress which controls the purse, the financing of government, and yet the Supreme Court which interprets the Constitution, which interprets the highest law of the land. And so if done properly, what will happen is these three fronts of government will balance each other out. They're meant to be tax imbalances. They're each is meant to inhibit the overextension of the other. that is the American system of government that is basically stolen from a minuscule. All right, the other check and balance is the division between federal, Washington, D.C., the state level, the individual states, and the local level. So the responsibilities of each is defined very clearly. And the idea is that they should also balance each other out. This contrast, of course, with the Chinese system where you just have one person in charge, and he has something called a polybaral underneath him. The polybaral then appoints everyone into the government, as well as the army, as well as the provincial and local governments, okay? So it's a very top-down system, whereas the American system is meant to be a balanced system. Does that make sense? All right, so the problem now is, Now that you've decided that you need a constitution, you need a federal government, how do you convince the people to go along with this? Because for the constitution to go on effect, all 13 states have to agree to the constitution by a two thirds majority, okay? So to convince people, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay read something called the Federalist Papers. The Federalist Papers are a series of pamphlets, series of newspaper articles that explain why the Constitution is necessary. Okay, so let's, so we're looking at a few passages. All of them are written by Alexander Hamilton, who is really again the genius of the Constitution, the one who is really driving the need for a strong central government in order to facilitate America's imperial ambitions. All right, as this government is composed of small republics and enjoys internal happiness of each. And with respect to its external situation, it is possessed by means of the association of all the values of large monarchies. So this idea of a mixed balance government where you are trying to take the advantage of all political systems. Within America, it will be a Republican system. And so you will enjoy within your area democracy. But at a national level, in relation to other states, it will be a monarchy, where the president represents the nation in discussions and negotiations and conflicts with the other great European nations. All right, another thing that the constitution does is if the president wants to appoint ministers, if the government, if the president wants to appoint officials, they have to be vetted and approved by the Senate. Okay, and this is new. Usually a king can appoint whoever he or she wants, But in the Constitution, the Senate must vet everyone. And the idea of this is to create accountability and transparency within government. Okay, so Hamilton explains this. To what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? I answer that the necessity of their coherence would have a powerful though in general assignment operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of ferritism in the president and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. Okay, let's just say the president wants to appoint his son to be the secretary of state, okay? The son appears before the Senate, and it is like a job interview. And the son is an idiot, he doesn't know anything, okay? So in this instance, the son has embarrassed the president. And it's the fear of being embarrassed that inhibits the president from abusing his powers. Okay, that's a theory, okay? Does that make sense? And actually over the course of American history, it's worked very, very well. The power of public opinion, it's very, very strong. But what's important first to remember is, all of this is based on the idea of convention on norms and values. As long as people buy into these conventions and norms, this is a more work. But if it's someone like Donald Trump, who does not buy into these norms and values, it may be a problem, okay? Okay, so we'll see what happens over the next few years. All right, these judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding, anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the states from each other and perhaps the military despotism of victorious demigod. Let me explain what this means. What this is saying is this, as in Hamilton, what he's saying is this, in creating the government, we're not trying to aspire to greatness. We're trying to prevent collapse. This is risk management. We're trying to avoid the risk of government. What's the risk of government? Well, you could have anarchy, where people reject the government. You have civil war, where the states go to war against each other. You're going to have a perpetual alienation of the states from each other, division within the government, and then military despotism, where time arises. So at the point of the Constitution, it's risk management. It's to prevent America from failing. All right, so at the Constitution, America now embarks on something called manifest destiny. They did manifest destiny is, it's the will of God for America to conquer and settle the entire Western hemisphere. Okay, North America, South America, it's all America because that is the will of God. So today, Trump is saying how America should annex Canada and as well as Greenland. That's part of manifest destiny. It's not new. All right? All right. This leads to 1823, something called the Monroe Doctrine. So President Monroe, before Congress, he announces that from now on, the Europeans are not allowed to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere is entirely American. So he says, Europe are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. The Western Hemisphere is henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Hey guys, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, Spain, forget the Western Hemisphere, it's our territory. You come over here and we'll be the crap out of you, okay? All right, so now America, to achieve its manifest destiny, it needs to expand, okay? And it uses multiple strategies to expand. In 1803, remember the Midwest in the United States, it's controlled by France. It basically buys all this from Napoleon. So now it's extending outwards over to here. Of course there are natives in these territories. What the Americans do of course is eradicate the natives. It's a war of genocide. All right, war between 12 is when America and Canada come into conflict. Again, because of Manifest Destiny, America sees Canada as part of its territory, but the British don't agree, and this leads to the War of 1812. It's a stalemate, okay? And after stalemate, basically the British and the Americans agree that Canada will stay a British colony. But again, because of manifest destiny, we can expect America to eventually take over Canada as well as Greenland. 1846, the Mexican-American War. So America fights a war with Mexico takes over Texas as well as California. Okay? Basically the entire western part of the United States is now incorporated into the new nation. This, in 1861 we have the Civil War. All right? And I've already explained the causes of the Civil War, right? This conflict between Thomas Jefferson and Hamilton. The two visions for where America is going will eventually lead us to the American Civil War. You may have learned that the American Civil War was about slavery. It was not about slavery. It was mainly about state rights. It was really about democracy versus empire. And the democracy, the states can do whatever they want. But in an empire, the central government is able to dictate a lot of policy. So eventually this will lead to the Civil War. And of course, the North wins the Civil War because the North is far more industrial, far more wealthier and powerful than the South. And so the Hamilton vision is now achieved. It will be expanded throughout the Western Hemisphere. There's a problem though, and the problem is this. So at this time of course Abraham Lincoln is President of the United States, and he's considered the greatest president in American history for a reason. The reason is this, the Civil War was the deadest war in American history, okay? Let's look at this. Over 600,000 people died in the American Civil War, which is about four years. Only 400,000 died in World War II, right? The problem is this, in 1861, the population of America at this time was 30 million people. World War II, the population was 130 million. So this was by far the deadliest war in American history. Brothers were killing brothers. It was a tremendous, I mean, it was such a bloody conflict. And so after this war was ended, everyone was asking, why did we do this? What's the point of this? And so there was shock, there was anger, there was frustration. So Abraham Lincoln now has to stand up and explain why this happened. Why did this war happen? All right? He needs to form a new vision of America that binds people together. that creates a new union. So he presents this new vision in something called the Gettysburg Address, which is considered the greatest speech in American history. This is 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest battles in the American Civil War. And we're gonna read all of it, okay? It's because it's a very short speech and it's very powerful. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. So the War of Independence, it was not a war to seek independence from Britain. It was a revolution in human affairs. It was about bringing liberty to the world. It was about creating a new civilization. Now we're engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. So the American Revolution, it is an experiment in the possibilities of human liberation. In the Civil War, it is meant to destroy this experiment. So we must persist in this experiment. We are meant on a great battlefield of that war, Gettysburg. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. Okay. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hollow this ground. The sacrifice of the man is what has made this land sacred. The sacrifice of these men is what makes our nation sacred. It's what saves our nation. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or to track. The world with little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. And this ends it. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion. The men are dead. There's nothing we can do to resurrect them. It is the responsibility of us to live to honor the sacrifice and to continue the mission that they died for, which is to spread liberty throughout the world, to bring liberty into human civilization. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.\" Okay? So again, with Hamilton, it's about empire. For Jefferson, it's about democracy. There's a conflict, right? What Lincoln does, which is revolution, is say, no, this is not a conflict because we are an empire of democracy. We are born in liberty. We fight for liberty and we will spread liberty. All right? So this is a new concept in American history. So now America is not confined to the West Hemisphere. It has responsibility to honor the dead, honor sacrifice by creating liberty throughout the world, to create a new chapter in human civilization. That's the purpose of this speech, to heal America by reminding them of the divine mission to spread democracy and truth throughout the world. So other civil war, America is now industrializing rapidly. 1867, it buys Alaska from Russia. 1898, America fights the Spanish and they take over the Spanish colony. So now America's become an imperial power. America now controls the Philippines, as was Cuba. Then, World War I, America goes and defeats Germany. Germany. World War II is when America becomes the global hegemon of the world. And then after Soviet Union fell, we now live in something called the Pax Americana. America has the greatest power in the world. They have complete Lincoln's vision of becoming an empire of democracy. We now live in the empire of democracy. But now the question then is, what is an empire of democracy. What is that? And so we go back to Oscar Wilde's quote, America is not a civilization. Alright? And what does he mean by that? To understand this, we have to read another book called Democracy in America by a French man named Alexei de Tocqueville. This is the most famous book ever written about America. Okay, not by Americans, but by French men who visited America for maybe eight months. In 1835, he publishes Democracy in America. And he's trying to explain why is it that American democracy works and why is it destined to eventually conquer the world. All right. Now there's a lot to bade about this book. Hopefully you'll be able to read this book in college. It is a fantastic book. It's really one of the best books ever written. It's a thousand pages, so it's possible for you to interpret the book in many different ways But what I want to show you today is I think they took Phil Actually is skeptical about American democracy. He is actually Afraid of what the spreading of American liberty will mean for the world. Okay, so the argument I will show you is America is really the first mass Democratic middle-class country. Okay, but But because of that, the people there are selfish, conformist, and unimaginative. And if there is that, as America calls the world, the world will come atomized, uniform, and mediocre. Atomized just means that we live in our own little bubble. We don't really care about larger issues than ourselves. Uniform means everyone thinks the same way, and mediocre means that, well, no one's striving for greatness anymore. If you think about it, okay? The world we live in today, in the year 2025. This is the world we live in. It's a atomized, uniform, and mediocre world. So how did this happen? How was it possible for the world to become like this? And for you to understand this, it's important to go back to the Dutch Republic. We discussed the Dutch Republic last week and talk about what it means to be middle class. Now, as I said last week, the middle class It's distinct because it creates anxiety, uncertainty, and competition within the lives of individuals. Anxiety comes from the fact that your situation is never stable. You can be rich tomorrow, but you can be poor the next day. This is different from history, where if you're born poor, you stay poor. If you're a noble person, you can have no money, but your status stays with you. And it goes, passes on to your children and your grandchildren. So there's a certainty in that world. But in this world, if you're in middle class, you could be a factory owner, you could be Jack Ma, and then the next day, you get unlucky, you lose all your money. You're back to being a poor person. This creates anxiety and uncertainty. Also, because status is not given, but it must be earned, there's competition among middle class members to strive for status. And this creates something we call OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. And it leads to an obsessive control of yourself, a focus on cleanliness, and a desire to accumulate and achieve. And if you think about it, we discuss the memoir of Benjamin Franklin. Well, why is he focused on such a simple living? Why is he focused on earning so much money? Why does he constantly want to achieve? It's because of the anxiety of being in the middle class. You're born poor. You earn a lot of money. you become wealthy, but how do you know you won't become poor? How do you know your children won't become poor? The only way to resolve this anxiety is by constantly accumulating more and more. So let's look at democracy in America. Let's look at certain passages from democracy in America to understand the thinking of the Tocqueville. Such a democratic society would be less brilliant than the aristocracy, but also less plagued by misery. Pleasures would be less extreme, prosperity more general, notch would be less exalted, but ignorance more rare. Feelings would be less passionate and habits milder. There would be more vices and fewer crimes. Okay, this is actually a hard passage to understand. So what he's saying is this, in historic societies, in most societies, there's a huge gap between the rich and the poor, okay? And there's a huge gap between the great and the mediocre. What democratic societies do is they take this system and they turn it into this system. So the middle class, they're not that great, but they're not that poor either. They're not as talented, but they're not as mediocre. So you're taking this system, right? And you turn it into this system. And that's a theory of democracy. And in theory, this sounds better. If you're just born randomly into a democratic society, you're much more likely to live a happy life than if you were born into an aristocratic society. So that's a theory. But the Tocqueville spent a lot of time looking at America and he decided that's not what happened. It's not that you went from this to this. It's like you went from this to like this. All right, so he explains. But what have we done? In rejecting the social state of our ancestors and casting aside the institutions, ideas and mores, what have we put in their place? So what he's saying is the American Revolution was about destroying tradition, about destroying civilization, but they failed to build new traditions and new civilization. The prestige of world power has evaporated, but the majesty of the law has failed to take its place. Okay, this is key. Before we worshiped a man, a king, and the king made us obedient to his law. We got rid of the king and we said, well, let's keep the law. The problem is this, the problem is, people respect and revere those who are superior to them. They do not respect and revere ideas and things and laws. Does that make sense? Okay? So in theory America is a rule of law nation, but people don't really understand these laws and people don't revere these laws as much as they would a superior man. It strikes me that we have destroyed those individuals who once had the width of all to battle tyranny on their own. So in a historic system, what will happen is you have these great individuals like Robes PR emerge to challenge the system. And he feels, and he's supported by others because others see the injustice of the system. But in democracy, what happens is great individuals or oppressed by the conformity, the tyranny of majority. Does that make sense? If everyone's happy, then you say, if you come out and you say, listen, this system is wrong, people will shut you down. In the historic, everyone knows what's unjust, so if you come out and you speak what's unjust, people will follow you. And the democracy in middle class society, which is conformist, you're not allowed to question popular opinion. and therefore no great man can arise. If you think about it, in American history, there aren't that many great individuals. It's a great country, it's very wealthy, but think about how many great individuals who've arisen. What's also unique about America is the people they worship are not generals, not leaders, but business people, Henry Ford, Ellen Musk, Thomas Edison, right? These are all business people. That's who they worship. The poor man for the most part clings to his forebears' prejudices without their faith and to their ignorance without their virtues. Okay, so the Catholic Church was problematic, medieval Europe was problematic, but at least people knew how to live a good life. Now, if you're a poor person, you're completely lost in the system. Okay, you expect to have your own virtues, you're expected to discover your own purpose in life, But if you don't, then you're alienated. And this creates a huge problem that we'll discuss later on. All right, it continues. I see man who in the name of progress seek to reduce men to material being. This is the ultimate problem in America. Before, in civilization, you were asked to die for your nation. Now, you're asked to go make money and buy things. Materialism. They look for what is useful, what concern for what is just. They seek science removed from faith and prosperity apart from virtue. Having styled themselves champions of modern civilization, they have erically placed themselves at its head, usurping a position abandoned by others, which they are quite unworrying of occupying themselves. Okay, so in this system, the worst rise to power. The best are trampled down by conformity. All right, it continues. I'm trying to imagine what new features despotism might have in today's world. I see in a new promo, hosts of man all alike and equal, endlessly hastening after petty and vulgar pleasures with which they fill their souls. Over these men stand in immense, totally power, which assumes sole responsibility for securing their pleasures and watching over their fate. Think about the society that we live in today, the entire world. Before we were asked to sacrifice ourselves for civilization before we were asked to be great to work together. Now we're asked to just buy things. Buying things will make us happy. And it's responsibility of the government to ensure we can buy things. Okay? That's the world we live in today. It's impossible to believe that a liberal, energetic, and wise government can ever emerge from the balance of a nation of servants. If you're a consumer, if all you're concerned is buying things, you are just a slave. The possibility of a constitution being Republican in its head and ultra-monarchal in all its other parts has always struck me as an enthronal monster. We think we live in democracy. We think the government listens to us, but it's really the hypocrisy that's in charge. And that's a monster. The vice of those who govern, the imbecility of the governed, would quickly bring about its ruin and the people tired of their representatives and of themselves would either create free institutions or soon return to prostrating themselves at the feet of a single master. Okay, so this is a prophecy. The prophecy is this. America, the way it is structured, the way it is conceived, is not sustainable in the long term. Either it will break apart in a civil war or a time will emerge. It will become a monarchy. That is, the Tauquist dark prophecy for America. OK. So America is, again, in competition with these other civilizations. All right. So what I will do now is just summarize what we've learned to give you a broad framework for understanding the nature of American society. OK? So I apologize. I know that today was very fast. But let me just summarize what we've learned. And you have a much clearer idea of the ideas today. All right. So before the focus on civilization, what is civilization? It is a history, culture, values. And before everyone understood, the purpose of your life was to maintain, protect, and defend your civilization. But there's certain problems with civilization that emerges over time. The first, of course, is the idea of prejudice. You just believe that your civilization is superior to that of other civilizations. Everyone believes this. My civilization is better, and my civilization is superior to yours. So this is prejudice. It leads to war, violence. It leads to lack of innovation, openness. It's a stubbornness, inflexibility. It also limits immigration. Does that make sense? This is the nature of civilization throughout most human history. Now, this is a problem for America. Why? Because as I mentioned, America was founded by immigrants. It's also pretty diverse, diversity, openness. And so these are the three characteristics of America. It's a very diverse place with different religions, different cultures. It's always trying to welcome immigrants in order to build up its nation and wealth. And it has to be open because it needs to steal ideas from Europe, basically. All right? So they have a problem. Right? Civilization cannot solve these problems. So what do you do in order to create a society? What you do is, rather than build a civilization, you create a game. Okay? In many ways America is an anti-civilization. It's trying to remedy the failings and weaknesses of civilizations in the past. It's decided we're going to quit a game guys. Okay? That's the idea of the US Constitution. What's a game? The game is this. First of all, we need to have game masters. Game masters is the government. But the problem is for the game to work, it has to be fair. It has to be clean. Okay? It has to be winnable for people. Does that make sense? You only play games if you think the game is fear and it's winnable and it's rewarding, right? It's transparent. Therefore, our government must be fear, transparent, and democratic. Do you have as many people to play the game as possible? All right? Once the government is in place, now what we do is we create the rules for the game that are fair, just, and which is winnable. So the purpose of this game is to make as much money as possible, material acquisition. If you win this money, it's yours, property. By law, whatever you earn, whatever you have earned, is yours forever. It's yours, but it's also your children's. You understand? game that America has constructed. If you think about it, this is great because now you can bring in as many immigrants as you want. Because all they do is play this game. They want us to play this game. It allows you to be open because it allows for rapid innovation within your society. It allows for diversity as well because everyone's striving to make as much money as possible. So that's what America is. sees itself as a news civilization, but it's really an anti-celeration because it's really a game. And over time what will happen is because America is becoming more and more wealthy, it will be able to conquer the world and establish the game throughout the world. In China today, we are playing this game, right? What do we believe? We believe that we come to school because we need to get an education, go to America, get a degree, so that we can become rich. When we come rich, we can buy things, right? We're playing this game. We've all been brainwashed to play this game, okay? The problem with this game is, eventually the few will win everything. Does that make sense? Massive inequality in the world. And when this happens, people are like, this game sucks. What do we do now? And then people will be like, you know what? I miss civilization. I miss when it was clear what my identity was, when it was clear what I had to do in life, when I was asked to make sacrifices for the greater good. I miss that. I'm not nostalgic for that, OK? And of course, this is what gives us MAGA, all right? Ultimately, MAGA is about trying to restore the idea of civilization in America. Make America great again. Make America into a white Christian democratic nation again. Let us restore the vision of Thomas Jefferson. OK, that's it. So this is just an introduction to America. We will continue this topic as we move further and further along the course. So next week, we will do the German and Russian civilizations. What you will see is that in many ways, these civilized things are forced to be arrear to the Anglo-American Empire. All right? So any questions? Okay."}

Today we finish the French Revolution trilogy. So we are focusing on Napoleon today. And my argument to you today is that Napoleon would not have been possible about Rope's PR. Okay, so to illustrate this point, let us do a thought experiment. I am going to present to you two individuals. Okay? And I want you to think about who is the greater genius, who is the more rare leader. So let's look at person A. Person A has a perfect memory. That's the first characteristic. He is able to have instant recall. He or she is able to absorb all the information that comes, here's how we're going to be able to retain it. Second thing is the ability to have priorities. So what we are among really smart people is the capacity to prioritize what is important information and what is not important information to filter things out, okay? Because once you have the important information, you are much more capable of making the correct decisions, right? Now third thing is the strategic imagination. So a general is able to take all the relevant information that he or she has obtained, and then imagine the battlefield across multiple nations. He or she is able to imagine how the battle will progress. And the fourth is the idea of flexibility. So even though the general has a plan, he or she is still flexible during the battle. So if the battles are going according to plan, then he or she will make adjustments to the battlefield because he or she has total battlefield awareness. So these are the four characteristics of a great leader. Now, listen to that B. And B only does one thing. B is I promote the talented. That's all B does. That's all B cares about. So who among these two individuals do you think is the more rare individual, the greater leader, a stronger genius? A or B? So obviously it's a trick question. It's obviously B. And so what I'm going to do today is explain why it's B. Because A is Napoleon. Napoleon, like Alexander the Great, like Julius Caesar, is a genius of war. He's able to completely imagine the battlefield and come up with strategies that are shocking, innovative, and unique. That's Napoleon. B is Robespierre. All Robespierre cares about is promoting and rewarding those who are true and loyal to the revolution. Okay? So I'm gonna make you, today I will make the argument that Robespierre is the greater man than Napoleon. So to illustrate this point, I want to ask you a question. Let's just say that I'm a very rich man. Maybe I'm Jack Ma. And I have a huge company. I employ thousands of workers. I'm extremely profitable. I have a son. He's 18 years old. And he's expecting to inherit my company at 40, 50. But I say to my son, I sit him down. I have a very long dinner conversation with him. I explain to him, son, it takes a particular type of person to run a great company. It takes dedication, it takes virtue, it takes selflessness. You're a great person, I love you, because you're my son, but you're not qualified to run my company. I have a team of experts who will replace me after I'm dead. I'm sorry, son, but you have to go do something else, okay, because quite honestly, I don't think you would even enjoy running my company. Okay, so that's a thought experiment, right? Now let me ask you this question. China has one billion people. Would there be anyone in China who would think I'm a good father? No one, okay? That's why B is hard, because B requires a selflessness. But not only that, but B requires the capacity to ignore social values and focus on what is good by itself. Okay? That's why B is harder than A. And quite frankly, A, in history, we won't meet a lot of individuals like that. Julius Caesar, Napoleon Hitler, even today there are quite a few individuals like A, but B is weird, all right? So let me explain why B is so weird and why Rose Pier was fundamental to the birth of Napoleon. All right, so we're gonna focus on a battle. This is 1805, Austro-Liths. This is considered Napoleon's greatest battle, okay? The battle that made Napoleon into a legend. This is something called the War of the Third Coalition. So Napoleon, the French, are up against three major nations, right? The Austrians, the Russians, and the British. The Prussians will come in at some point to join the Third Coalition. So Napoleon needs to act first and knock out both Russia and Austria before the Prussians come in because pressure is considered at this point the greatest military in the world. So this is Auschwitz, the battlefield. Let me first give you an overview of what the battlefield looks like. First of all, you have the Coalition forces stationed on high ground. These are about 30,000 troops. is scattered, okay? He's got his forces here, and he's got his forces here on the right. This is a right, and these are his main forces. Okay, this is Napoleon. He also has about 70,000 troops. So they look even, but actually the coalition forces have a huge advantage. One, because they're on high ground, okay? Second is that they are coming, more forces are coming in from behind to to bolster the forces. So it looks in the beginning like the coalition forces will overwhelm Napoleon. But, and so what the coalition forces are going to do is this. They see the right flank of Napoleon it's weak. So what they will do is they will send a right attack and overwhelm overwhelm the right, and then come behind Napoleon, and then the other forces will come down to envelop Napoleon. This is what we call a flanking attack. So that is the plan. And quite honestly, this is the most logical, the most reasonable strategy given the circumstances. What they don't know is this. Napoleon anticipates that they will do this. It's a trap, actually. is what's going to happen is that as they come and attack, Napoleon will now attack the coalition's right flank. And as the coalition tries to muster the right flank, the cavalry will come in and split the coalition into two, forcing them to retreat. That is some answer to the plan. The problem with this plan is the right flank. The right flank needs to hold against the coalition attack. Otherwise the coalition would just sweep in and outflank Napoleon. Napoleon has his plan where coming in to bolster the right flank is his marshal, DeVau, with 10,000 men. Okay, the problem though is that DeVau is 100 kilometers away. So it has to be a really quick march to the right flank. Okay, now if he misses, the coalition will just wipe out his army. But he does get here in time, he saves the right flank and then the rest of the plan goes exactly according to Napoleon's vision, his strategy. It is perfect. Perfect timing, perfect attack, everything is perfect. And as a result this is exactly what happens. Napoleon splits the coalition into two, they're forced to retreat and then what will happen is that Napoleon will sweep in and capture this entire army. Once this happens, the war is over. The Russians and the Austrians are forced to retreat. The Austrians sue for peace. The Russians go home. So this is considered one of the greatest battles in human history. It is up there with the great battles. This is considered the defining achievement of Napoleon. And there are certain characteristics about this battle that make it uniquely Napoleon. The first is total battlefield awareness. That's the first thing. He is able to imagine an entire battlefield, even before this battle starts. He knows exactly where each unit will be. So total battlefield awareness is what makes Napoleon unique. What also makes Napoleon unique at this time is the idea of speed. This all happens very, very fast. At this time in Europe, battles are fought slowly and it's really like two forces banging against each other, okay? But this is really fast and what you have is a lot of maneuverability, okay? Okay? Usually in the battlefield, the army fights as one unit. What's amazing about Napoleon is he's able to divide his forces into different smaller armies that operate independently but as part of a larger vision, okay? So our solid is the defining achievement of the Polian's grand strategy of war. And if you go to military college, if you want to be a general, you will have to study this war, this battle in great detail, all right? So the problem with this plan is that it should not have worked, okay? It is a reckless and stupid way to fight a battle, because there are about 10,000 ways that could go wrong. First of all, you need this guy, DeVoe, to come in. He has to do about 110 kilometers in 48 hours. This was before considered impossible. A really strong army, really disciplined, really well trained, will do at most 20 kilometers in one day. OK, think about that. This is the best army in the world. The Prussians will do 20 kilometers in one day. The vote is able to do 110 kilometers in two days. All right? And that just shows you how extremely disciplined the French are. Not only are they able to do 110 kilometers in 48 hours, but they come into the battlefield fresh for battle. OK? They jump straight into the battle, and they are pushing the coalition forces back. So it's an incredible achievement by the vote. In fact, if you study Lutheran history, you will see a lot of people argue that the vote was the far superior general to Napoleon, okay? Because it takes a lot of skill to marshal your forces and organize them in a way that they will want to march that fast and not quick on a time, okay? So the first thing that must have happened is the vote had to come in time. But you know what, there could have been rain, right? He could have gotten lost. And the army could have come in and blocked his events, right? So 10,000 things could have gone wrong. Napoleon was really lucky that these things didn't go wrong. Also, in this attack by the French, it was possible that the coalition could have overwhelmed an attack. So in other words, the thing about Napoleon that's really important is, yes, his strategic genius is one thing. But what really matters is the offers are under him. He had a really talented bench of officers who were committed to the battle and they knew exactly what they had to do. Napoleon was the one with a vision. He was the one who had the courage and the bonus to attack, but it was they who executed the plan perfectly. And that's the defining characteristic of the Grand Army of Napoleon. So let me explain to you how how this happened, okay? How was it that the French was able to build Europe's greatest army during the French Revolution? All right, so let's compare the Prussians and the French. And the Prussians, again, are considered, at this time in European history, the greatest army ever, all right? So they are run by the nobility. The officers, the generals, are nobility. And they are called the yunkers. This is very important. I want you guys to remember the term yunkers. They are the elite of part of society. They're the ones who will take Germany into World War I and World War II. They are the force behind Hitler. And they are considered the greatest warriors in European history at this time, the Yonkers. They are land of nobility. They have their land. And so they can focus completely on warfare. And as time progresses, they become the greatest generals and officers of Europe at this time. Let's look at the soldiers. The soldiers come from three sources. The first is conscription. Conscription just means that you draft people from your nation to join the war. Second is volunteers. What do people volunteer? Because you're often treated better in the military than you are in a nation. If you're a soldier, the nobility can't beat the crap out of you for no reason. But if you're a peasant, the nobility can beat the crap out of you for no particular reason. And the third, which is the most controversial, are deserters. So the Prussians have a Nazi reputation for arresting people who they believe ran away from other armies, like the French and British army. And they are forced into the Prussian army. It's like basically prison. Now they have a Nazi reputation because a lot of these deserters, actually not deserters, they just happen to be people from neighboring nations that the Prussians kidnap into their army. Okay, so you have these three main sources. Now, the thing that makes the Persian army unique in Europe is it actually has very strict requirements for joining the military. You have to be tall, basically. You have to be like five, eight. The average height was like five, six at this time in Europe. Napoleon himself was five, seven. You have to be five, eight, okay? So Napoleon would not have been able to join the Persian army. You have to be five, eight. It's the tallest army in the world. The Persian king, Fethel the Great, has takes tremendous pride in how tall his warriors are. Okay? All right, so this extremely disciplined army, but with this army comes three fundamental weaknesses. Okay, the first is they cannot afford to lose that many men. Okay, these men are extremely well trained, extremely well disciplined. They cannot afford to lose that many soldiers in battle. Okay, that's the first problem. Second problem is they're extremely slow. Why are they slow? Because the officers like to live well. So wherever they go, there's maybe like three or four different wagons that carry their food, carry their clothing, carry their servants. So this is a very slow army. But it's fine because every other army in Europe is slow as well. And so this creates a problem of inflexibility. The Prussians fight one way, and that's the only way They fight. They basically move up front and because of the discipline of the soldiers, they overwhelm their enemy. They don't have that much flexibility in their army. So these are the three fundamental weaknesses of the Prussian army. They cannot afford casualties. They're extremely slow, and their strategy is inflexible. But it's not a problem because every army in Europe suffers from the same problems. Now comes the French Revolution. The French Revolution and Ropes Pier takes charge of organization and personnel, hiring basically for the new French Revolution Army. And he makes radical changes to the French military. The first is the idea of meritocracy. Okay, so before like every army, most of the French army, the officers, the generals, were of nobility that were appointed by the king. They were loyal to the king, and as such, Ropes Pier saw them as a threat, right? So he basically replaced the nobility with young men from the provinces who believed in revolution. So at the beginning of the revolution, about 85% of all officers French were nobility. Five years later, it's about 3%. That's a huge, huge change, okay? One of these men that's recruited into the French military and promoted very really fast is the Polian. The Polian by the age of 25 is a general and that's unheard of at Europe at this time. But it's not just a Polian, It's like dozens and dozens of really talented young men who are given opportunities they would not have been given anywhere else. Also what's important first, remember, is that Napoleon himself is not French, he's Corsican. Okay, he's a foreigner. But because of French Revolution, he's given these tremendous opportunities. All right, so that's the first thing, it's a meritocracy. Second thing is, it is total war. In other words, it is complete construction. There are no volunteers, there are no deserters. It's everyone must now join the army. Okay, so now France has almost as ends supply of soldiers. And that gives the French three major advantages. The first is high casualties. They can actually afford now to lose a lot of men in battle. So the French are now willing to take risks that other armies are not able to take. For example, Austerlitz, right? Auschwitz was a huge, huge gamble that paid out for the French. But they were able to do so because they were able to replenish their forces if need be, high casualties. Second is the idea of mobility, speed. So now you don't have any officers where you can travel really fast. Also, your soldiers can just live off the land. You don't have to feed them great food. They can just go and find berries or chickens to cook for themselves. So they are able to travel at least three times as fast as their enemies. That's an incredible advantage because even before their enemies are able to set up camp, the friends have surrounded them and overwhelmed them. This happens a lot during these wars. So speed is the crucial factor. And the third advantage is flexibility. If you have an extremely dedicated army, what you're able to do is you're able to divide them into different units called corps. This is no different from the Roman legion. The Roman legion was the main tactic of the Roman army back in the old days. So what you do is you take a huge army, you divide them into small armies. And if they're able to travel really fast, what this army is able to do is really quickly surround the enemy. If you surround the enemy, the enemy is dead. The biggest problem in war is being in circle. because you cut off the supply routes. They don't know how to respond to encirclement. So the French for many years was just destroying the enemies because of these three factors. They're able to take high casualties, their speed, and their strategic flexibility in battle. And who created the system? Ropespear created the system. Ropespear. Not Napoleon, Ropespear. So to give you an illustration of what the difference is, let's go to year 1806. So the French have destroyed the Austrians, the Russians are in retreat, the Prussians come into battle now. And all of Europe is like, oh wow, the Prussians now have taken the battlefield. The Prussians are gonna overwhelm the French because the French are just passing recruits, the Prussians are tall, they're strong, they're fearless, they're gonna destroy the French. So for the first time since the revolution, the Prussians and the French meet in 1806. Okay. It is a total and other annihilation, okay? Never before has Europe seen this. The French in 30 days wipes out the entire Prussian army. It is incredible to watch. Also, there's a very famous battle during this time where Deveau, he's a court leader, and he gets lost. And he ends up fighting the entire Prussian army. Okay? You know about this battle, right? And he's out number two to one. He wins the battle. The Vaux is able to win out number two to one against the main Prussian army, led by the king himself, okay? So this is a radical revolution in military affairs. The French, by using the system, is able to dominate Europe for most of Napoleon's ring. And what this does is, and this is really important, is because the French are dominating the battlefield, it forces the other European powers to make fundamental changes to society. Because of the French Revolution, these sides are forced to become more liberal and democratic and open and progressive in order to defeat Napoleon. So after 1806, the pressure to make a lot of major changes to society. What they recognize is that our soldiers are enough. We need to change the fabric and structure of our society if we are to defeat Napoleon. So they make two major changes. There are other changes, but there are two major changes that are fundamental. The first is they abolish serfdom. Serfdom is basically like slavery, where the peasants are tied to the land. And that's the majority of people. When you abolish, serve them, the advantage of that is now you can have more construction. These prices are now able to come and become soldiers because serves are not allowed to be soldiers. Okay? So now your army, the numbers have increased and so all the armies at this time are increasing because they're allowing more people to join the military. Okay? And the second which is most important is the middle class. So before the French Revolution, all of Europe was extremely structured stratified society. They were really at the top, but because of Napoleon's victories, the Prussians allowed the middle class to join the civil service. That's fundamental, okay? They are now activating the energy of the middle class. And this allows for innovation. It allows for more economic activity. And so 1806, even though the Prussians are destroyed, it allows them to build the structures that will allow them to dominate all of Europe in about 50, 60 years time. And eventually, they will become the dominant power in Europe and the world basically before the beginning of World War I. And this is all possible because the Prussians lost to the French and they learned lessons from the French Revolution. That's why I keep on saying the French Revolution was a turning point in human civilization. So that is my main argument. Are there any questions about this argument? Okay, so surfdom, okay. All right, so the idea, the institution of surfdom, it's basically slavery, where peasants are tied to the land. They cannot leave the land. And this is important because, again, most of these societies are agricultural based. So many people actually work the land. And as such, the majority of your population is not eligible for the military. Okay, that doesn't make sense. When you eliminate surfdom, Now every man is eligible for the military. And as such, you can, um, replenish your forces. And a lot of men want to join the military because there's a lot better be a soldier than there's to be a peasant, right? As a soldier, you are given rights by the military, okay? These are military, they're a powerful institution. If you're a soldier, you can't be pulled around by anyone. Whereas if you're a peasant, you're a serf, you, I mean, you're like an animal, okay? So if you give people a choice, whether to join a military or be a surf, they would choose to be a soldier, even though there's a risk of death. Okay, right? But if a soldier comes to possibility of social mobility and social respect, which is not available to you if you are a surf. Okay, does that make sense? Great. Can you brush that back? You can score that. That's your different. That's right. That's right. You add me all in a minute. Yup. Yes. Are those ideas? Is it more of like a screen to call it like, We're just a bunch of young men moving up in the world and this is our new identity as a material. Yeah, okay, that's a great question. So the beginning of revolution, these revolutionaries were compelled by sort of a religious fever to die for the nation. And Robespierre became the role model because Robespierre sacrificed himself for France. But in 1804, what happens is Napoleon becomes emperor. And once it becomes emperor, everything changes. Because now you're not fighting for your nation, you're fighting for your emperor. And there are a lot of French people who fell for trade by Napoleon. So after 1804, this is really important, French is still the greatest military in the world, but it's basically a military cabal, okay, who run France. Napoleon is just the head of a group of generals who love war, who benefit from war. And as such, France becomes a military nation where everyone's supporting the French military adventurism. And even though the French do win a lot of wars, eventually because you're an empire, you're just exhausted, everyone. But I will discuss this during the PPT. So thank you. Any more questions before I go into the PPT? So one last point is why is Rolfspeyer creating a meritocracy? The reason why he's creating a meritocracy is, remember, he's trying to create a new society. And there are a lot of threats to this new society. Obviously, the major threat is these foreign armies of the Prussians, the Austrians, the Spanish who want to restore the bourbon monarchy. That's a major threat. Then you have these rebels, these peasants who want to restore the privileges of the Catholic Church. That's also another major threat. But the main threat is actually the army itself, right? Because remember, 85% of the army is nobility. And there were actually a few times when the army wanted to march against the revolution and restore the monarchy. And the generals didn't do that, even though they wanted to, because they were afraid that the soldiers would mutiny against them. So this is a huge problem for Robespierre. And that's why Robespierre spearheaded the movement to replace nobles with ordinary men like Napoleon, which give Napoleon opportunity to rise among, to rise within the ranks, okay? Does that make sense? That's the logic of the revolution, all right? All right, so let us now go into the details of this. Now that we've done an overview. So, sorry. All right, so the question we were looking at today is, how did a nobody, okay? And this guy literally was a nobody. He was from an island called Corsica, which was not even French. He was part of the French Empire, but it's not actually French. He grew up speaking French, but in a very bad accent. So people made fun of him in school. His family was local nobility in Corsica, but they were poor. So this guy was literally a nobody. And in only, I don't know, like a decade, he became Emperor of France, the French Empire, which at that time was the main power in Europe. So how is this possible? How did the nobody in Napoleon become Emperor of French? Okay, so for us to understand this, remember what the French Revolution was. These three classes we've been looking at very closely at the French Revolution, and my argument to you is, it was a religious crusade. The irony of course is the French Revolution was trying to remove religion from social life. But if you look at what actually happened in the French Revolution, it was the ultimate religious crusade where the people were willing to sacrifice their lives in order to build a new society based entirely on reason. Their new God was reason, okay? Another idea I want to remember is that mythologies are prophecies and prophecies are plans of action, okay? So embedded in your subconscious on the mythologies of society. In France at this time, these mythologies included stories of Jesus but also the stories of Exem the Great and Julius Caesar. Napoleon saw himself as the reincarnation of both Exem the Great and Julius Caesar. And he wanted to create a mythology that he was in fact the Messiah. So these mythologies are there and Napoleon saw this as an opportunity in order for him to amass power for himself. That was his main insight. He was not a great general. That is one of the major misconceptions out there. He was not a great general who was not as good as Neville was, but he understood that the underlying framework for society are mythologies. If you control these mythologies, you can control people. You can become the emperor. That was his major revelation. So three things to remember. Mythologies are part of the collective subconscious. We are all in society governed by the mythologies that we share together. That's the first idea. The second idea is that when collective consciousness, authority breaks down, these mythologies begin to drive history. So when you remove your teachers, it doesn't mean noise and charge, it just means that now these mythologies are in charge, okay? So think of the cultural revolution in China. You could remove these authority figures, but then your subconscious takes charge. And the third idea is certain individuals will act out the leading roles in these mythologies and capture the imagination and attention of everyone else. That's why Napoleon became emperor, because he saw that the French were looking for a mausoleum. And he's like, I will become your mausoleum. And he did that by acting it out, but pretending to be XI the Great, but pretending to be Julius Caesar. And I'll show you how later on. So that's a mean idea we're looking at today. And Napoleon himself said this. This is a very famous quote that he said. while he was in exile in St. Helena. Okay, so he's basically writing his memoirs. He's reflecting on his life. And he's not that perceptive. He's not that bright. But in this quote, we see his plan, his, like how it became ample, okay? Let's read this. I saw the way to achieve all my dreams. I would found a religion, right? He's not like, I'm not a general. I am a religious leader. I saw myself marching into Asia, mounted on an elephant, a turban on my head. That is actually the great. That's actually the great Caesar. And in my hand, a new Koran that I would have composed to suit my needs. A Koran, a Bible. So he understood what the French Revolution really was. It was a crusade to bring reason into the world. And he would become the Mohammed, the Julius Caesar. That's actually the great, the Jesus that would achieve this crusade. Does that make sense? He understood this from the beginning. And that's why he was able to succeed. Whereas Rosepear, he may have understood this, but he refused to act out that role. So even in his beginning, the beginning of his career, he was focused on creating mythology for himself. This is when he was first a general and was part of the Italian campaign. And this is a mythology of him leading his warriors into battle. This didn't really happen this way. Doesn't matter. Because he understood that what matters is how people perceive you. The underlying reality doesn't really matter. So when he was emperor, he was focusing on a corner personality, paintings of himself, stories of himself that would become the official history. So a lot of stuff that we know about Napoleon, his victories, we have to be suspicious about. Because he was so focused on creating a myth of himself. All right, so let's go over some details that we discussed. So when Luther 16 was in charge, the French army had a lot of problems. The first problem was you had too many generals, 578 generals, 180,000 men, that's a lot of generals. And the reason why they had these generals is they were friends of the king. They were incompetent, they were necessary, the king liked them, and so the king promoted them. is a way to ensure the mobility was loyal to you. But that made for a top-heavy bureaucracy that didn't allow for innovation and change. So that's the first problem. Second problem is 85% are nobles, harsh discipline. Soldiers didn't want to fight. They were forced to fight. No conscription, volunteer army, basically deserters. One third would desert every year. One third of soldiers were run away every year. So that's why this army is problematic, okay? And that's why the Prussians, the English would defeat the French in many battles before the revolution. All right, so this man is named Carnot. And he's actually a friend of Ropes Pears. They became friends when Ropes Pears was in his provincial town of Eris. They'd known each other for a long, long time. And when Ropes Pierre became prominent in the revolution, he asked his friend, Carnot, to come up with a new system of reorganizing the military. And Carnot, he's a mathematician and scientist, he came up with the idea of conscription. Let's call it levé and math. So let's get everyone to join the military so as to dilute the influence of nobility. And it works for Tacto well. And because he's a mathematician, he was extremely well organized. He is one of the main conspirators against Ropes Pier. Because when he amassed power, he recognized that he couldn't really benefit from his power. Ropes Pier was too virtuous. He demanded on everyone making sacrifices. And so these people that Ropes Pier promoted, that Ropes Pier favored, would eventually conspire against him. And one of these men is Carnot. And Carnot is also important because Carnot would make Napoleon a general. So the thing about Napoleon that makes him distinctive in the military is he's very good at coming close with local patrons. He's very good at identifying local patrons and getting them to help him in his career. All right, so as you can see, because of construction, the French army is increasing and that forces the other armies of your between crease as well. So you can see the spike. And during this time, because of all these reforms in military, many young great generals are merging in the French military. So Napoleon is the most famous. But there are others who are actually just as good, even better than Napoleon. Okay, dozens of them. And these generals will become the core of the French military. All right? And all of them are driven by a republican idealism. Okay? become a republic, they want French to be free, they want to spread the revolution all across the world. Not only are they devoted and idealistic, but also they're soldiers. The soldiers are willing to die in battle, whereas the others, whereas other nations are not. Okay? The vote we talked about, okay? Without the vote, there's no way Napoleon could have won his battles. The vote is probably the greatest general at this time. So, so, Carnot makes Napoleon a general. And why is Napoleon given the general ship? Because Napoleon does the, Carnot a favor. So after Ropespear's death, a director set up to basically be the dictatorship of France. Okay, five men dictatorship, which includes Carnot. And also Paul Barat, who is also another patron of Napoleon, as well as a friend of Ropes Pier. And at first, after Ropes Pier's downfall, both Paul Barre and Napoleon are under investigation because they are friends of Ropes Pier. But because they are extremely politically flexible, I mean, he is the opposite of Ropes Pier. Ropes Pier was virtuous, he's very cynical. He's your perfect political operator. He's able to become one of the leaders of the directory and he helps promote Napoleon's career. Napoleon helps them because at this time there's a mob, a Paris mob that threatens the directory. And what Napoleon does is he fires cannon at them. And as a general, you're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to actually go kill your own people. But Napoleon, he is ambitious, he's merciless. And so the director owes him a favor and he asks for a genuship of the Italian peninsula. Why? because that's where Julius Caesar is from. And in the Italian peninsula, he wins a lot of battles. The record is mixed, it's not as great as people make it out to be, okay? But after the Italian peninsula, what's interesting is, he then goes to Egypt. Why? Because actually the great went to Egypt. And Julius Caesar went to Egypt, okay? So even at this particular stage in his career, he understands how to create a mythology of himself, right? I am the new Julius Caesar, I'm the new Ex-Immigrate. And it works, okay? Because in 1799, Paul Barra, as well as Eddie Moseyes, who is now the head of the government, they get sick of the Republic. The Republic, it's corrupt, it's ineffectual. They want to establish their own dictatorship. But for them to establish their dictatorship, they need a general to help them out, okay? So they need the army on their side And they go to different individuals. They go to first general, Merle, who is right now considered the best general in France. He's the most respected. And Merle decided with them they would have no issues with their coup d'etat. But Merle, he's a staunch Republican. He refuses. He's like, no, this goes against the revolution. This goes against the legacy of the world's peer. I refuse to join in your coup d'etat. So then they go to McDonald, okay? At this point, McDonald is like, I don't want to do this, but have you talked to Napoleon? Okay? And so they go talk to Napoleon, and of course Napoleon wants to do this. Napoleon's been dreaming about this. He wants to be the new Caesar who crossed the Rubicon and ends the Roman Republic. Okay, and so what happens is Napoleon launches a coup d'etat in Paris. And at this point, the great fear is the mob of Paris will rise up against Napoleon, but they don't. because Napoleon has done such a great job of creating mythology of himself as a messiah, right? And at this point, after the death of Rhoadspier, people are looking for a messiah. So Napoleon gets away with it. And then what he does is he knows that now that he's dictator, he needs to fulfill people's mythology of him as messiah. So rather than just sit and enjoy being emperor, He decides to go to Italy again. So the first thing he does, which is really interesting, is he crosses the Alps. He crossed the Alps. Why? Because Hannibal crossed the Alps. And during in Italy, he makes a lot of really stupid decisions. So for example, he had the Austrian army encircled. So he had different forces surrounding the Austrian army. And what Napoleon was afraid of is the Austrian army would run away. But if you're a general in the Austrian army, you recognize that the French are divided, right? So I just bulldozed them, okay? So the Austrians launched this massive attack against the French, and the French are now being overwhelmed. But the French have incredible discipline, so they hold the line, but they're still being overwhelmed because they're outnumbered, okay? Napoleon comes in with his elite group, with his elite soldiers, and the elite soldiers hold their line, but 50% of them are killed. And so now the Austrians are just bulldozing the French, right? Napoleon is saved because another French army is able to come in and save them. So Napoleon is taking all these stupid risks for no particular reason and has all to create a mythology of himself as this great conqueror. Because what he recognizes is I don't have to win this battle because I control the government. When I go back to France, I'll just tell everyone I won and everyone will believe me. But what's important is action. I need action in order to create my mythology. All right, so after the Zetan campaign, what he does next is create a legend of himself as a new Messiah, who will lead the French people into the Promised Land, okay? This is the battle of Marengo, where Napoleon shoot up and destroyed, but he got lucky again. And in 1804, he makes himself Emperor of France, and this now destroys the revolution, because the Messiah is not supposed to do this. The Messiah is not supposed to make himself emperor. The Messiah is supposed to be selfless, like rose-peer, and lead the people to victory, to free the entire world. You're not supposed to become emperor, okay? Because once you become emperor, you have worldly needs. He makes now his brothers, emperors as well. He makes his brother, Joseph, emperor of Italy, as well as Spain, okay? He then makes his other brother, so this is Joseph, He then makes his other brother, Louis, king of Holland. So he's basically the vile of Europe among his family members. And obviously, if you are a French revolutionary who dedicated your entire life to promoting liberty around the world, you don't see this as a good thing. So the other thing about Napoleon is he was an extremely selfish individual. He was narcissistic. He was selfish. The reason why we know this is one thing that he spent a lot of time on is writing letters to his wife, the Empress Josephine. So let's read certain sections of these letters. So he writes to Josephine, since I left you, he's in campaign right now in Italy. I have been constantly depressed. My happiness is to be in New York. So he's obsessed with Josephine. He's a general. He's in charge of tens of thousands of soldiers. Everyday he's thinking about, hey, it's Josephine sleeping with another man. It's like literally what he's thinking. He's like, I know Josephine's sleeping with another man and I'm gonna be really angry when I find out, okay? That's what he's thinking every day. And we know because I don't love you anymore. On the contrary, I detach you, you are a vow, mean, beastly slut. All right, so this is what he's writing to his wife who's sleeping with other man while he's wearing a campaign. Also, my mistresses do not in the least engage my feelings, power is my mistress. So this is a megalomaniac, he's narcissistic, he's obsessed with obtaining as much power as possible. That's what drives him. What he recognizes is this. In order for him to maintain his mythology, in order for him to maintain his image as a messiah, he, French, needs to be constantly at war. So even though Napoleon could at this time just enjoy being emperor, instead he's constantly at war with everyone in order to maintain his mythology. Because the mythology is what controls the French people. If you don't have the mythology, they won't let you become emperor anymore, okay? And so, as a result, France becomes the largest empire in Europe, okay? So the blue, the light blue, it's all part of the French empire. He's controlled France, but he controlled Spain, Italy, parts of Prussia, Germany, okay? And the problem with Europe is, as I mentioned in previous classes, the geography. It's very hard to control all of it. So Britain is still impossible to conquer. Right now, Britain has the greatest navy in the world. France has the greatest land army in the world. Great Britain has the greatest navy in the world. And therefore, they can never be invaded. Russia is just too big to be invaded. They're still Austria around. And so now the French army, it is overextended and people have lost their revolutionary fever. They don't wanna die anymore for Napoleon. So now the French army, they're fighting all these battles, they're losing a lot of men, and these men are being replaced with just common people who don't really care about fighting. So now the French army is in decline. The training point, of course, is in the year 1812. And that's the year when Napoleon decided to invade Russia. And even though the invasion is a failed year, he's still able to escape. The problem though is that in Russia he's lost his cavalry. He no longer has cavalry in battle, okay? So that's a huge disadvantage. Also his soldiers are fighting a guerrilla warfare in Spain because what's happened is because of Napoleon's conquest, nationalism is on the rise. Before, people fought against Napoleon in order to restore the French monarchy in order to stop the revolution. Now people are fighting against Napoleon in order to secure the national independence from the French. In order to protect its religion, in order to protect their national values. And so the Spanish rise against the French, Napoleon, but also the Germans as well. So now Napoleon is way overextended and he no longer has the military that he once had during the Revolution. So eventually Napoleon is defeated. This is called the Congress of Vienna and it will lead to something called the consulate of Europe. And this piece is being mastered by a man named Mennonich. And Mennonich argues for balance of power. Let's just maintain our borders and let's not fight any more wars. Napoleon, his wars, killed millions of people. We are sick and tired of war. The people are sick and tired of war. That's why Napoleon was defeated because people wanted peace. Now, so this concept of Europe, this peace agreement, and we can think of this as actually like a proto-unite nations, okay? an organization dedicated to maintaining balance of power in Europe. It works extremely well. The Napoleon's defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and after that, there's no more wars in Europe, until maybe 1856 during the Crimean War. That's like 40, 50 years. So it's an incredibly successful formula. The problem though is this. If you don't let people fight wars, what are they gonna do? They're gonna revolt against you. Okay, so because of inequality, you have all this massive tension in society. So your options are either you take people to war and kill a lot of people, or these people will rise up against you. Okay, and that's what happened in 1848, during the revolutions, when all of Europe was in Gulf of revolutions. We will study this later on, okay? But I want you to remember this idea. 1815, the Congress of Vienna, Congress of Europe, Mino-Nik establishes peace in Europe. Europe. Okay? And they think this is a great thing. But then you have the revolutions of 1848, which threaten and destroy a lot of these monarchies. And so after that what happens? Well you now have continuous wars. Okay? So that's what the people, that's what the elite of Europe discovered because of the French Revolution. You can either have your soldiers go to war or they will revolt against you. That's your choice. And so this will take us into World One and the 20th century. So the Peace of Europe is one of the major legacies of the pressure revolution, but as I mentioned, another major legacy that we must not forget is the increase of liberalism in Europe at this time. There are many nations that start to adopt start to adopt French Revolution principles. But there are nations who are forced to adopt French Revolution principles like pressure, because they have no choice if they are to fight the war. There are other nations like Austria, which will adopt these principles later on. So even though Napoleon will kill a French Revolution, and Napoleon himself will be defeated by the Europeans, the French Revolution marks a radical turning point in history. For French Revolution marks the beginning of liberalism, modernity, humanism, a lot of great things that now define our modern world. We would not be living in the world that we live in today because, sorry, we would not be living in the world we live in today while the French Revolution. It is probably the most significant event in human history. All right, so let me conclude now by talking about these great figures that have emerged in human history and compare them. So as I mentioned at the beginning of the class, without Rosepear, Napoleon would not have been possible. All right, so this chart shows us how. You compare Rosepear and Napoleon. Rosepear obtained his power through virtue and dedication. He worked 18 hours a day. He was completely dedicated to the revolution. He had no girlfriend. He had no money. He was not being paid for his work. All he was doing was to ensure the revolution would succeed. And because of his dedication and virtue, The revolution was saved and they succeeded. So at Rose Pier the French Revolution would not have been possible. He was a prophet of reason. He believed that everyone had the capacity to reason. So if you present the logical argument people would understand it. And that was both the source of his virtue but it was also the source of his downfall because he could not imagine that his friends would conspire against him because they wanted to protect their own self-interest. And the third thing about Rose Pierre that's important is he saved the French Revolution. Let's compare him with Napoleon, who's the complete opposite. Napoleon got to where he was because of political maneuvering. He was able to identify political patrons early in his career and he did whatever they asked of him and then together they launched a coup d'état against the French Republic. And after Kudaitas succeeded, he betrayed his political allies. He amassed power for himself. That's how he became emperor. So Napoleon, he's a great politician. We think of him as a general, but he's really a politician. The thing about Napoleon that made him so successful is his myth-making genius. He understood that people are looking for myths, and he knew how to present himself as a mythic figure, like the Messiah. And as a result, he destroyed the French Republic. Now what's interesting is that, if you look at human history, figures like Napoleon appear always at the end of a republic, okay? So Napoleon killed the French Republic, but they have Julius Caesar, who is of the same personality, okay? Julius Caesar was able to identify political patrons very early on and outmaneuver them as a mass power. Julius Caesar was focused on creating a myth of himself as this unbeatable general. And as a result, he destroyed the Roman Republic. Later on, we will study Hitler. Guess what, guys? Hitler follows the same pattern. Hitler was able to amass power because he outmaneuvered his local patrons and allies. We will study this. Remember, the Nazis did not come out of nowhere. The Nazis were a force incubated by the German army in order to destroy the communist movement. And Hitler took advantage of this. Hitler got to where he was because he created a myth of himself as a savior of the German people, right? And then he destroyed the rival republic, right? Why is this important? Because it's entirely possible we are living at another inflection point in history where the American Republic may be destroyed. Trump, okay? How did Trump get to where he is? Political maneuvering. Why is he president? Because he has a myth making genius, okay? That's really important to understand about Trump. Everyone's like, Trump is a terrible business person. He's lost a lot of money. Trump doesn't understand terrorism. He doesn't understand economy. He doesn't care. He understands mythology. He understands how to capture people's attention. He knows how to instill an image of himself as a messiah in people's minds. That's what he cares about. He doesn't need to succeed. He needs to act. And then he needs to present himself in a way that captures people's imagination. What does Trump spend all his time on? He spends all his time talking to the press. That's his job, okay, you understand? His job is not to think about economics or military matters. His job is to talk to the press and create an image of himself as a messiah to the American people, okay? So the question then is, okay, well, listen. If we see this pattern, Napoleon, Caesar, Hitler are the same person. The results are the same. And Trump is similar to Napoleon, Caesar, and Hitler, what's gonna happen? I don't know, okay? All right? But, okay, and this is really important, if in fact in the next 10 years, and it will probably take 10 years, if Trump actually destroys the American Republic, okay? Then a pattern emerges in history, all right? And if this pattern is consistent, now we're able to control history because we're able to foresee and predict history. So that's the idea. Okay, that's it. Any questions? Was this clear to you guys? All right, good. Rose-Pierre. Okay, that's a great question. Why did Napoleon succeed where Rose-Pierre failed? Okay, so the difference is this. If I'm Rose-Pierre, I believe everyone is capable of reason, right? Therefore, you have a responsibility to reason for yourself. You understand? I will give you ideas, but you must come to your own conclusions. You must act independently of me. Okay? And Napoleon's like, no, no, no. People don't want to think. People want to believe. People want to obey. If I present myself as Messiah, and I tell people, follow me, and I will lead you to paradise. People want to follow me. Okay? And people love this confidence, right? There's charisma, there's confidence of Napoleon. Think of Trump, right? Maybe you and I think Trump's an idiot, but if you're a normal person, you believe that Trump, he is a genius, because he's so confident, right? People are attracted to confidence. Does that make sense? People aren't attracted to logic or reason, they're attracted to confidence and charisma. Trump tells everyone, follow me and the world will be fine. We will make America great again. And you're like, well, that doesn't make any sense. Doesn't matter, okay? He's trying to, what Trump has done is create a mythology that has captured people's imagination. And as such, people are willing to die for this. Does that make sense? That's what made Napoleon such a great military leader. Because he had this confidence and people just had to follow him, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, great question. Any more questions? Okay, myth-making, okay? Myth-making is, all right, This is reality. Why is Trump a myth-making genius? This is reality. These are things that you and I see every day. And then there's myths. These are ideas that we have about how society works, about how the world works. Now, of definitely speaking, Trump is a failed business person. His father was a great business person, Fred Trump, who built a real estate empire. And then Trump came along and took this empire over. And he almost bankrupted this empire. And so Fred Trump was spending a lot of his time thinking about how to make money. Like how do I make a great business? How do I hire good people? How do I motivate them? How do I steal more money from the government? So he was focused on the very specifics of running a business. Trump is like, no, people don't want that. People want to see a successful billionaire. And once a successful billionaire, he sleeps with a beautiful woman. I'm gonna find a beautiful woman and I'm gonna sleep with them and the press is reported and then people will like oh my god this guy is a God because all these people want to sleep with him therefore I should give him my money to spend to invest because he's a genius okay What people want is mythology of success Doesn't make sense so what makes Trump actually really famous is a show called the apprentice the apprentice It's a TV show it's made of and the show presents Trump as this extremely wise and forward-looking business person and it's the opposite in reality Okay, but what Trump understands is really important is people don't hear about reality People want to watch a TV show. That's exciting. That's interesting. That's fun So if I turn politics into a TV show and I'm watching all the time They will always want me to be president. Doesn't make sense. Yeah, because yeah okay so it's perception more important than reality and the answer is yes okay and the reason why is reality it is very hard it's very difficult all right people prefer simple idea simple myths that allow them to better navigate reality that's why religion is important. So what Trump is doing is he is creating a religion about himself. It's really the same idea as Napoleon says this. I saw the way he achieved my dreams. I would found a religion. I saw myself as marching into Asia, mounted on an elephant, a turban on my head, and in my hand a new corander I would have composed to suit my needs. Magnet is a new religion. Make America great again. Don't think of it as a political movement, think of it as a new religion. And I will explain to you why Trump is so powerful. Okay. I think Trump will be president of the United States for the next 10 years. It is very hard to remove him because like once you remove him, the TV show ends. You understand? Now you have to go back to reality. You don't want that. People want to live in a TV show. Exactly. Exactly. That's exactly right. People want to live in a dream. It's perfect. Thank you. People want to live in a dream because that's what makes life bearable. Okay. Does that make sense? Okay, that's a great question. Okay, so the argument against this is like, like Trump is a terrible economic leader. And so with his terrorist war against China, with all of these policies, it's just gonna make the American person more poor. Okay, so less money spent, the American won't be able to afford a house. Okay, so this is really important, but you have to think about people's psychology. All right, so sorry, let me write this down. Because it's a very important idea. You have to understand people's psychology. People are not capable of thinking in absolute terms. Does that make sense? Like, if I give you a bottle of wine, this bottle of wine, and I give you another bottle of wine, and I ask you to tell me which is better. You're not able to do it. But I told you this one is $50. This one is $10. You know this has to be better. You understand? So people's psychology is very interesting, but people cannot think objectively. People can only compare and contrast. So let's just say, okay, trade war. The American consumer is losing purchasing power, so the person is getting more poor. But if China's getting more poor in this time, right? So US goes down, but China goes down even more, people are happy. Do you understand? Okay, I know this is terrible, but this is true. I don't have to make you rich. I just have to make everyone else poorer and then you're happy, right? Make America great again. Make America great again. You understand? Being great, it's just a perception. I'm better than everyone else, and then I'm great. I don't have to be wealthy. I just have to be better off than everyone else. So the entire world is poor. America is happier. Does that make sense? OK? So that's a logic here. Trump doesn't want to make America wealthy again. He needs to make America a myth again. You understand? He wants to create the myth of a great America because the rest of the world is either at war or it's bank wealth or people feel hopeless. Did you understand? And honestly, he's right, okay? He's absolutely correct in this matter, all right? And that explains why he's doing what he's doing, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, great. Any more questions? All right, good. Okay, so we're taking a break and then when we come back from the break, start the British Empire."}

And last class we looked at Jean-Jacques Rousseau and how he is the philosopher-poet of the revolution. He provided the dream for the revolution. He told the French that there was a promised land of reason, where if you use your reason, which is God's gift to us, class, you could build a new society, a utopia, a kingdom on earth. And in today's class, we will look at Robespierre, Maximian Robespierre, who is a prophet, who will take his people into the promised land. All right, so he is the main instigator, the main leader of the French Revolution. And I'm going to make a very strange argument today about Rose Peer that no one has made before. So it's going to be very controversial, it's going to be very strange. So I will do this very slowly, okay? Basically I'm going to make the argument to you that Rose Peer saw himself as the second coming of Jesus. And because he did so, he sacrificed himself in order to save the French Revolution, okay? So that's my argument to you today. Again, it's going to be a very controversial, provocative argument, so I will work very slowly to explain it. All right. Okay. So let's go over some, let's review some information we discussed last class. That's very important. Okay. So as we discussed last class, traditionally in Europe, there have been two major groups of people. There are the peasants and the poor and the slaves. So basically the lower class, the underclass. And then at the top are the nobility and clergy. Now there's always been talent people. There's always been merchants and artisans and crafts people, but they're the minority. But because of the gun power revolution, as you're beginning to industrialize, these people are going in number and in influence and power. And we call these people today the middle class. And the middle class, it's an extremely diverse group of people. And you can simplify the middle class into three major categories. There's the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie member are the elite of the town. So these are bankers, lawyers, doctors, factory owners, industrialist, merchants, okay? So they are the elite of a town. Then you have what we call later the Poleteriot. The Polateriates are the lower class of a town. They include artisans, workers, they're often the majority. And then in between are what we call the Petite Vosgesie, or the Petite middle class. And these are just people who are just stuck in between these two major categories. They include school teachers, journalists, small lawyers, notaries, small business owners. So this is an extremely diverse group of people. Now, as we discussed last class, what often happens in revolution is that the people, Portrait Z will often become the counter elites. The counter elites are just those who lead the people to revolt against the elites. The Poleteriot will be the muscle or the army, okay? And Portrait Z are in a very unstable position Because at first, they will often support revolutions because they want more political power. But over time, they will become reactionaries. Or they will try to control the revolution or even kill the revolution because the revolution is threatening their economic interests. So this is the pattern that we see in human history. Okay, so let's go over some terms that we will need in order to understand the French Revolution. Okay, so what happens is this, the middle class is growing in France throughout the 17th and 18th century. In fact, they become the main economic engine for France. At this time, France is the most populous, the wealthiest nation in all of Europe. But it is an absolute monarchy. An absolute monarchy is one in which the king makes all the decisions. He decides whether or not to go to war. He decides who has the power. He decides who has to pay taxes. He has absolute power, an absolute monarchy. The absolute monarchy leads friends into a series of disastrous wars in the 18th century. The most prominent, the most important is something called the Seven Years War. fought between France and England, primarily. There are other participants as well. And this is a world war. This is really the first world war. You can actually call this World War Zero. It's fought all around the world, in North America, in Europe, in Asia. It's fought everywhere. And France loses this war. When you lose the war, you incur a lot of debt. But not only that, right after the Seven Years War, France sponsors the American Revolution. So France becomes the main economic, political, and military sponsor of the Americans in the revolution against the British. And of course, the Americans win this war. The Americans refuse to pay back the debt that they owe to the French. So these are two major wars that have now left France in very dire economic straits. In fact, they're treasury. It's empty. The government has no more money. Food prices are off the charts. People don't have enough to eat. There's no bread. The economy's in tatters. So what the king needs to do now is he needs to call an assembly of the people. And this is what's called the estate general. The estate general. This happens in the year 1789. And this marks the beginning of the French Revolution. And the purpose of this is to stay general. It's very simple. All the king wants to do is get these people the nobility, the clergy, and the middle class, bourgeoisie, to agree to give them more money, to pay more taxes, to replenish the treasury. Of course, the middle class, everyone in the middle class is like, this is a bad deal for us. We are the main economic engine for France. We pay the most taxes, we do the most work, but we have no political power. Therefore, we should have some political power. In fact, we should check the power of the king to declare war and to raise taxes, okay? So they want a constitutional monarchy. At this time in history, no one is saying that they should depose the king and declare republic. No one is saying that. All they want is a more, a greater diffusion of power. Less power for the king, more power for the people. That makes sense. But of course, the king and the elite don't really like this idea. And the king, this is Louis XVI, and he's very indice in the size of it. He wants to maintain the absolute monarchy, but he lacks the cutthroat mentality that he would need to achieve his power. So he should have set in the military to kill everyone, but he didn't want to do that. He goes back and forth. And so what happens is now the state general breaks off. In the state general, there are three states, three major groups. The first estate is called the clergy, the Catholic Church. The second estate is the nobility. The third estate is everyone else, the commoners. So what happens is the third estate breaks off and they form something called the national assembly. And they use the national assembly as a mechanism to press for more rights. And the national assembly, because it's made up of most of the members of the middle class, you have different groups, the Poleteria, the Petit Bourgeoisie, the Bourgeoisie, they argue amongst themselves as well. So what's happening now is that within the National Assembly, these political groups, political clubs, are forming in order to divide strategy and to consolidate ideology amongst themselves. And the most famous of these clubs are called the, you guys remember, the Jacobins. Have you guys studied this history? Okay, the Jacobins. But anyway, the Jacobins. The Jacobins, and this is just a meeting place for revolutionaries to come together and discuss ideology. How do we best proceed? Now over time, as the revolution develops, the Jacobins will split off into other groups, okay? And the reason why they split off is because the economic interests, the political economic social interests of these different groups do not align with each other. So from the Jacobins, you will emerge the folens. The folens represent the bourgeoisie. They don't want any economic change. They want political change. They don't want to have a more equal society. They just want more power over the king. So these are conservatives. But then you will also emerge the gerondins. The Germans are lower, Borscht or C. These are merchants, these are tradespeople. And what they want is war. They want France to clear war against their enemies, Austria, Prussia, basically. And the reason why is if there's war, they can make money off war. Because these are merchants, these are tradespeople, these are industrialists. So they see war as an opportunity to enrich themselves, the speculators, basically. and these are called the De Ronians. And then you also merge the Cordilliers. And the Cordilliers represent a more extreme faction of the Jacobins who want universal suffrage. They want the Poleteriot to have more rights. Okay, at this point the Poleteriot is called the San Colat. The San Colats, okay? These are very important people because they provide the muscle for the revolution. Saint-Colote is French meaning without breaches. So the custom at that time is that if you are a middle class person, you wear like silk socks, okay? But they're expensive. So the lower class in Poleteria, they cannot afford these socks. Therefore they're called the Saint-Colote. The Saint-Colote. And the Coloteurs want to governize these people to create a full revolution where the complete social, economic, political, and religious order is over thrown. Then you have people call the herbertists. And what they want to do is overthrow the Catholic Church. So throughout this revolution, over time, you have different groups emerging with different political interests within the middle class. Does that make sense? But at the same time, you have threats to the revolution. So the main threat is the king. Because the king is a bourbon, and his brother is king of Spain. He has relatives over Europe. So he writes to Austria pressure to ask for aid. He'd come in send your army and crush this revolution for me because my army is not listening to me. So the king is conspiring against the revolution. There are these invasions from Austria and Prussia. And then England also sees the revolution as a threat as well. Because remember, every nation has a new class, and they're afraid that the middle class and their nations will rise up against them as well. So you have these external threats coming in, and then you also have internal threats. You have counter-revolutionaries, the nobility who try to raise their own armies to crush the revolution. He also, economic collapse going on, okay? So the revolution at this point, and they are 1990, 1991, it seems threatened. So what happens is that someone emerges from this chaos to lead the revolution. And his name is Maximilian Ropes-Pierre. Okay, Maximilian Ropes-Pierre. And Ropes-Pierre, he is just a provincial lawyer, okay? He is not from Paris, he is from Arau, a province in France. He's a lawyer and he's part of the Petit Bourgeoisie. And he's not imposing, he's that huge. He's not powerful, he doesn't have a faction behind him. And he's not extremely charismatic. He's almost like a nerd. But the thing about Rove's period is that he is completely convinced that the revolution must win and it will win if he works hard enough. He works 18 hours a day. The moment he gets up, he works. He gives speeches. He gives over 500 speeches in a national assembly over his career. He is extremely virtuous. He comes to Paris with no money and he leaves Paris with no money. His entire career as a lawyer, back in his hometown, he spent defending the poor and the weak against the powerful. And he has very clear ideas about how to proceed with the revolution based on Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He sees himself as a disciple of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Remember last class, we looked at Rousseau's ideas and how to implement a kingdom of reason. So Rolpes Pierre, because he is the most virtuous, He is the most, he has the most conviction. He becomes the de facto leader of the revolution. Okay? He becomes head of some kind of committee for public safety. And it's not a dictatorship, okay? He's not a dictator, but he's had a committee that advises National Assembly on how to proceed. And because he is the most forceful, he has the most ideas. His ideas usually win out. Okay? And over time, as he accumulates more power, he makes more and more radical proposals. His most radical proposal is called the reign of terror. The reign of terror is a time of mass execution, okay, the guillotine, in Paris. In order to solidify the revolution, in order to advance the revolution, Rövskir says, we must instill terror in our enemies. We must investigate our enemies and execute them if they are plotting with the king against us. If they are plotting with enemies against us. If they are conspiring against us. If they are engaged in economic speculation. If they're hoarding food, these are all enemies. They're trying to sabotage the revolution. Therefore, we must kill them, okay? So over a few years, three or four years, the Ring of Terror will kill at least 40,000 people within Paris alone, okay? We don't know in the provinces how many people are killed. The Ring of Terror will also execute the king and queen. So they will kill the king and queen as well, all right? So historians have been debating for a long time if the Ring of Terror was necessary because obviously it's a terrible thing to kill tens of thousands of people for opposing political opinions. And a lot of these people were in fact just political enemies of Ropes Pier. So how can we best understand the Ring of Terror? Well, if you think about it in this class, We've actually studied the reign of terror before, okay? It's the idea of human sacrifice. And we discussed this before. All societies engage in war, pre-modern times practice human sacrifice. So Romans did it, the Vikings did it, the Aztecs did it. The Aztecs were famous for doing it. So why would you do human sacrifice if you're engaged in war? Well, there are different reasons, and there are three main reasons. The first reason is you want to unify and energize the people. When people observe or they watch human sacrifice, when they engage in a spectacle, they become much more excited. They have bloodlust. We call this bloodlust, warlust. They want to kill now. They're excited to kill. That's one purpose. Second purpose, of course, is to terrorize your enemy, to put fear in your enemy, okay, that's obvious. And then there's the third reason, which is the most important. The third reason is to break taboo, okay? The break taboo. When you break a taboo, you are signaling that you are crossing a boundary. You've crossed a line, and you can never go back. You can no longer compromise. You can only move forward, okay? So the taboo they broke in the French Revolution is they killed the king and queen of France. That meant that now all of Europe would unite against the French and they would come an exact a bloody vengeance on the people of France. The enemies of France which include England, the Netherlands, Russia, Austria, Russia, the five most powerful nations in all of Europe, They will now come and they will not stop until they have avenged the dead king and queen. Because the French people have broken this taboo. The monarchs cannot allow the French people to get away with this. Because if they did, then this would encourage their people to rise up against them as well. So with the Ring of Terror, Ropespear breaks the taboo. And when you break the taboo, then you are now all in. You are fully committed to the revolution. There's no more compromise. There's no more surrender. There's no more going back into the past. You are now in the promised land. You are now in a new world. You must fight to the death for this world. Does that make sense? OK. But what happens next, and it's Very strange is, Wobespear has accumulated all the power in France. He's not dictator, he doesn't have the power to be dictator, but he's the facto dictator. And at this point in his life, he's only like in his mid-30s, he could choose to become king, right? He could be like, you know what? For the revolution to fully succeed, I need to become the dictator. And the people, the Saint-Colat, love him. The Jack of Inns love him. He would win. But at this particular stage in the revolution, he decides to just set at home. He goes into seclusion. He kind of gives up. And this gives time for his enemies to conspire against him. And he has a lot of enemies because this is the Ring of Terror. Robs pier is virtuous. And no one can be as virtuous as Robs pier. And his enemies think this guy is crazy. He's going to kill everyone who is not as virtuous as he is, and therefore we're all going to be killed at some point. So they decide to act first. So the National Assembly conspire to vote for his catenation. They vote for his death. And he does not resist. The most he does is he goes to the National Assembly and he gives a speech cursing them all. Okay? And then, but then afterwards they send soldiers to arrest him and he doesn't really resist and then he's sent off to the guillotine and then he's killed and that's the end of Rospir. And this is a mystery, a paradox to historians like why did Rospir fall? Why didn't he resist? Why did he just give up? Okay? All right. So to answer this question, I'm going to provide you with a new idea. Okay? And this is a hard idea, so please feel free to challenge me or ask questions. Make sure you're clear, okay? All right. So the thing you need to understand is this. In a time of revolution, when people reject authority, when people say, I no longer believe in God, I refuse to listen to my priests. The nobility is evil. I refuse to submit to the king. The question then is what takes charge? What guides society now? And the answer is mythologies. Mythologies are the subconscious operating system of society. Does that make sense? So what mythology does everyone in French know? Well, the story of Jesus, right? What's the story of Jesus? Jesus is persecuted for telling the truth, for trying to bring about a more equal, more just world. In fact, he is murdered, he's crucified, okay? It's crucifixion, okay? And the moment he's crucified, people discover that he's truly a son of God. And then after he dies, he ascends to heaven where he awaits a day when he has to return. And he does return in something called the Second Coming. And the Second Coming, Jesus will become the God of War, the Messiah. And he will lead his people into victory against the entire world. And once he defeats the entire world, he will build a kingdom of heaven, a thousand years of peace. And then after a thousand years of peace, heaven will come onto earth, we will all become immortal. And those who have been good will live in heaven, those who have been bad will burn in hell. Okay, the final judgment. Okay, so that's a story, a mythology that everyone understands, that everyone knows in France. And so even though the French Revolution was a revolution of reason when and they're trying to reject the Christian faith. The mythology is still in the brains. And this mythology becomes the operating system of the French Revolution. So, using this mythology, let's now ask ourselves, what happened when Rosepear died? Three things happened when Rosepear died. The first one that happened is, Rosepear became a scapegoat. A scapegoat is someone who takes a blame for all the crimes of the community. So the Ring of Terror is when the Parisians killed 40,000 people and some of them were more innocent. And when Rosepear died, he took the blame for the Ring of Terror, right? They killed him because they called him a tyrant. He's the one responsible for those 40,000 deaths. And he said, sure, I'll take the blame, okay? He becomes a scapegoat. That's the first thing that happens. Second thing that happens is he becomes a martyr for the revolution. He died in order to save the revolution. Rose here said to the people, if you need me to die in order to cleanse you of your sins, then I will do so. And I will do so because what matters is that my life, but the revolution. Okay, he becomes a martyr. And when he became a martyr, what he did was, He made people feel guilty for having persecuted and killed him. Okay. And so the third thing he becomes is a role model or a paragon, a hero. He's telling the French people, listen, I could have become king. I had all the power in the world, but I chose to sacrifice myself because what mattered most was the revolution. If you feel guilty for having killed me, then you have an obligation to the revolution to make the sacrifice necessary in order to save the revolution. So this is what happened. The moment he killed himself, he became a scapegoat, a martyr and a paragon of virtue, a hero to the people. People will feel guilty for having killed him and now they will transfer this guilt into promoting and saving the revolution. And so in other words, the moment that he died, Rosepear became Jesus. He became in the mind of the French people, second coming of Jesus. Does that make sense? Okay, so that's my argument to you today. And so over the rest of the class, we will look at the evidence. And actually the best evidence is how Rosepear died. Okay? So let's compare the death of Jesus and the death of Rosepear. And you will see they match up. They line up perfectly. Okay? So let's look at the death of Jesus. And then we'll look at Rosepear, his death. Jesus spends his life preaching the truth to the people and trying to build a more just an equal world. But he knows that eventually he must die in order to complete his mission. So in the last supper, he tells his followers, the disciples, one of you will betray me, betrayal. And of course this person's name is Julius Escariat, who betrays Jesus to the high priest of Jerusalem. So the first thing is to betray. But after the dinner Everyone goes to sleep and Jesus goes to a quiet place. Okay? He isolates himself. Why? Because he knows that the soldiers are coming to arrest him and to put him to death. Okay? The servants of the high priest are going to come and arrest him. The servants do come to arrest Jesus and Jesus submits. Okay? Submission. He does not resist. But one of his disciples, Peter, he sees what's happening and he rushes to try to save Jesus and Peter cuts off the ear of one of the servants of the High Priest and Jesus tells him no no no Peter go home this is what I must do by myself I must go with the with the hype to the High Priest okay he goes to the High Priest who then presents him to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate right and Pontius Pilate says Jesus you've been accused of crimes against your people, of defying the laws of your God. What do you have to say in your defense? And Jesus says nothing. Jesus does not defend himself. Okay? So submission. Okay? And then Paul is probably says, fine, if you refuse to defend yourself then I can only condemn you to death. So Jesus, he has to bear a cross. Okay? And he's going to hit the cross, the Jews line up and see him and they jeer him. They curse him, they spit at him, they throw stones at him and all this while there's someone, a soldier, a centurion following him and whipping him. This is called the passion. He is punished and then he is of course crucified and he's crucified it's the worst way to die. Thousands of people come and watch him get crucified and then die. Okay? That's the story of Jesus. Guess what guys? This story becomes the death of Ropespear too. So Ropespear is betrayed. He is betrayed by his political allies and friends. He helped these people amass power. And once they amass power and Ropespear gets rid of all the other enemies, they see Ropes Pier as the ultimate threat, so they can spar against him, okay? So it's a betrayal. Ropes Pier is asked to speak to the assembly. He does, okay? But he knows the assembly has already condemned him to death. There's no point in him arguing, okay? So what he does is, after his speech, he goes to a building, a town hall, and he goes to the second floor, and he is isolated from everyone, okay? He knows his fate. He knows he's going to come and kill him, and he just stands there. His friends, his most loyal followers, okay? Say to him, Robespierre, they're coming to kill you. Let's rally the people. Let's go to the sections, the St. Colot. We have thousands, tens of thousands of loyal followers. Let's rally them. Let's inspire them to revolt. Let's raise an army and kill the entire National Assembly. And Robespierre refuses, okay? Then you have the Paris Commune. Leaders from the Paris Commune, they heard what happened to Ropes Pierre. So they sent a delegation to the section and said, hey guys, we need to defend our hero, okay? And so you have this huge crowd moving towards the National Assembly. And they're waiting for Ropes Pierre to appear before them and said, fight, fight, fight. Okay? Defend the revolution, save the revolution, save Ropes Pierre. They're waiting for the hero to come out and lead them. Robespierre refuses to say a word. He just sits there, and when he's begging Robespierre, please Robespierre, we have to do something. Robespierre just, he stares off into space, okay? He's like Jesus at this point. He knows his fate. He knows his destiny. He refuses to fight his destiny. He submits, okay? Submission. The soldiers come, and his followers, They get into a fight, some people die, but a soldier shoots a pistol into the jaw of Rose Pier. And now he's covered in blood, and he's trying to wipe off the blood, but he's in pain. Even though he's in pain, they still take him to the guillotine, so the passion of Rose Pier. And he's being driven on a horse cart with his father's, and there's about 100 of them, to the guillotine. They'll be all massacred at once, okay? And thousand people line up on the streets to shout down the tyrant, down the tyrant, okay? They hate Ropes Pier. These are people who lost friends, family in the ring of terror. So they wanna see this guy dead. And ultimately then, Ropes Pier, then is guillotine. And that's the end of Ropes Pier, okay? Do you see how these stories line up perfectly? It is almost as if Ropespear is trying to act out the story of Jesus for the French people. That is his intention. That is his legacy. He wants people to understand that it was Jesus who appeared before them. And Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice because he loved his people in order to rally his people to save the revolution and fight off the enemies of France. Okay? These stories line up too well. Now, we know that this story is basically just mythology. But I keep on telling you guys, in history for us humans, mythology ideas are real. So Rose Pierre, remember this mythology, or subconsciously knows this mythology, and he acted out for the French people in order to inspire them, in order to fully realize the revolution. Okay? So, in other words, the French Revolution was essentially a religious mythology in which Robespierre volunteered to play the part of Jesus. Right? To be Jesus, you need to make the ultimate sacrifice. You need to sacrifice yourself in front of people, and that's what he did. Okay? After his death, people now see that he's Jesus, and now people are inspired to believe that there will be a second coming of Ropes Pier. Someone will come who will be Ropes Pier, and who will lead them to final victory against all their enemies. And this person's name is who? Who comes after Ropes Pier? Napoleon. Did you understand? So Napoleon takes advantage of all this mythology, and he uses it in order to become the king of France. Rho's fear refused to become king, but Napoleon will become king. And we'll discuss Napoleon's next class. And this will end our French Revolution trilogy. All right, so this is the main argument, okay? So I provide basically the basic story. But what's important for us is now to look at the evidence. Okay, so we're gonna look at the speeches of Rho's PR in the context of French revolutionary history. All right, to understand his mentality. Right now, what's really important is for us to understand his psychology and ask yourselves, if we'll hear, really believe he was Jesus or a prophet, then do his speeches, do his words actually provide evidence for this? Okay? And I will show you that in fact, there is evidence that he does in fact see himself as a prophet. But before I start the evidence, are you guys clear about this argument? Are you clear about the story I'm telling you? All right? Okay, it's clear? All right, good. So let's look at the evidence. Okay, that is a great question. Does Rupes here know that people will know? He doesn't, right? He can't know. And in fact, if you look at the Bible, the Bible is very clear. Jesus himself was full of doubt. He was not completely sure that people will remember him, okay? So that's the problem of faith. If you truly believe in the people, you will have faith in the people. You understand? So, it was an act of faith, right? Roach here never at any point said, hey, I am the prophet. I need to sacrifice myself in order to save the revolution, okay? He hints at that, but he never really says it outright. And so, he himself is an extremely conflicted person, right? There's a part of him that is pulling him towards his destiny, but there's also another part of him that resists against this. Do you understand? We humans are extremely complicated. Robespierre was a human being. Does that make sense? He can never be confident that this will work out in the end. But because he took that leap of faith, it radically changed human history. Because I believe, and I will argue this, if he actually didn't do this, if he actually the French is became king, right? If he sees the crown like Napoleon did, the French Revolution would have failed. And we really would remember the French Revolution and it really wouldn't change the course of human history. What I will show you next class is, because he did so because he sacrificed himself, it allowed Napoleon to defeat all Europe, okay? Without those sacrifice, Napoleon could not have become Napoleon, right? So, does it make sense? No prophet ever truly believes he's the prophet. who is a part of him that is doubtful, that is skeptical. But he persists nonetheless, and that will make him heroic. And this is true for all prophets. Does that make sense? All right, French Revolution. Maximium roped pier. Okay, so some basic biographical details about roped pier. He was born in a town called Ara, which is a province of France. His family there for a few generations was Borges-Z. They were all lawyers. His grandfather was a lawyer, his father was a lawyer. But his mother, Ropespier's mother died giving birth to a younger brother. They both both died. And then Ropespier's father left the family and died a few years later in Belgium or somewhere. Okay? So Ropespier went from Borges-Z to Petit Borges-Z. His family is still wealthy, but not as wealthy as before. Rose Pierre becomes at a very early age, maybe seven or eight. He becomes the man of a family. He's responsible for taking care of his younger brother and his younger sister. His grandparents are still pretty wealthy. They sent him to a Jesuit school where he excels academically. His ambition is really to be Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He wants to be a philosopher. He wants to be like a poet philosopher, like Jean-Jacques Brousseau. He writes a lot. He dreams of a better world. He's very idealistic. He becomes a lawyer. And as a lawyer, as I mentioned, he spends all his time defending the poor and the weak. He's a champion of the oppressed. The Estates General is organized. He goes and becomes a representative. And as I said, over the next few years, he rises to the very top. So the question we're looking at today is, how did Ropes Peer fall? Okay, so as I mentioned, before the stage general is called, Friends is facing economic financial collapse. And so King Louis XVI appoints Jack Necker to become the finance minister. The thing about Necker is that he understands that, listen, If you want people to pay more taxes, you need to give them more political representation. Okay, so Nekker becomes a champion of the middle class. He's worshiped by the middle class. Louis XVI doesn't really like what he has to say, and so they have this back and forth for many years where Louis XVI fires him, the people revolt, Louis XVI hires him back and fires him again. Okay, so this goes on for quite some time. Necker was become, okay, around this time, as the state general is being called in order to raise more taxes from the people, the Abbey Steyer, who's a clergyman, he writes a very influential pamphlet called What Is The Third Estate? Right, because the first, second, and third estates are being called. The first and second estates have all the power, the third estates has no power. So he writes a very influential pamphlet, asking the question, what is the third estate? And his answer is everything. The third is everyone in France, 99.99%. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it demand to be? Something. So during this time, pamphlets are like the internet of today. It's how most people get their news. And the pamphlets become extremely violent and call for radical change. May 5th, 1789, the three estates meet. King Louis XVI refuses to acknowledge the third estate. He refuses to meet with them. He refuses to heed their demands. So what happens is the third estate form their own national assembly, okay? And these people are radical. This is everyone in the middle class, the bourgeoisie, the petite bourgeoisie, the Saint-Colat. They want more political power. They want more political representation in government. While this is happening, people's mood is becoming more and more radical and violent. Okay? So the people of Paris, they don't have any bread, they're hungry, they're unemployed, they feel hopeless, they feel the king is aloof. So a group of people, they storm the Bastal. The storming of the Bastal happens on July 14th, 1789. And it's important because the national day of France today is July 14th. Why? Because on July 14th, the people rose up and stormed the fortress of the pastel in order to get gunpowder in order to have their own army. Okay? Not only that, but they killed the governor of the pastel and paraded his head in front of everyone. Okay? So people's mood is extremely violent. And this violence is happening all around France. It's been decades of economic stagnation, poverty, military defeat, people want a revolution. August 27th, 1789, the National Assembly declares a new constitution. This new constitution is something called the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. It becomes a basis for most constitutions in the world. Okay? This marks the beginning of a new age in human history. So let's look at a few passages from the Declaration of Rights of Man. For these reasons, the National Assembly do recognize and declare in the presence of the Supreme Being, the Supreme Being is the God of Reason, and with the hope of His blessing in favor of following sacred rights of man and of citizens. Okay? Do you understand? These rights were not given to you by the government, they were given to you by God. And these rights can never be taken away from you, okay? First, men are born and always continue free and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be found only on public utility. This is a radical statement. Everyone is equal in the eyes of God and therefore in the eyes of the law. If there's nobility, there's a clergy, it's only because we agree to give them this distinction based on their utility, okay? Based on the fact that they do public good for us. All right, so that's a radical statement. Second, the end of all political associations is the preservation of a natural and in-prescriptable rights of man. And these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression. These are the fundamental human rights. All government, all laws, all society must be based on these fundamental principles. Liberty, property, security, and oppression, resistance of oppression. Third, the nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty, nor can any individual or any body of man be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it. So what this is saying is now we have a new God. It's a nation state. France becomes a first nation state, and all authority derives from the idea of the nation. And no power can supersede the power of the nation. Does that make sense, guys? This is beginning of modernity, right? Four, political liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. You can do whatever you want, as long as you don't harm someone else. The exercise of the natural rights of every man has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same rights. And these limits are determined only by the law. Five, the law ought to prohibit only actions, hurtful society, what is not prohibited, but the law should not be hindered, nor should anyone be compelled to that which the law does not require. Okay, so this is a new idea of freedom, negative freedom, before it's positive freedom where you have to do certain things to become a citizen. Now it's like, if you're a citizen, you can do whatever you want as long as you are not hurting someone else and you're not bringing the law. And so this is where the modern idea of freedom comes from. Alright, six. The law is an expression of the will of the community. All citizens have a right to concur either personally or by their representatives in its formation. It should be the same to all whether it protects or punishes and all being equal in its sight are equally eligible to all honors, places, and employment according to different abilities without any other distinction than that created by their virtues and talents. Not only is the government now responsive to the needs and demands of the people, the people can at any time become the government. So the people are above the government. So the hierarchy now is at the very top is the nation. And then below the nation, now it's the people. And then below the people, now it's the government. The government only exists in order to protect the rights of the people. So the government only exists at the behest and concurrence of the people. All right, number 10. No man ought to be molested on account of his opinions, not even on account of his religious opinions, Provide that as a vow of them does not disturb the public order established by law. So this is now the separation of church and state. You are free to believe whatever you want. 11, the unrestrained communication of thoughts and opinions being one of the most precious rights of man, every citizen may speak, write, and publish freely, provided he is responsible for the abuse of this liberty in case determined by law. You are free to say whatever you want. This is the freedom of expression. So the Declaration of Rights of Man basically defines the new liberal order. Last is 17. The right to property being invaluable and sacred, no one ought to be deprived of it except in case of evident public necessity, legally ascertained in our condition of a previous just indemnity. So property is also a sacred right. If you have our property, it is yours by the will of God. Obviously, Ropespear does not like this idea. So Ropespear gives a speech arguing against this idea, and he proposes an amendment to this idea. In the last session, this is Ropespear speaking before the National Assembly. In the last session, I took the floor in order to make a few important additions to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the citizen. It was my intention to expand your declarations of a theory of property by the addition of a few articles. Let the word property, but then no one. Feel free souls who value owning your money. I will not violate your treasures, even though I know how I can clean the source from which they are, from which they come, okay? So most of you are saying to everyone, I know you guys are rich and you all wanna protect your property. I won't take away your property. But please remember, every one of you stole this from someone else. This is how you became rich. through theft, through crimes. Okay? So, Roast Fear has a contempt for the wealthy. Ask anyone of these traders in human flesh what is property? Okay? How do people make money? For the slave trade, basically. He will show you the long coffin called a ship in which men are packed together and chained. Men who seem yet alive and he will tell you, look at my property, I have bought it head for head. It's a known fact that at this time in history, a lot of people are getting rich off the slave trade. Question this noble man who has goods and subjects and who believes that the world will come to an end now that he no longer possesses them and he will expound similar ideas on property to you. Which people love their land, they love their wealth. Question the members of the Capachyan dynasty and they will tell you that the most sacred property is the right of inheritance, that they have the ancient right of oppression, the 25 million persons now populating the territory of friends, of destroying them, of treating them legally and modestly according to their own world will. So what most of you are saying is that property cannot be a secret, right? Because property requires the oppression of others, right? How do you make money off land? By getting people to farm them, right? You're oppressing people, you're exploiting people. Therefore, this is a contradiction. You're saying that property is sacred right, that you're saying that God gave people this right. But God would never give you the power to oppress others. That makes no sense. You have increased the number of articles in order to afford the largest possible latitude, the right to one's property. And yet you have not added a word in limitation of this right with the result that the declaration might make the impression of having been credit not for the poor, but for the rich, the speculators, for the stock exchange strawbers, to remedy these defects I propose the following conditions. So he's saying at this point in the revolution, the entire middle class, including the bourgeoisie, are participating in this revolution. But he's also saying that you, the bourgeoisie, have written this constitution for your benefit and not for the benefit of everyone, for the people. So we need to make changes. First, property is that right held by each citizen that is disposed freely of that portion of the general goods guaranteed him by the laws. So it's society that gives people property, not God who gives people property, okay? There's a difference. Second, the right to property, like all other rights, is limited by the obligation to regard the rights of others. All right? So when you speak, you can do whatever you want as long as you don't harm others. Well, what Rosario is saying is that should also apply to property. You can own property as long as you are doing so in a way that does not exploit others. And the third is property may not cause any judgment to our security or to our liberty or existence or to the property of our neighbor. Only property should also not harm the national interests as well. So he's putting severe limitations on the idea of property. Because what Rothfair wants is a society based on equality of all. OK? Now, as this revolution is happening, There's a man named Joseph Ignence Gilaton who will create something called the Gilatine. He's a doctor and he wants to create a more humane way of executing people. The Gilatine will become the main mechanism of terror during the French Revolution. So if you are an enemy of the state, they will Gilatine you. As all this happening, the king is trying to work with the National Assembly. But the king is also conspiring against National Assembly by trying to write to his family and friends overseas to raise armies against the revolution. And on June 20 to 21, 1792, the King and Queen actually tried to flee France, but they're recognized and they're captured and sent back to Paris. A month later, August 10th, the people actually storm the king's residence and basically massacre his Swiss guard, the mercenaries who are paid to protect him. Finally, they decide to kill this guy because he's threatening the revolution. King Louis is always trying to conspire against revolution so they break this taboo. Because remember, many people believe that the king is a son of God and they kill him. And Rosepear is explaining why. And it's very simple. Louis may die in order that the revolution may live. It's that simple. What matters first and foremost is the revolution. In order to advance the revolution, everyone is expandable, including Rosepear. Rosepear is only the prophet of revolution. He is not the revolution itself. As is happening, there is now counter-revolutionaries. So in the Vendée, which is in West France, peasants are rebelling against the French Revolution. Why? Because French Revolution is calling for a secular state. It's calling for a negation of religion. And the thing about peasants is they love their religion. Okay? So the peasants are now rising up against the French Revolution. and it is a brutal war of genocide. Okay, there are massacres and atrocities on both sides. On May 31st, Rose Pier takes command of the National Assembly. This is something called the Montanacou, because he's in charge of a faction called the mountain. Okay, this is France for mountain. And of course, he then begins the Ring of Terror. Okay, and we discuss why he starts the Ring of Terror. He needs to unite the energies of people to commit them fully to the revolution, okay? We can't go back. There's no coming back after this, Ring of Terror. We have too many enemies now. The thing about the Ring of Terror is he kills his enemies, but more importantly, he's also killing his political allies, okay? The people on the left, he's also killing as well because they also threatened the revolution. So this is George Denton and he's one of the leaders of the court leaders, which as I mentioned is a very left-wing political group calling for universal self-reliance, for property rights, for the Senkalat. And he's seen as a threat to the revolution. And like Rospere, he's also fanatical. He's a fanatical prophet. So the National Assembly votes to condemn him to death And he says, I've said and I shall repeat, my home will soon be an oblivion and my name in a pantheon. It here is my head. It will answer for everything. My life is a burden to me. I shall be glad to be rid of it. He's like, screw you all. I don't care. I have done God's work. If I must rest, I shall rest. And then he's guillotine. Jacques Herbert is the leader of the Herbertists. He's a journalist. and he's calling for the complete abolishment of the Catholic Church. And of course the peasants don't like that. The peasants would all unite against you. So he's seen as a threat to the revolution even though he is a close ally of Rose Pier and Rose Pier also hasn't killed, okay? So Rose Pier is not just killing his enemies, he's also killing his friends as well. And it's all in order to advance the revolution. So now, Rose Peer needs to explain why this is happening. Okay, and he presents a vision of the revolution which tells us that he sees himself as a prophet. He's trying to build a new world. Right now there's a war between good and evil and good must triumph, no matter what the cost. All right, so his speech before the National Assembly to explain the Ring of Terror. To judge by the power and the will of a Republican soldier, it will be easy to defeat the English and the traitors. But we have another task of no less importance, but unfortunately of greater difficulty. This task is a task of frustrating, but an uninterrupted access of energy, okay? So the ring of terror is to energize the people, right? The eternal intrigues of all enemies of freedom within the country, and of paving the way for the victory of the principles on which the general well depends. So our true enemies are not the English, the Austrians, the Prussians, our true enemies are those traders within us. They're the ones who most threaten the revolution. This is another speech. What's the goal toward which we are heading? Why are we doing this? Why the Ring of Terror? The peaceful enjoyment of liberty and equality. Kingdom of, Kingdom on Earth, Utopia, Paradise, okay? A justice and equality. The ring of that eternal justice who laws have been inscribed not in marble and stone, but in the hearts of all men, even in that of the slave who forgets them and in that of the time who denies them, okay? This law, this justice, this equality is what God promised us because it's in planet in our hearts. yearn for this world when we're all equal, when justice prevails. We are fighting for the freedom and liberation of all humanity from oppression. That's why we're fighting. We seek an order of things in which all the base and cruel passions are in chains. So last class we discussed Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Remember Jean-Jacques Rousseau, his most famous line is, we are born free but we are all in chains. Okay? So this is rewriting of that idea. So what keeps us in us in chains are emotions. So we want a world in which our reason prevails and we are controlled over emotions. Then we truly liberated. All the beneficent and generous passions are awakened by the laws. Where ambition becomes the desire to merit glory and to serve our country. Okay, so your ambition is not to gain wealth at the expense of others. Your ambition is to help the community grow and thrive. Where distinctions are born only of equality itself. Where the citizen is subject to the magistrate, the magistrate to the people and the people to justice. Where our country assures the wellbeing of each individual and where each individual probably enjoys our country's prosperity and glory. where every soul grows greater through the continual flow of Republican sentiments and by the need of deserving the esteem of a great people. With the arts are the adornments of the liberty which ennobles them and commerce the source of public wealth rather than solely the monstrous opulence of a few families. Guys, he's talking about communism. He's talking about a world in which everyone is equal. Everyone is free to do what he or she wants And this will lead to the general prosperity, wealth, and happiness of the entire nation. Okay? So, Rosepear is streaming of a world in which everyone is equal. The great purity of the French Volition's fundamental elements, the very salinity of its objective is precisely what creates our strength and our weakness. Our idealism is what gives us power. Okay? Our strength because it gives us the victory of truth, over deception and the rights of public interests over private interests. Our weakness because it rallies against us all men who are vicious, all those who in their hearts plan to dispoil the people and all those who have dispoiled them and what impunity and those who reject liberty as a personal calamity and those who have embraced the revolution as a livelihood and the republic as it were an object of prey. So we are fighting a war of good versus evil. Among us are men of good who want to build a better world, who care for others. But there are also speculators among us who use the revolution in order to advance his or her interests. Okay? That's why we're fighting this war. We're trying to rid the world of those who seek to exploit others, who prey on others, who enjoy being bad. That's why we're fighting this war. Hence the affection of so many ambitious or greedy men who since the beginning have abandoned us along the way because they had not begun the voyage in order to reach the same goal. One could say that the two contrary geniuses that have been depicted competing for control of the realm of nature are fighting in this great epoch of human history to shape irrespectively the destiny of the world. And that France is the theater of this mighty struggle. This is the end of the world. This is the end of the world. This is good versus evil. Good must triumph. It must. So every sacrifice must be made. all the tyrants encircle you. Within all the friends of tyranny, conspire. They will conspire until crime has been robbed of hope. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or parish in this situation. The first maximum of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemy by terror. Okay, this ring of terror, it is about the ultimate victory against evil. We are killing our enemies because our enemies want to destroy all good in the world. If the main spring of popular government in peace time is virtue, amid revolution, it is at the same time virtue and terror. Virtue without which terror is fatal, terror without which virtue is impotent. Terror is nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice. It is therefore an emanation of virtue. It is less a special principle than a consequence of the general principle of democracy apply to our countries most pressing needs. We have to be as brutal as our enemies if we are truly to promote democracy. There's no other choice. All right, so the Ring of Terror is just one policy that Roefer adopts in order to save the revolution. But he also adopts a new religion called the festival, the call of the supreme being, okay? This is a new religion where God is the God of reason. So, Rolster is adopting a lot of different policies. And again, he is working selflessly in order to promote the revolution. But eventually, he gets exhausted. He just breaks down. He has a nervous breakdown because it's too hard. He wants people to be virtuous. He wants people to be reasonable. And everywhere he sees, he sees everyone in front of him and everyone's plodding against him. Everyone's trying to exploit the revolution for his or her own benefit. Okay? And eventually, Rose Peer is brought down and he is guillotine. Okay? But let us look at his last speech to fully understand how he sees the revolution and his own death. Okay? This is his last speech before the National Assembly. This is two days before he is to be executed. Okay? This is July 26, 1794. The enemies of the Republic called me tyrant, okay? The National Assembly is now calling for his execution because he's a tyrant. Where I such they would grovel at my feet. I would gorge them with gold. I should grant them impunity for their crimes and they would be grateful, right? If I'm a tyrant then I would make political alliances. I would bribe people. I would benefit people. But But I don't do that. I am incorruptible. I'm virtuous. Where as such, the kings we have vanquished far from denouncing Ropes pier would lend me their guilty support. So the kings of England, Netherlands, Austria, Prussia, Russia are all aligned against the French Revolution. Why? Because they are afraid of revolution at home. So Ropes was saying, listen, if I just became a king, they would marry their daughter to me and we'll all be one big happy family, okay? They would not seem as a threat. There would be a covenant between them and me. Tyrone must have tools. But the enemies of tyranny, whether it does their path 10, to the tomb and to immortality, what tyranny is my protector, to what faction do I belong, yourselves? Everything I've done is for the people of threat and you know this. Since the beginning of the revolution has crushed and annihilated so many detected traitors, you the people or principles are that faction, a faction to which I am devoted and against which all the scrambleism of the day is banded. It is because I, Wilfzier, am the only virtuous person who has fought for the revolution, now do you conspire against me. The confirmation of the Republic has been my object, and I know that the Republic can be established only on the internal basis of morality. Okay? Only if we are virtuous can we win out in the end against evil. Against me, against those who hold kindred principles, the league is formed. My life or my life I abandoned without a regret. I have seen the past, I foresee the future. I am the prophet. I have seen the past and I foresee the future. You will kill me. I accept my fate. What friend of his country would wish to survive the moment when he could no longer serve it? When he could no longer defend innocence against oppression? You have taken away my powers? Fine, take away my life as well. Because I serve, I live only to serve. Wherefore should I continue in an order of things where intrigue eternally triumphs over truth? Where justice is mocked, where passion is the most object or fear is the most absurd over the sacred interests of humanity? The revolution has been polluted. It is now corrupt. If you take my life, I would be glad to give it to you. Question history and learn how all the defenders of liberty in all times have been overwhelmed by calamity. All prophets in their time were prosecuted, including Jesus and Socrates. But their traducers died also. The good and the bad disappeared alike from the earth. but in very different conditions. All Frenchmen, all my countrymen, let not your enemies, with their desolating doctrines, degrade your souls and innovate your virtues. Now is the time to stand up and fight for the revolution. I may die, but the revolution must live. Death is not an internal sleep. Citizens, efface the tomb that motto, graven by sacrilegious hands which spreads over all nature a funeral crepe, takes from oppressed innocence its support and affronts the beneficent the discretion of death. Inscribe, brother, therefore these words. Death is the commencement of immortality. I lead to the oppressors of the people of terrible incestament, which I proclaim with the independence befitting one whose career is so nearly ended. It is the awful truth, thou shall die. Yes, today I die, but so will you. And when we all die, we must face our maker. We must all see God and we must account for our lives. I go to God in full conscious. I'm happy to go directly to God and await my fate. Okay, and these are his last words. Why should I wish to live under system where intrigue triumphs over truth? Where justice is a lie, where the basis passions and the most ridiculous of terrorists supersede in man's heart, the most sacred duties. Why should I regret to escape from the eternal torture of seeing this horrible session of traitors who by concealing the trapeitude of their souls under the veil of virtue and even of friendship will leave prosperity in doubt which was the greater, the cowardice or their crimes? You members of the National Assembly were elected to serve the people. You have only served yourself. You have only fought for your own economic interests. And because you seem as a threat, you see ropes pier as a man of purity, of virtue, of reason, you can spiral against me. And I am happy to be condemned to death because it will liberate me from this evil world that you have created. But upon my death, there shall come vengeance. Okay? So that's it, guys. That's ropes pier. All right? So does this make sense? He sees himself as a prophet who must say the revolution. At first he believes that he must kill his enemies, the enemies of the revolution in order to say the revolution, but then he recognizes that, no, no, no, this ring of terror, it's not really about energizing the people, it's really about eliminating the enemies of his allies. allies. It's really about political intrigue. And so he recognizes that if this revolution is to really triumph, then he must make the ultimate sacrifice. Rather than try to cease the crown, he must give his life for the revolution to set an example for everyone, especially the oppressed and the weak. And after he dies, this will energize France. It will unite France. It becomes a hurricane. The the French Revolution now becomes a hurricane. And Napoleon will come, he will take this hurricane, and he will unleash it on the entire world, and he will conquer the entire world. And that's what we'll do in the next class. We'll look at Napoleon. But does this make sense to you guys? Any questions? Okay, I go? Okay. Okay, so the question is, are people conscious of what Shakespeare is doing? And I know this is a hard argument. And I know this is hard to understand. But this is all happening subconsciously. This is all happening without people being aware of it. Role-spirit is not aware of it. The people are not aware of it. So the argument goes like this. First of all, mythology is the collective subconscious. Mythology is the collective subconscious. That's the first idea. Does that make sense to you? Second idea is this. When authority breaks down, the mythology takes over. Okay, do you understand? The argument is this. Usually someone on authority orders people around. Someone on authority, whether it's a general or a priest or a teacher, tells you what to do. But when you deny this authority, when you reject this authority, what tells you what to do? Well, mythology, your collective subconscious. You're guided by your collective subconscious, even though you don't know it. Now, third argument is that mythology is essentially a play. A mythology is a play. It's a story. And this play requires actors. So the leaders become now the actors. This play must take place because that's what people want. Now you need actors, you need volunteers to come and be the actors in this play. So whoever volunteers now must play that role and then people will follow that person. So Rolf's peer played the role of Jesus so people followed him, even though people don't really know why they're following him. Does that make sense? But they're following him because he's willing to play the role that's required of him in this play that's being acted out during the French Revolution. Okay? But, and this is really important. This play only works if people play the role they're supposed to play. When they speak the lines they're supposed to speak, right? That's really important. Because what happens is if people quick the role and instead of people, listen, I was just acting. The entire play dies. Okay, the play dies. Why is this important? Because in this class, we will look at Napoleon. Okay, in the beginning, the Napoleon's playing his role. Right, he's the Messiah come to earth to lead the French people to final victory against evil, to unite the world in good. He's playing that role. But then he does something that he should not do in which breaks the play and which is what? You guys know? What does Napoleon do that Ropsia doesn't do? That's right, he declares himself emperor. You're not supposed to do that, okay? If you're a Ropsia, you would never declare yourself emperor. You can make yourself for a citizen, you can make yourself council, dictator, whatever, but you cannot make yourself emperor because now you're like everyone else, right? And when he does that, and this is very important, he destroys the French Revolution. And after that, France is now destroyed by their enemies, Napoleon falls, okay? Doesn't make sense, guys. So only if you are playing your role can this play work out. Once this play works out, people are energized to sacrifice their lives. The reason why Napoleon at first could defeat all his enemies is his soldiers were not afraid to die. They didn't care. They were like, well, you know, if we die, we're going to heaven. That's what Wolfspear did. Okay, but we'll discuss this in the next class. Okay, does that make sense? So it's a hard argument to make because I'm arguing like there is a subconscious operating system to society that we don't ever see. Okay, we don't ever talk about it. But once we see this, okay, then it helps us explain the world we live in. It explains a lot of history to us. But you need to be able to see it first. And most people don't see it. If you look at the traditional accounts of the French Revolution, it's always these economic political structural forces. I'm presenting a different idea here. Does that make sense? Great. Any other questions? Yeah? No, no. The Ring of Terror was a form of human sacrifice. They literally took their enemies and they killed them in front of everyone. And that's no different from the Aztecs, no different from the Vikings, no different from the Romans. These are all studies that practice human sacrifice in order to unite the people, right? To galvanize the people, energize them, create bloodlust, to terrorize your enemies, and to break taboo, to tell, to set a message that we will never go back. We are going towards total victory. We won't surrender, we won't compromise. Okay? That's definitely the deal with Jesus. In fact, Jesus, the story of Jesus is to tell us we no longer need human sacrifice because Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? But, the Ring of Terror, what it did was unleash all this energy. Okay? And this energy, it's polluted energy because it's based on violence, on vengeance, on hatred. Right? So what Wolfry decides to do, and it's very clever of him, he needs to now to purify this energy. Right? And how do you purify this energy? by becoming a scapegoat, by sacrificing yourself, by telling the French people, the right way of terror was that your fault was my fault. Blame me, sacrifice me, okay? For what happened. I will take the guilt for the nation. I will cleanse you of your sins so that you may move on. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, good. Any more questions? Great questions, guys. Okay, all right, so this ends part two of the French Revolution. Next class on Tuesday is Napoleon. And this will end the TensorFlow Revolution trilogy. Okay?"}

And today we are discussing whether or not Trump will win in November. And I'm making the prediction that he will win in November and that he will pick Nikki Haley as his vice president. Okay, so let me make you the argument today. Okay, so let's first discuss why Biden won in 2020 and why it's possible that he may lose this year. So in 2020, it was a very special year in American politics because it was a largest turnout in American history since about 1900. So 74 million people voted for Trump, for Biden, 81 million people voted for him. And two out of every three American adults came out to vote, okay? So it was the largest turnout in American history. It doesn't, it sounds like a very lopsided victory for Biden, 81 million versus 74 million. But because America hasn't caught an electoral college system, which is not direct democracy, actually the margin of victory was only 65,000 votes, meaning that if 65,000 people in key battleground states flip their votes, then Trump would have won. So the margin of victory was very, very close, as is usually the case in highly contested American elections. So let's understand the coalition that brought Biden into the White House. Okay? So the first major component of this coalition are black people. 91% of all blacks voted for Biden, only 8% voted for Trump. That's a huge majority for Biden. So why did so many black people vote for Biden in 2020? Well, first of all, it's because Biden was Obama's vice president for eight years. And so a lot of older black people had a certain loyalty to him. Okay? They felt that we owe this man because he served loyally to our men, Barack Obama for years. And so now we must bring him into the White House. But this year the debt is paid off, right? So they won't feel so loyal to Biden. Okay? Also in 2020, there's something called a George Floyd protest. So what happened was that in May 2020, a black man in Minneapolis, George Floyd, he was strangled to death by a white police officer. It was captured on video and it caused a national uproar. In fact, there were riots and protests throughout the country. And Trump came out and did not acknowledge the pain that black felt because of this death. And so black people felt in sympathy towards Trump, okay? So these are the two major reasons why black people voted for Biden in 2020. But this year, Trump's not in office, right? Binds an office. So black people are asking the question, what has Biden done for us these past four years? And unfortunately, the answer is not that much. And in fact, you can make the argument that Biden has really hurt the set of living of black people. Why? Because inflation has gone up. When inflation goes up, it usually hurts poor people the most. The set of living goes way down. Also, illegal immigration has gone up. So in 2020, when Trump left office, There are about 10 million illegal immigrants in America. Now there are 20 million illegal immigrants in America, and it seems like Biden's doing nothing to stop this trend. And of course, when illegal immigrants come to the country, they usually take the jobs of poor people. They bring wages down. And that again hurts black people. And then third is Ukraine. So while the standard of living for black people and other poor people in America are going down, America is sending tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine to fight a war that has nothing to do with America. So many Americans see this as just bad leadership, okay? So that's black people. And recent polls show that actually Biden's lead with black people is not as much as it was in 2020, okay? So this lead is going down. Young people, okay? Young people tend to vote Democratic in all elections, and they were extremely galvanized to vote in 2020. They saw Trump as this very hateful racist that they must remove from office, right? And they were driven to believe this because of the George Floyd protests. Unfortunately, this year, young people may not feel compelled to vote for Biden. In fact, a lot of young people are choosing to set up a selection. Why? You guys know? Gaza, OK? So as you know, right now, throughout America, on college campuses, young people are protesting the war in Gaza. So these young people are not going to vote for Trump, But they probably will not vote for Biden as a protest against American policy via the Israel. Now let's look at the college educated. Okay, so 70% of people with college degrees voted for Biden. These are what we call the coastal elite, right? The coastal professional managerial elite. And they usually overwhelmingly vote Democratic. And this year, they will still see the same, but they will be less enthusiastic because of what they perceive to be poor global leadership. Under Biden's watch, Ukraine blew up, but so did Gaza. And many are starting to feel that it's because Biden comes across as too old, too weak, and too feeble to stand against Putin. Okay, so college educated people will still overwhelmingly vote Democratic. That is the core Democratic base But there will be less enthusiastic about Biden and they'll vote primarily against Trump. Okay Woman, okay, so 54% of women voted for Biden 44% voted for Trump, okay, and again because Trump is seen as this hateful figure, we expect that women will still consistently vote democratic this year, okay? And also because of abortion issues, right? So women are very passionate about abortion and they will come out and vote for Biden to ensure that abortion rights are protected. Last, let's look at suburban voters, okay? So the suburbs, the suburbs are between the cities, the urban areas and the rural areas, okay? cities, urban areas overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party. World areas overwhelmingly support the Republican Party. So the suburbs are where the battleground is. And so if you look at 2019, sorry, 2016, when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, only 45% of the suburbs voted for Clinton, Clinton, which allowed Trump to defeat her in the election. Now, what's interesting is that in 2020, this flip and 54% of suburban voters voted for Biden. That's a flip of 2 million voters. So in elections, usually it's a suburban vote that determines the election. because there's swing voters. So for Trump to win this year, he needs to win the suburban vote. He won that in 2016, he lost that in 2020. So let's examine very quickly why the suburbs went Biden in 2020. And there are three major reasons. The first is the media narrative. So what's happening throughout Trump's presidency is basically the entire mainstream media got together and criticized Trump. So the first major criticism of Trump, if you remember, is he was a Russian asset. He was a paid Putin puppet. And of course, that was just a complete lie, what we call a rush gate. But then they start to say that Trump was a divisive figure. And this idea caught the imagination of the suburbs. Because if you live in the suburbs, you tend to be middle class, you tend to be pretty wealthy and more educated. So you like the status quo. You want a leader who's conservative and who's a unifier. And throughout the Trump presidency, we saw the polarization of politics. the left and the right hate each other and they fought all the time. And what really showed this was the George Floyd protests. So you had protesters riding in the streets. And Trump was like, let's send in the military to crush the protesters. And so people in the suburbs were very worried about this. They thought that a leader, the president, should be a uniter. Right? And Biden came across as extremely steady, as very establishment, as someone who could unite both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Okay? That was his perception in 2020. So that's the first major reason why the suburbs went Biden. Second was the pandemic. So as you know, COVID hit the United States and the suburbs were extremely freaked out about this because they tend to have children who go to school, they tend to be older. And they thought that Trump's handling of the pandemic was very incompetent. Okay, he was an outsider, a political outsider, But that meant he could not get things done and wash them. So that's a second problem with Trump. And the third reason why the suburbs went, Biden is Kamala Harris. And this is key. Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his vice president, to be his running mate. And Kamala Harris, let me tell you a little but Kamala Harris, her father is Jamaican, her mother is Indian. And she has a younger sister, but when she was young, her dad left the family. So her mom raised the two girls by herself. And Kamala Harris is an extremely accomplished person. She went to Stanford, then she became Attorney General of California, then became a US senator. And there are three reasons why the suburbs love Camilla Harris. First of all, like us. Meaning she comes across as someone who speaks and thinks like people in the suburbs. Well-educated, articulate, smart, conservative. Second is she seemed as very establishment, meaning that she's not liberal. In fact, when she was attorney general of California, she was extremely tough on crime. She was trying to send as many people to jail as possible. And sometimes, quite honestly, some of these people were innocent, okay, and she still sent them to jail. Okay, that she was very controversial as attorney general. But guess what guys? People in the suburbs like tough on crime. They want safety, they want security, they have kids. And the third reason why they like coming out here is because of the redemption story. So in 2019, there's a democratic primary. This is when the Democrats tried to get a nomination for the general election, okay? And there was a lot of people who were vying for the nomination, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. In June 2019, there was the first Democratic debate. And at this point, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were considered very heavy favorites to win the nomination. And in that first debate, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden got into a very nasty argument on television, okay? So what happened is that Kamala Harris turned to Joe Biden and Joe Biden's kind of shell shocked, okay? He's kind of old and like Kamala Harris is directing her words at him and he doesn't really want to see her, okay? He doesn't really want to confront her. And what command Harris says to Joe Biden is, Joe, you've been in Washington, DC for 50 years. And some of your policies I don't support. For example, you do not support the integration of black and white students together. Well, you know what, Joe? I'm a black student. I was a black little girl, grew up in the 70s in California. And I got my opportunity to succeed in America because of integration, because I could go to white school and you opposed my opportunity to succeed. So basically, she was calling Biden a racist. And at that point, everyone thought that, okay, while Biden gets a nomination, there's no way he's gonna pick her to be the VP. Okay? And then he picks her to be the VP. And so what do people think about Biden? What do people think about it? What impression do people get because of this? Anyone? Yes, okay, exactly, okay? Doesn't hold grudges, what else? What else? What else? Doesn't hold grudges? He's a very forgiving man. What else? Good, yes, he listens, right? He's a listener. He's a team player. Okay? And he has empathy. Okay, he understands that voters want from their heroes. Okay, and guess what guys, these three things, doesn't hold grudges, listens, team player, and empathy. This is anti-Trump, right? This is the anti-Trump. And because of this narrative, woman, especially woman in the suburbs went for Biden, okay? Previously they had gone for Trump, now they went for Biden because as it turns out, Women want compassionate and pathetic leadership that is decisive and bold, but is also tolerant, okay? And this is also why even though Hillary Clinton like ran in 2016 and she was a woman, the suburbs didn't vote for her because she didn't come across as someone who was compassionate and forgiving and tolerant. Okay, does that make sense? And this is why Biden was able to win in 2020. So this year, what can Trump do to win the suburbs? What can he do? Yeah, he can copy this exact same thing, okay? And it turns out he can do this, okay? Why? Because on the reporting side, there's someone called Nikki Kelly, oh, sorry, Nikki Kelly. And Nikki Haley is very similar to Kamala Harris. Nikki Haley, her parents are Indian immigrants. So she's Indian. She's of South Asian descent. And her family was not very wealthy, but she worked hard and she became South Carolina governor for two terms. And then she joined the Trump administration as your ambassador in 2016. Okay? Now, what's interesting about Nikki Haley is that Nikki Haley ran against Trump in the Republican primary, okay? And even though she lost to Trump, there was a group of people who loved her. Guess who just loved her? Who voted for her in droves. Guess what demographic group? Anyone? Suburban woman, okay? You understand? College educated suburban woman, okay? So in other words, if Trump brings her onto the ticket, then it's very likely he can swing the suburbs back to him and win the election. But there's a problem. The problem is that Nikki Haley and Trump got into a very nasty fight during the primary, okay? So Nikki Haley said, listen, I served under Trump And I think he's a divisive figure. And right now in our country, we need a unifier. That's why I'm running for president, because I want to unite this country whereas Trump will can only divide this country. And then Trump, being Trump, responds and says, Nikki Haley is a bird brain. She's stupid. So you see this, you think like, there's no way Trump will pick her because Nikki Haley's not loyal to Trump, right? And Trump likes loyalty. Also, hey guys, Trump holds grudges, right? And he doesn't listen, and he's not a team player, and he lacks empathy. So there's no way he would pick Nikki Haley. And in fact, this past week, there's been news report that Nikki Haley is in consideration to be Trump's vice president. And Trump came out and said, I am not considering Nikki Haley, okay? But let me ask you this question. If in August during the Republican Convention, he does pick Nikki Haley, how would people feel about him? How would the media report this? Nikki Haley is an enemy of Trump. Trump called her a bird brain. Trump said, I will never pick Nikki Haley. And then in August, three months from now, he says, you know what I was wrong. I think Nikki Haley is the best person to be my VP. That's why she'll be my running mate in November. How do people feel about him? What would the suburbs think about Trump? How do you feel if you saw this? He's a changed man, right? Trump has grown. Remember, like the narrative about Trump is, he is a five-year-old child. And remember, like, people were like, Don't insult five-year-old children like that, okay? Five-year-old children are much more mature than Trump. So the argument about Trump is he's divisive, but much more than that, he's immature, he's incapable of growth, okay? But hey, even August, he picks Nikki Haley to be his VP, then the media will be like, he is a changed man. He's learned his lessons. He's willing to let go of grudges. He's willing to listen. He now has empathy. Therefore, he should be president. Do you understand? Then what happens is the suburbs switch over to Trump, and then he wins. So if he picks Nikki Haley in August, he will win. I'm not completely sure that he will pick Nikki Haley. I think that this is his best strategic move. But Trump is not really predictable. and who he picks as vice president will give us a good clue as to how he will govern when he becomes president. Okay, does that make sense? All right, now the question then is, okay, who is Nikki Haley? And what will she do as vice president? Okay, now what's important to understand about Nikki Haley is that when she left office, when she left Washington DC political office in 2018, She had nothing in her bank account. She had no money in her bank account. Now she has $10 million in her bank account. And she lives in a $5 million mansion. So where does she get this money? She got this money mainly for an organization called United Against a Nuclear Iran. And this organization's primary purpose is to create conflict between the United States and Iran. Okay? They go against any companies or individuals who support Iran, United States, who does business with Iran, okay? They are a very anti-Iranian organization. One of their main donors, his name is Sheldon Alderson. And Shondon Ellison is an extremely pro-Israel business person. He owns a lot of casinos, so MGM Sands. He's a billionaire. And what's interesting about Sandal Ellison, he's dead. But he was the main patron of a man named Benjamin Natanyahu. He is the main political patron and financial donor to Benjamin Nathanael. So Sheldon Ellison supports both Nathanael and supports this organization called United Against a Nuclear Red. And United Against a Nuclear Red hired Nikki Haley and paid her a lot of money, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing is that in 2019, she got a job of Boeing. Boeing is a weapons manufacturer. They make airplanes, but they mainly make bombs and missiles. Okay, so they love war. She sat on the board of Boeing, a extremely prestigious job, and she was paid 300,000 US dollars just to sit on the board and do nothing. Okay? She has also given speeches at an organization called Christians United for Israel. And you may remember that this is a 7 million strong organization that supports war in the Middle East, they are evangelical Christians, they are dispensation pre-millennias who believe that war between Israel and Iran will bring Jesus back to earth and establish the kingdom of heaven and therefore they want as much conflict in the Middle East as possible, okay? So all this is telling us is that If Nikki Haley becomes vice president, her main responsibility will be to agitate for war against Iran. She'll be the one in the White House pushing for war in Iran, escalating tension in Iran. So Nikki Haley, what's also interesting is, in January 2019, basically the primary is over. Trump has won everything. But in January 2019, even after Trump won, Haley was able to raise more money than Trump. So Haley got about $12 million from donors. Trump got $11 million. And the only explanation for this is these donors knew that Haley would not become president. She could not be Trump. but they were trying to position her to be his vice president by making her stay in the race and giving her as much publicity as possible. In fact, even though she dropped out of the race, she's still getting about 25% to 33% of all Republican votes, okay? So she comes across as an extremely popular exception figure. So does this make sense? So the conclusion is that given the situation in the United States, it seems very likely Trump will win in 2024, because the Biden coalition will not hold together because of inflation, illegal immigration, what's happening in Gaza, what's happening in Ukraine. Trump looks very strong right now. And the poll suggests that either the race is tied between the two, or Trump has slight advantage. Trump can basically seal the victory if he picks Nikki Haley to be his vice president, because Nikki Haley will turn the suburbs to him very strongly, and it's the suburbs that basically decide US elections. And as vice president, what she will be doing is agitating for war against Iran, which means that she's on the payroll of anti-Iranian forces in the United States. Okay, so any questions? Anything you're not clear about right now? Okay, so Jack asked a great question, okay? He's like, what if Haley holds a grudge and says no? Right? And quite honestly, she has been asked in the past, are you willing to serve as Trump's vice president? And she's like, no, because he's the vider. He's the vice-sif. And we need to move on from Trump. All right. Do you guys remember in class when we studied Trump very closely as personality? We looked at his days in the WWE. And there was a scene where Vince McMahon, the owner of WWE, a billionaire, challenges Trump to a fight, right? Well, guess what, guys? Politics is the same thing. It's all theater, okay? Politics is theater. What Nikki Haley and Donald Trump are doing is pretending to be bitter enemies so that their reconciliation will be so dramatic. You understand? So, Nicky Haley served under Trump in the first administration. Okay, so from 2016 to 2018 she was UN ambassador for Trump and everyone says that the two go along really well. In fact Trump was considering having her be his VP running mate in in 2020, who's thinking of dropping Mike Pence and putting her on the ticket, okay? So the two of them together actually have a great rapport. The two respect each other, they get along very well, okay? So that's the first thing. Second thing is that the thing to know about very successful politicians is they are first and foremost opportunists. They have no ideas, they have no principles, All they care about is political power, right? So why would Nikki Haley agree to be vice president? Why? Because it's one step away from the presidency, do you understand? If anything happens to Trump, she's president. And in four years' time, she can run as the Republican nominee for the presidency. Does that make sense? So that's the thing you need to know about politicians. All they care about is political power. They will do anything to achieve local power. They will sell their own mother to achieve local power. But the same thing for rich people. Rich people love money. They will do anything to get money, sell their own mother. Fine. You understand? Also, celebrities, famous people, all they care about is fame. So do you understand, Jack? All right. Any more questions? Is this clear to you guys? Is there anything you're not clear about? I'll explain further. Okay, so Jack asked a great question, okay? Well, listen, like, I can figure this out just by reading the news, right? Biden has an amazing team of extremely well-paid, professional experience strategists working with him. They know this, they can see what's going on. So what can Biden do to counter Trump's strategy or the polls, okay? And the answer is this. If you look at 2020, everyone thought that Biden could not get a nomination, okay? Why? Because he likes charisma. Nobody really likes him, okay? So when Biden goes to speak, there's no one there to listen to him. He's boring and he has no ideas and he's old. I mean, Biden ran for president two times before and he lost both times. And the reason why is he's not charismatic and he has no ideas, okay? But Biden's like, nope, I'm gonna stay in a race because I believe I can win. And you ask him, Biden, what is your strategy? What is your reasoning going forward? I don't know, I'm gonna win, okay? So if we were discussing this in 2020 in May and June, I would be like, Biden has no chance, okay? because Trump's gonna go out there and give speeches to 100,000 people, and they're gonna love him, and they're gonna go and vote for him, okay? Biden gives a speech, everyone falls asleep. And under the debate stage, Trump will destroy Biden, okay? So I was sure that in May, April, 2020, Biden had no chance. But then what happened? Hey, the George Floyd protests happened. So all these young people who didn't really like Biden, they were now galvanized to go vote for him. All these black people, all these sub-urban voters, they wanted Biden to win because they fought Trump with divisive, okay? And then what happened? The pandemic happened, so Trump couldn't go out to debate, Trump couldn't go out to campaign anymore. You understand? Biden could just sit in his basement and do nothing. Right? You understand? So unfortunately, Biden learned the wrong lessons from 2020. The lesson that he learned in 2020 is that, hey, if I just sit in my basement all day and make no mistakes, my surrogates, the Democratic Party, will Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, they'll go out and give speeches for me. They'll fire up the base. And I'll win because I'm not Trump. That is the entire Biden strategy. I'm not Trump. The problem with this idea is, OK, in 2020, the American people had four years of Trump, and they know he sucks. The problem now is the American people have seen four years of Biden. And Biden sucks as well. And so it's a question like who sets more? Biden or Trump, okay? So in other words, people are not gonna come out to vote because they think both suck. And which means that the party with a coalition with a base that feels more strongly about the issues is gonna come out to vote, okay? And what we know is that the Republican coalition coalition of world voters, conservatives, Christians, white voters, they feel much more passionately about Trump than the Democratic coalition feels about Biden. Okay? Does that make sense? So unfortunately the answer is that Biden has no strategy going forward because he didn't have a strategy going forward in 2020. And he won in 2020, so why can't the same thing happen in, same thing happened this year, right? And unfortunately, because Biden is so old, he's 81, he doesn't have the energy to change the way he is. You understand? It's much easier for him to sit around and play that I'm not Trump will deliver another election than it is for him to go out and change who we are. He can't change who we are. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay, but that's a great question. All right? Any more questions before? Okay, so again, I am not sure who will win this year, okay? I think it's Trump. I'm not sure that Nikki Haley will be his vice president. I'm just making a guess. So the question then is why are we doing this? And the answer is this. We try to think. We have to build an analytical model, right? of how the world works. And the only way we know if this model works or not is by making predictions and testing it against reality. So you know what? It's possible that in August, Trump will pick someone else, possibly someone named JD Vance. The only thing you need to know about JD Vance is he's very loyal to Trump. It's possible he picks JD Vance. I think he'll pick Nikki Haley. I often actually, I often think that there's a very good chance he picks JD Vance as well, okay? But I'll make the bet that he picks Nikki Haley. Okay, so it's possible in August he does not pick a Nikki Haley picks JD Vance or someone else instead, okay? It's also possible that in November Trump loses, okay? Well, that's fine because if I'm wrong, then what I do is I go back to this analysis And I make changes to this analysis so that it's much more reflective and accurate. Does that make sense? And that's how we try to think critically about the world. By building analytical models that we can then test against reality. And then based on what happens in reality, we can go and refine our analytical model. Any questions? So next week, we discuss the war in Iran. Because if you look at this, again, if Nikki Haley becomes the vice president, it is very likely she will agitate for war against Iran. And Trump will go along. And if that's the case, then we need to understand how America will fight the war and how Iran will respond. And that's what we will do next week. OK?"}

Let us review last class, where we discussed the father-son dynamic between Puppa II and his son, Xander. We said that the father, he is the founder and the builder of a great organization. And as such, he will have three particular characteristics unique to him. First of all, he will exercise really good judgment because he's starting with nothing and he has to build up slowly his nation or his organization. Okay? Second thing that we said is he will promote talent. Okay? He will be a very generous and fair-minded individual who will actively spot talent and create a meritocracy. Okay? And the third thing we said was this person will be selfless, extremely disciplined, and this person will put the greater good before his or her own interests. And that will inspire loyalty from his or her workers or soldiers. We also said the sun will be very different because the sun is inheriting this enterprise or this nation. The sun will focus on expansion. The sun will be a very aggressive risk-taker, okay? Second characteristic of the sun is Because he is under the father's shadow. He will promote obedience and loyalty promote loyalty and Final characteristic the final contrast between the father and son is the sun will be very selfish because the sun will be focused on personal glory. The reason why is the sun is insecure, right? The sun will hear people in the background of shadows whispering, oh, Evan, you've achieved, it's because you're a father. And so the sun is desperate, very anxious to prove his own self-worth, okay? So we see this dynamic in literature and in history, in our own lives, right? This is very common dynamic. Now, we said that this is really a thought experiment. But if you think about it, this is also a analytical model. It's a way to understand the world around us. And in an integral model, we have to test which true or not. And if it's true, it does two things. First thing it does is it explains. Does it help us understand, better understand the motivations and behavior of people around us? In last class, we focused on for the second, and that really helped us understand his motivations and behavior. Today, but the second thing it must do is predict. It has to predict the future. If this analytical model that we have is correct, then it will allow us to predict future events and behavior. And that's what I propose today. I propose to use this model to predict the life of the academic grade. So from this model, we can extrapolate three characteristics of Alexander's reign when he takes over as king. What's the first characteristic of Alexander when he becomes king? Echo, do you have any ideas of what he will do as king? Exactly. So the first thing we will say is that he will focus on expansion. He'll be a very aggressive risk taker. He will take risks that are not strategically wise. That's the first prediction we can make about him. What's the second prediction we can make about him? Based on this. Exactly, we call this a tyrant. He's become a tyrant. A tyrant is someone who demands obedience from everyone. Does that make sense? And so if he's a tyrant, what is he gonna do to all these tyrant people that his father promoted? He's gonna kill them, right? Okay, he's gonna get rid of them because he needs to promote his own people and because these tyrant people will counter his tyranny, okay? So we predict he will demand complete and total obedience from his followers, okay? And what's the third prediction we can make about him? So the third prediction is that he, the question is, will he ever be happy? When will he stop his ambition? Never, okay? So his ambition is boundless. So these are the three predictions we can make about Alexander if he were to become king, just based on our understanding of the father-son dynamic. The first is that he will focus on aggressive expansion. He will take risks that his father will not take. Okay, that's the first thing. Second thing is, he's gonna become a tyrant who will demand total loyalty and obedience from his followers. And if you, for his own good, speak up and try to reason with him, he will see you as a threat, as this loyal, and as an enemy who must be eliminated. Okay? The third prediction we can make is, his ambition is boundless. he will never stop expanding. He will never stop going to war. Okay, these are three predictions we can make based on this Anacomodal, okay? And it turns out these three predictions basically capture the essence of X and Y's life, okay? All right? So now I will solely explain the life and times of X and Y's great. All right. So any questions so far? So we are using this analytical model to understand the life and times of X and the grade. And while we're doing this, we're trying to see if there are problems with this model. So we have to take a very skeptical attitude. We have this prediction model. We're going to apply it to X and the grade. And we're going to see that on a surface, it does actually capture well, or explains well, his life. At the same time, we want to be generous and skeptical. We want to ask ourselves, is it possible that we are reminded by our prejudice? And maybe we are being unfair to Alexander the Great. Does that make sense? So let's start with the first major event in Alexander the Great's life, which the death of his father in 33C BCE. And that's under right now, he's only 20. And when his father dies, he is automatically coordinated as king of the kingdom of Massilon. Now I want to explain the circumstances of Philip's death because it's very important for us to understand the sort of psychology of his son. So two years before his death, Philip actually remarried. Now, remember that Macedon is a society that promotes polygamy. So Philip at this point already has six or seven wives. The problem is that only one of his wives, named Olympias, has given birth to a son and therefore a here. The son is Alexander. The other wives have failed to give birth to a here. And it seems Alexander will be anointed king at the death of his father. So when Philip Marry's, her name is Cleopatra Uredici, it's extremely controversial. Okay, and it disrupts the political order of Macedonia. The first reason is Cleopatra Uredici, she is actually Macedonian, before Philip married foreign wives for diplomacy reasons. And what this means is if Cleopatra UEDC gives birth to a son, this son will be more legitimate, I'll be more legitimate here than Alexander. And this pushes Alexander out of the line of succession. Okay? So this is extremely controversial. It's like dynamite almost. Okay? So that's the first problem. Second problem is UEDC is the wife of one of the great generals at the atlas. And actually at the wedding ceremony between URDC and Philip, atlas gave a toast. He said, here's a toast. And I pray that Nassau Dawn will soon have a legitimate heir. And this is direct insult to Alexander. The other problem is that atlas, his father-in-law is Parminion, who is really Philip's partner. The greatest general that Macedonia has, the person in control of the army. So it seems like Alexander is being pushed out of the land of succession. And Alexander and his mother, Olympias, are both freaking out. So in 336 BCE, Philip is assassinated by his bodyguards. guard. And no one knows why this happened, okay? But we know what happened. Afterwards, what happened is, first of all, Olympias killed UEDC and her daughter and son. The son was going to be legitimate here to the throne. Now they're all dead. Okay? That's the first that happens. The second thing that happens is Attilus becomes afraid and he's about to rebel. Okay? And Attilus again is a general. At this stage, at this point, Parmonion is now the kingmaker, right? Because Parmonion is now head of the army. He can choose to support Attilus, his son-in-law, and rebel, okay, and maybe become king himself, or he can support Alexander, And at this point, the faithful decision that Parmigian makes is he supports Alexander and he kills Attilaus. And Attilaus again, he's his son-in-law. And this makes Alexander now the legitimate heir to Fulow. He's now king of Asimov. So from this event, we can surmise some things. The first thing we can surmise is Olympias and Axanth are extremely ambitious. They will not be pushed aside. If they see any risk to their power, they will act viciously. They're not afraid to kill. They will even kill the king in order to assure their power. That's the first thing. The second thing that's more important for us is, Parmoneon is absolutely loyal to Alexander, because if you think about it, he's loyal to the memory of Philip. Philip promoted Parmoneon to be his partner, and in a show of loyalty and gratitude, Parmoneon now is being loyal to the son, Alexander. So that's the first major event in Alexander's life. Any questions about this event before I move on? Okay, so the second thing that happens is, remember like Philip is now in charge of this white kingdom across Greece. And when people hear about his death, people start to rebel, okay? The Athenians want to rebel, the Thebans want to rebel, the Spartans want to rebel. And then to the north, the Illyrians rebel. So there are these rebellions. The first thing that Alexander does is he mounts this extremely fast and decisive campaign to quell all eternal dissent. Because ultimately his ambition is to complete the dream of his father, the conquest of Persia. So he goes to Illyria, which is in north, which is north to Macedonia, and destroys all opposition. Next thing he does is he marches against Greece itself, against Thebes. And Thebes is the main source of opposition. And Sparta and Athens both promised to send troops to support Thebes. The problem is Alexander gets there really fast. And he lays siege to Thebes and destroys it completely. The next thing that he does is he decides to massacre all the males and enslave all the women. Now, this is actually common practice back then, in terms of warfare, but this is not done to Greek cities. Do you understand? The Greeks consider themselves special. And so in 404 BCE, when Sparta defeated Athens in the Peloponnesian War, remember that Sparta did not do anything. Sparta just basically said, guys, will you promise not to bother us again? Athens as we promised, that was it. So what Aksender Gray did, destroying thief, which is one of the great cultural centers of the Greek world, that was like basically setting off a nuclear bomb. And from then on, the Greeks were committed to overflowing Alexander when the opportunity arose. At the same time, Alexander, by doing this, by showing his ruthlessness, he was able to for now pacify all discontent. People are now afraid of him, and that's what Alexander wants, he wants fear. Okay, so now that eternal descent has been pacified, now that his leadership has been legitimized, he will now embark on the massive invasion of Persia. Now, originally his father, Philip II, his dream was a unified Greek world, okay? What we call Hellenistic, okay? Or the Hellenic world. Because remember at this point, these Greek polishes spread all across the Aegean and the Mediterranean, okay? In North Africa, in Italy, in Asia Minor, in Anatolia, okay? And Philip's vision was to unify all these places. But as in the great, his vision was actually to conquer Persia. So he's expanding his father's vision. So he's lending, he lends in Anatolia, which is like modern day Turkey, with this massive invasion force. And he's going against the Persian Empire. The way that the Persian Empire is designed is, it's not really an empire, it's more like a confederation or alliance. So the provincial governors, who we call the Satraps, they're the ones responsible for defending their own territory. And at this point, the king of Persia, his name is Deris III, he's not really bothered by Alexander. He doesn't realize that Alexander will pose a threat to his rule. He just thinks this guy, he's like 20 years old, he's an upstart. doesn't really matter. So Darius doesn't really bother himself, okay? But he sends an advisor. This guy, he's a Greek, Menon of Rhodes. So he's Greek and he understands Greek warfare. And so they have this war council between the Satraps, the local governors, and Menon of Rhodes. And what Menon of Rhodes proposes is the safest strategy to defeat Alexander, which is basically what we call a war of attrition. The idea is they will not encounter, not fight, Alexander on the battlefield. Because Alexander right now possesses the greatest army in the world, right? Let's not fight him. We will burn all the crops and starve his troops. At the same time, what we will do is, we will bribe Athens and Sparta to rebel against Alexander. And once he's overextended, he has no choice but to go home, okay? The war's over, doesn't cost us anything. The satchups refuse this plan because it would mean destroying their own property. So satchups are like, no, we can overwhelm. So the Battle of Gwynethicus in 334 BCE, X-Enders forces destroy the Persians. This is the first major battle of this war. There'll be three major battles. What's important for us is during this battle, Alexander displayed tremendous recklessness. He rushed to the front of the battle. He led his cavalry, and he was almost overwhelmed. One of the Satyraps knocked him down, and one of the Satyraps was about to kill him, slash him. But then at the last minute, a man named Klytus Black Klytus the Black comes running in, and he cuts off the satchel's arm, thus saving Alexander's life. So at this point, there are two individuals that Alexander should be most grateful for. Parmonion, who basically, he was a keymaker, and he announced that the army would be always loyal to Alexander. And Platus of Black, who saved Alexander's life in battle. And both these men were individuals promoted heavily by his father for their talent. So basically, it was his father's man that saved Alexander. So you would think Alexander would be very grateful to these men. Unfortunately, he would end up killing both men. And this would forever change the course of his life. All right. So after the Battle of Granada, Menon Rhodes was given complete freedom to do what he wanted. So Menon Rhodes tried to stop Alexander. And when he realized he couldn't do it because Alexander's army was too powerful, Menon Rhodes set sail for Greece. He was hoping to bribe Athens and Sparta to join the war and rebel against Alexander. And here, something that happened. And Alexander gets really lucky, okay? And we will find this in his life. He gets very lucky a lot of times. And what is it that happens when men on roads set sail for Greece? About to, and he's about to unite the Greeks and rebel against Alexander. And remember, Athens and Sparta at this point really hates Alexander. So what happens? He dies, okay? He gets sick and he dies. And when men on roads dies, there's no more contact with the Greek world. And now Persia is left to basically defend itself. The Greeks cannot be counted on. There will be Greek rebellions against Exander, but they will be sporadic and they will not be cornered, okay? So, there is no choice but to confront Exander in two massive battles. So the first massive battle is in southern Turkey and Anatolia called the Battle of Isis in 333 BCE. The second battle will happen two years later in Guacamola, in Mesopotamia. And both of these battles are about the same, okay? So I will explain what happened in both battles. So you're gonna stand at center strategy of war. All right, so usually in battles, there are three major forces. There's something called the left flank, okay? The center flank and the right flank. And both armies are like this. Now in both battles, the Persians heavily outnumbered the Greeks, two to one. So it's a massive difference. And the cavalry is usually on the sides. Now there are some certain differences. The first difference is the Persians have one leader, Darius. And he's in the center, being protected by his bodyguard called Immortals. The Immortals are the best troops of the Persians. The Macedonians have two leaders, Parmonion and Alexander. Alexander is in charge of the cavalry, Parmonion is in charge of the infantry, what we call the phalanx. And in both battles, the same thing happens, which is on the left side, Geras commits most of his forces against Parmonion. Okay, so Parmonion is being overwhelmed by superior numbers. But here, the discipline of Parmoneon is just incredible because even though they're being overwhelmed, they're being outnumbered and they're about to be outrun, they hold their ground. And then in the right, in the center, there's so much conflict that eventually what happens is there's a small gap that allows Alexander to rush to Darius. Remember, Darius is being protected heavily because he's the king. And at this point, Alexander and his forces are overwhelming the cavalry of Darius. And they're about to close up. They're getting close to Darius. And at this point, what Darius does, and this is something you can never do in a battle. What does Darius do now? And he does this in both battles, ISIS and Gorgomorla. What does he do now? He sees Alexander closing in, right? But his left flank is about to overwhelm Parmonia. What does Sirius do now in both battles? He runs away. When he does that, Alexander is now free to go back and rescue Parmoneon and then the person's flee. Does that make sense? So this is what happens in both battles, Isis and Guacamola. So now that you have the basic overview of both battles, let's analyze this to ask ourselves how great a commander is Alexander. And I want to make you, again, make the argument that he's actually not a great strategist. He's a great soldier. He's very brave, but he's not a great strategist, not like his father. The first thing I will say is this. When military historians look at battles, they look at the wrong things. So they're usually looking at manpower, technology, and resources, or we'll call wealth. And if we look at battles from this land, right, manpower, technology, and resources well, then we can argue the Persians were heavily favored in this battle, in this war, right? We can say that. But I think this is the wrong way to look at military strategy. I think if you really want to understand who's a favorite and who's the underdog, you have to look at three different things. These three different things are cohesion. The idea of cohesion is unity, right? Are these soldiers loyal to each other? Are they friends with each other? Okay? Second thing you wanna look at is discipline. How well trained are these troops? Okay? The third thing you wanna look at is the idea of devotion. Devotion just means how loyal are they to their leaders? How much purpose do they have in the battle? Okay, does that make sense? And what I want to show you today is, look at these three things. They give you a much better overview or analysis of who the better military is. So if you look at manpower technology and resources, then clearly the Persians are the heavy favorites. If you change your frame of reference and you look at cohesion, discipline, and devotion, then the Macedonians are far superior. because look, cohesion means they have a culture, they have a similar culture, right? They're all Greeks. Whereas the Persians are a multicultural empire that they don't mean to be the same language, which means that all these different units that Darius has, they're basically fighting by themselves. So they're not coordinated, okay? Does that make sense? That's the first thing. Second thing is the idea of discipline. If you're an empire, the problem with an empire is your soldiers don't fight that many battles, right? Because you're an empire. No one's gonna challenge you. So these soldiers, even though they have these very expensive armor and horses, they weren't disciplined. They didn't have experience in battle. Whereas Afghanistan's army, it's Philip's army, and for the past 30 years, all they did was fight battle after battle against the Greeks, okay? So in terms of discipline, the Greeks are far superior. And then you look at the devotion. Darius is king, why are people loyal to him? Because he pays them, right? It's profit, it's interest. Whereas the soldiers under Pomeranian Alexander, they love their leaders, right? Their leaders have taken them to victory, to lots of victories. So they're very loyal to him, okay? So just in terms of these, If you just look at cohesion, discipline, and devotion, we can predict that Alexander's army would win, regardless of the strategy. And now you can also make the argument that the strategy that Alexander employed, we will confront the Persians head on. Philip would have thought this was a stupid idea. Because first of all, you're outnumbered. Second of all, you're on enemy terrain. You're on enemy terrain. Therefore, they are able to deploy the resources much better than you are. Now, the third problem is this. The third problem is you cannot afford to retreat. Do you understand? There's no place to retreat. If your army ever breaks, if Permanentians gets overwhelmed, then you're all dead. Why take that risk? Also, before full battles, ISIS and Gagamola, theory is watching the grocery of Alexander. Basically, Darius said, I will give you half my empire. That's pretty generous. And Alexander says, no, I need all of it. So historians will tell you that Guacamole is the shows the military prowess of Alexander. And but you analyze it properly, I think, you will see there are lots of problems with Alexander's strategy in both battles. He was taking risks that he shouldn't have. And he sacrificed a lot of men that he didn't really need to sacrifice. For example, it was all about winning the war, right? Personal glory. Whereas Philip was concerned about the safety and well-being of his soldiers. So Philip would not have engaged in such a battle. He would have preferred negotiation. And then over time, slowly overwhelmed Persia. Does that make sense? Any questions so far about this analysis? Yeah, great. Yeah, okay, so great question. So, actually they didn't really trust the Greeks. The Greeks didn't consider the Macedonians part of, they didn't consider the Macedonians Greek, okay? And so when Alexander developed his invasion force of Persia, they weren't that many Greeks actually in it, it was mostly Macedonian, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, but you're right, if given what actually they didn't think, He could not really trust the Greeks anymore. He couldn't really trust the Greeks like switch sides. And also, there were a lot of Greek mercenaries fighting for Darius in this battle. Men on a roll was Greek. And he sort of knew the Greeks really didn't like Afghanistan. That's right. That's right. That's right. But again, we see this throughout history where a terrible army, because of cohesion, discipline, and devotion, they're basically able to conquer the world, right? So you look at Genghis Khan. Yeah. Yeah. So you look at Mohammed. You look at Genghis Khan, right? And you look at Tamerland, you look at a lot of people, right? They were all tribal armies. But because they had cohesion, discipline, and devotion, they were able to basically conquer most of the world before they themselves devolved into civil war. So does that make sense? Any more questions before I continue? So while Alexander was campaigning against Persia, He was doing things that sort of annoyed his soldiers. So for example, he conquered Egypt without much resistance. So we went to Egypt. And basically, the Egyptians hated the Persians. For decades, for centuries, the Egyptians were trying to rebel against Persia without success. So when Alexander came, they saw him as a liberator. So Egypt fell without resistance. The first thing that Alexander does is he takes a trip into the desert. He disappears for weeks. He goes to a place called the Temple of Zeus Amon. Amon is the highest Egyptian God and Zeus is the highest Greek God. So there are like a synthesis, okay? So this is the highest God in the world. And this is found in the, I said Oasis. And actually it goes to this Oasis in order to seek counsel. He wants to see his future. And when he's at the temple of Zeus, Amon, he's told that Philip is not really his father. Philip is not really his father. Actually, his true father is, take a while, guess, who the true father is. Zeus, Amon, right? Alexander is the first son of God, right? He's the son of God. He's like Heracles and Dionysus. He's actually the son of God. And so when Alexander returns to his soldiers after this revelation, he expects his soldiers to acknowledge this fact, okay? So one thing is in the Macedonian army there's a lot of equality between soldiers and officers, so if you're a soldier, you are allowed to speak your mind. But now, Alexander demands, If you come into his presence, you must first kiss his feet, which is the Persian custom. You must first kiss the feet of your king. And the Macedonians, of course, didn't really like this. So now there's growing concern about the tyranny of Alexander. People like Parmonion and Kledis of Black, who were promoted heavily by his father, are kind of annoyed. Basically, Alexander renounced his father. Phillips is not really my father. I'm really the son of a god. Zeus, Amon. So now there's going discontent among his soldiers. Does that make sense so far? And any questions before I move on? It's just clear to you. So in 331 BCE, Gokomola, the Battle of Gokomola happens and Alexander wins this incredible victory against the Persian king Darius. Darius runs away, but then he's eventually killed by one of his generals, okay? And the Persian Empire now is basically conquered. There's no resistance against Alexander anymore. There's some resistance, but not organized resistance, okay? And at this point, Alexander starts being a tyrant, okay? So the first major sign that he's changing is is in 33O BCE, Parmonian is killed. Remember, Parmonian, you can argue, was the man responsible for all of Alexander's victories, right? Because Parmonian is the one who's doing all the heavy lifting. He's been overwhelmed by most of Persian forces. He stands his ground, which allows Alexander to claim his victory, okay? In 33O BCE, Alexander orders Parmonian to be killed. And there's a lot of controversy around what happened. So I will just basically tell you the basic facts, and then we'll analyze what happened. So there's a lot of resentment against Xander in the army. And now and then there are these conspiracies. They don't go anywhere. But there are these conspiracies amongst officers to assassinate Xander. And one of these conspiracies is found out And one of the officers who finds out about this conspiracy goes to Permanent Son and tells the son, hey, go tell the king. People are trying to assassinate him. The son, Permanent Son, he doesn't think this is a big deal. And he's kind of drunk. So he forgets to tell Alexander. The plot is uncovered and the son, Philip Lytus, Philip Lytus, he's implicated and he's tortured. He had nothing to do with assassination but he's implicated because he didn't tell Xander. While he's being tortured, he also confesses to his father being part of the plot even though there's no evidence implicating his father. In fact, you can make the argument that his father is completely loyal to Alexander. And so just based on this, a forced confession under torture, which is completely unreliable, Alexander and the army decide to have Permanent killed. So an assassin is sent and Permanent is killed. Now, these are the basic facts, and there's no argument about what happened. So the most generous argument, the most generous interpretation is, Abzhen didn't want Permanent Kill. He knows Permanent is innocent, but because Abzhen was forced to kill his son, Filetas, Abzhen didn't feel he had a choice in the matter, okay? Because Permanent might want revenge. So to maintain stability and peace within the army, he had to get Permanent Kill, okay? That's the most generous explanation. But there's another explanation that makes more sense, which is, Alexander has always been jealous of Permanonion. Because Permanonion has the most legitimacy in the army. Troops feel more loyal to Permanonion than they do to Exander. They're more experienced with Permanonion than with Exander. And Permanonion was responsible for many great triumphs. So Exander was jealous of Permanonion. Also, there were these new young officers who wanted to climb the ranks. And to do so, they needed to get rid of people like Parmigian, right? So maybe the conspiracy was a fake conspiracy and it was organized by these law officers to implicate philitis, and then in order to get rid of Parmigian, okay? But regardless of how you interpret this, what we do know is after Parmigian was killed, Basically all the shackles, all the restraints on Alexander went away because there's no one in the army who can resist Alexander. There's no one who can basically urge restraint and caution. So the next thing that happens is this. In the year 328, Klaidt is a black is killed. Remember Klaidt is a black is the person who saved Alexander's life at the Battle of Grenakis. But Clemson Black, again, he is a loyal officer promoted by his father. And now Clemson Black has the same authority as Permanent once had. So Clemson Black is now a threat to Alexander. So what Alexander does is he basically orders the Clemson Black to take some soldiers and go off to a faraway place. It's basically exiled. Okay? Alexander is basically exiling him from the main army. And Kledzir Black knows, basically, he's finished. So before Kledzir Black is meant to go into exile, they have a large banquet, okay? And they're all drunk. And Kledzir Black now is angry. And he gets into a vicious argument with Alexander. And Kledzir Black basically says to Alexander, you've betrayed your people, the Macedonians. You've come to Persia, and you could only conquer Persian with our help. And now you're turning into a Persian, okay? You're adopting Persian customs, like forcing officers to kiss your feet. You're promoting Persian officers within your army. Okay, you're turning your back away from the culture that made you great. Then he says something that really pisses Alexander off. What is one thing that you can say to Alexander that would really piss him off? You, in fact, he would wanna kill you now. Heaven that you've achieved Alexander, it's because you're a father. This is not you, okay? This is Congress of Persia, it's not you. It's your father. It's your father who built this amazing army. It's your father who developed this planet, the Conqueror of Persia, okay? I was gonna get so angry that he's about to lunge at Titus of Black, okay? But before he can do so, his bodyguard surrounds him and stops him and they pull away his sword. And so this makes us think he's been doing this a lot. Okay. Alexander the great gets drunk a lot and kills a lot of people basically. And then Clemson Black, he's taking it out of the room. But Clemson Black is so strong he forces himself back in the room. He starts to continue arguing against Alexander. Alexander then goes and takes a spear and throws it at Clemson Black, killing him on the spot. So Clemson Black is now dead. The two men who are most responsible for Alexander's victories in Persia are now both dead. And he's becoming more and more of a tyrant. Soon afterwards, there's a conspiracy, there's a real conspiracy to kill him. What happens is this, the king, Alexander, goes on a forehunt with his pages, his servants. Now the custom in Persia is the king has to write to the first kill. But these pages are Macedonian, so they don't know this. So one of the pages is the first to kill the boar. Axander is so angry he beats a crap out of this page. The pages get together that night and they resolve to kill this tyrant. And they organize a schedule so that on one night, they would be all in the bedroom looking after Alexander while he sleeps. And then, of course, they would take out their bags and stab Alexander to death. Okay? That's the plan. But what happens is that night they were supposed to do this act, Alexander goes out drinking. He gets drunk and he does not come back until the early morning when the pages are gone. Okay? at this point, when the pages gets nervous and tells Xander about the conspiracy, and Xander has everyone killed, okay? But during the trial, the pages accuse Xander of being a tyrant. Does that make sense? Then what happens is in 326 BCE, after Xander has conquered all Persia, he decides to take his army to India, okay? Now his army is not happy about this because, There are lots of good reasons to invade Persia. The first reason is Persia is very wealthy. Second reason is Persia invaded Greece. So Persia was always a threat to the Greek mainland. The third reason is there are lots of people who suspect it was the Persians who killed Philip. So there are lots of good reasons to invade Persia. There's absolutely no reason to invade India. They've never been to India, They have absolutely no idea what they will find in India. It's a different geography, okay? But Alexander forces his army to invade India, and basically modern day Pakistan. And there they win these victories, but the soldiers are really pissed off because they're far away from home. They have absolutely no idea when this war will end and the weather in India really sucks, okay? So they basically mutiny, they refuse to fight. And Alexander at this point has no choice but to give in to the, but to retreat, okay? To return back to Babylon. But he has two things to show his anger. The first thing he does is he kills all the leaders of the mutiny, okay? Those who spoke up on behalf of their fellow soldiers were all killed one by one. So the only thing that happens is rather than taking soldiers back the original way, Alexander made them march through a desert which killed many of them. Many died because of dehydration and starvation. It was a brutal march across the desert. So, Alexander takes his army back to Babylon. And at this point, Alexander decides he can't invade India, so he'll go invade Arabia. Okay, he'll go invade Arabia, which is desert. There's a reason why no one invaded Arabia, and the reason why it's all desert. There's no reason to invade Arabia. But Alexander wants to be the first to conquer Arabia because his ambition is boundless. He has to prove he's the greatest conqueror in the world. The only way we can do that is by conquering the entire world. He's very suspicious of his own soldiers because they mutiny against him in India. So he's starting to replace his army with Persians, who are much more obedient. He wants obedience. Then something else happens. Back in Macedonia, the general in charge and interpreter, who again is one of Philip's most loyal generals, he gets an argument with Olympias. Olympias answers his mother and interpreter, Dongxi, I.I. And Olympias tells Alexander, and Alexander invites and Temperter to Babylon where they will settle matters. And then Temperter knows what happened to Parmania. He knows what happened to Clemens of Black. And at this point, most of Alexander's generals are unhappy the fact that the army is being Persianized. They're being replaced by Persian officers who are more loyal to Alexander. So in 323, Alexander dies. And again, no one will ever know what actually happened. But the theory is this, OK? I think the theory that makes the most sense is basically the top echelon of the Macedonian army, and Temperter and the other generals, basically decided Alexander has to go, because he's a tyrant. And eventually, he's going to kill everyone, OK? So what happened was there was a banquet, And the temperature of the sun is sun. He's the cup bearer to Alexander, the person who pours the drinks to Alexander during meals. The sun puts poison in the cup. Alexander drinks from it, and he starts to vomit. So Alexander leaves the room to vomit. And then the sun, at temperature of the sun, brings a feather, laced with more poison, to help Alexander vomit some more. And so Alexander should have died on the spot. But Alexander is so tough, he's such a strong man that he lasts for a few more weeks, okay? And he dies in bed. So Alexander now is dead, okay? Okay, this is important because even though he's dead, in the 10 years that he's been around, he's been able to conquer most of the world, which includes Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, okay? He's able to conquer most of the known world. And this goes to problem for the generals who succeed him. Right? Because once you conquer most of this world, and remember, the plan was not to conquer most of the world. It was just Alexander's balanced ambition that made them do so. OK? Another question is, how do you govern? And so because of this pressure, They have no choice but to develop something called Greek culture and spread it in order to create legitimacy for themselves. Okay, and this is something that we'll talk about next class, which we'll conclude our section on the Greeks, okay? The legacy of Alexander. He's conquered the world and now his generals must govern it. And to govern it, they must use something called Greek culture. So they must invent Greek culture and then spread it around the world. And when they do so, what will happen is, The Greek culture will merge with local cultures to create new ideas, okay? Greek culture, one of these cultures that Greek culture will merge with is called Judaism. Judaism. And when these two cultures merge, a new idea will emerge from this mixture called Christianity that changes the world forever, okay? That's why Christians love examines are great because they feel that without his conquest, Christianity could not have been born. So there are many Christians who feel like, as in the great, yeah, he was a tyrant, but he was part of God's plan. He was all part of a plan. He did what he did because he truly is the son of Zeus Amon. And Zeus Amon commanded him to conquer the world. But again, that is a Christian perspective. All right, so that is it. So let's review what we did today. We basically looked at this analytical model. We made three predictions about Alexander based on this analytical model. The first is that he would focus on expansion. Second is he would become a tyrant. The third is that he would never stop expanding. And it turns out he was exactly like this. But this explains, this predicts, his life in times. So, any questions? Okay, so next class, what we will do is we will look at the spreading of Greek culture and the building of the Hellenistic world, okay? And that will end our section on the Greeks."}

So last class, we talked about essential paradox in Christianity. What Jesus believes is different from what Christianity teaches us about Jesus. Okay, so let's go over, let's review what Jesus believes, what he teaches, and what Christianity teaches us about Jesus. Okay, so Jesus. Remember that Jesus is one of our great spiritual leaders and geniuses like the Buddha. And there's a three-tire approach to his religion or philosophy. There's an inner approach, which is a secret teachings, his secret understanding of the world. There's an inner layer, which is what he teaches his disciples. And then there's a public leader which is what he tells other people in public. In the public leader we know very well. He believes in generosity, in mercy, in focusing on being a good and kind person. The inner leader, we also know very well, he demands that the people follow him, give of all worldly possessions and pursuits. If you're rich, if you want to follow him, then you must abandon all your wealth. And he demands self-sacrifice from all his apostles. And then there's a secret layer, which is the philosophy that underpins all these religious teachings. And the secret is that this world we live in is false. And what's really true is the divine spark within us that allows us to connect to the true reality of the monad or the one. The world that we live in is being controlled by a monster. And that's why you should not hate the rich. You should pity the rich. Because the rich are pursuing what is false. And in the pursuit of what is false, it is causing them to feel anger and self-hatred. So Jesus has this great metaphor. And what he says is that the pursuit of wealth is like drinking salt water, okay? The more you drink, the more thirsty you become. And you feel it's because you have not drunk enough. So you drink more and more salt water and eventually you will poison yourself. So that's how he feels about the pursuit of wealth. It is poisonous. It will only lead to your ultimate demise. And that's why it's important to focus instead on our humanity, on our connection with others. That's why it's important to be compassionate. And you should be most compassionate towards the rich because you're the ones who are most guided, the ones who are most misguided and deluded. So that's the Jesus. And again, his teachings are no different from, say, Buddhist teachings or Hindu teachings or Zoroastrian teachings. So all these major religions are aligned in this belief. But then you have the Bible, the Jesus of the Bible. And the Jesus of the Bible is portrayed very differently. In the Bible, Jesus is the Son of God. And there's a conflict between God and humanity. Remember, we humans committed the original sin. We disobeyed him and ate from the fruit of the tree of knowledge and good and evil. And therefore, God banished us from paradise. And ever since, we've been living in misery. God expects us to acknowledge our failings and ask for forgiveness. But because we are ignorant and misguided and sinful, we refuse to apologize. Therefore, Jesus has to return, has to come to earth, and sacrifice himself in the crucification, has to crucify himself in order to atone for sins, and to wash us of our past sins so that we can begin anew. And after he has completed the sacrifice, he has become resurrected. And he now ascends to heaven and he prepares for the day when he will return and destroy all evil and build an eternal paradise on earth. And this is what is known as the second coming. And this is an extremely powerful story, but it's also very complicated and in many ways contradictory. So if Jesus is a son of God, then what is God's role in this? And how does a son of God, a God, actually die on earth? And why does he have to die first before he can return again? So there are a lot of contradictions in this story that you don't have in the first Jesus teachings. So the question I want to ask today is, well how did we get from here, okay, Jesus teaching us about the kingdom of God, that the kingdom of God is within us and accessible to all who are willing to do good, to this idea which demands that we believe that Jesus is a son of God who came to sacrifice himself to redeem us from our sins. And he will eventually return to bring eternal paradise to earth. All right? These are two very different worldviews. So how do we get from here to here? OK. So a lot of the clue lies in the Bible and the story of Jesus in the Bible. So what's interesting about the Jesus story is Jesus gets into trouble when he goes into Jerusalem. Before he was in the provinces, and he was burning a large following. He was healing people. He was spreading the kingdom of God message. And he was very popular. And he was very safe. But then he went into Jerusalem, and he ran afoul of the religious elite in Jerusalem, the high priest. And eventually they rallied the Jewish people against Jesus and they persecuted him. Okay? And eventually Jesus was betrayed by name, named Judas Ascariot, one of his followers. And the Jews brought Jesus before Pontus Pilate, the woman governor of Judea. And at first Pontus Pilate refused to punish him but the Jews insisted. So Pontus Pilate had to eventually crucify Jesus in order to satisfy the will of the Jewish people. Now, this story is constructed in a way that's very, very clever in history who was also persecuted by his own people, which causes death. You guys remember? Which truth teller? Exactly, socrates. So this story reminds us of Socrates, persecution of a truth teller, that's Socrates, right? That reminds of Socrates. Now, let me ask you another question. Who else was betrayed by his own followers? Julius Caesar, right? You see how clever this is? The two most famous individuals in world history at this point, Socrates and Julius Caesar, are brought into the story of Jesus so that it conflates all three together. Jesus, Isacretes, is Julius Caesar. All right? That's very, very clever. And you can only do this if you have a very nuanced understanding of Greek history, Roman history, and the Jewish Bible, the Hebrew Bible. Right? And in fact, at this time, there are individuals who possess all three sets of knowledge. And they are called Hellenized Jews in the Roman Empire. If you are a Hellenized Jew, meaning you grew up with a great education in your Roman Empire, you have access to all three major sets of knowledge. The Hebrew Bible, Greek philosophy, and Roman history. And the major individual in the Bible, who is a Hellenized Jew in the Roman Empire, his name Paul. And he is credited with most of the writing of the New Testament. About a third of the New Testament, which is the Christian Bible, either is written by Paul or it's about Paul. So that's why we believe that not Jesus but Paul is the real founder of Christianity. Christianity again is not by Jesus, It's not a religion by Jesus. It's a religion about Jesus. And there's a difference. OK, now let's talk about the life and times of Paul. Because it's a very interesting story. And again, everything I'm telling you comes from the Bible, a book called Acts of the Apostles, which is about what happens after Jesus dies. So after Jesus dies, this brother, James the Just, becomes leader of his movement. And they're often called the poor. They're often called the poor. Why? Because they're focused on a life that denies worldly goods. They believe this material reality, we live in, it's evil. And we have to focus on the spiritual life. And that's why they demand poverty. That's why they themselves are poor. The demand everyone who believes in them are also poor. And the word for them is called Ibn-i-Az. And this is important because the Ibn-i-Az will eventually leave Jerusalem where they are now and go to Arabia where they will help down the religion of Islam. So I want you guys to keep this in mind. So James the just and his followers, they're in Jerusalem. And what this tells us is if they're in Jerusalem And they're not from Jerusalem. Then they are being protected and honored by the Jewish elite. And this, again, is evidence that it was not the Jews who killed Jesus. It was the Romans who killed Jesus. Because if the Jews killed Jesus and all his followers, we'd have to leave Jerusalem, right? But after his death, they're all in Jerusalem, basically. So this is a major contradiction in the Bible. Let's talk about Paul. Who is Paul? We actually know very little about the early life of Paul. We know that he's from a place called Tarsus, which is part of the Jewish vascular. He himself is Jewish. He's a Roman citizen. And that's pretty rare for a Jewish person. And you only get citizenship by doing three things. The first thing is you're born of citizens, which is part of the case with Paul. He tells us in the Bible, I'm born a Roman citizen. Therefore, my parents are citizens, which means his parents were very wealthy and part of the Roman elite, okay? Second thing, the second way you get citizenship is by being a soldier for 20 years. And the third way is through service to the emperor. The emperor honors you with citizenship if you have shown devotion and service, okay? So it's very hard to be a Roman citizen, but pause for a Roman citizen. And as a Roman citizen, he grew up secular. He grew up learning Greek rhetoric. He learned socrates, Plato, Homer, all that. For whatever reason, he converts and becomes a Pharisee. Remember, Pharisees are Jewish priests who eventually will become rabbis. And as a Pharisee, he's very fanatical. We know that if you convert, you actually become very fanatical. And as a Pharisee, he was tasked with destroying the Jesus movement. And that kind of makes no sense because we just said that if James suggests and the followers of Jesus are in Jerusalem, that means they are being protected and honored by the Pharisees. So this is actually a major contradiction that no one has actually explained to us. But you'll see a lot of these contradictions in the Bible. OK, anyway, the story continues. He's a Pharisee and he's fanatical about destroying the Jesus movement because it is heresy. It is Jesus thinks of himself as a messiah, and he's not. Eventually, Paul decides to go to Damascus to destroy the Jesus movement in Damascus. But on the road there, he sees the light. He sees the light. And it's Jesus talking to him and saying, Paul, stop persecuting me and my people. And then Paul at this point has something called the Damascus moment. The masses moment is a very famous metaphor in English. It means to see the light and to change your opinion, okay, and to convert into the true belief. And at this point, Paul becomes a fanatical follower of Jesus, even though he's never met Jesus and he's never met the followers of Jesus. This is extremely weird, okay? but he becomes a fanatical follower of Jesus. And he decides he's going to spread the message of Jesus to everyone. And the way you do that is you just go to synagogue and tell Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. And eventually, he will begin to build the structure in the organization of Christianity. Right now, they're not called Christians. They're still Jews. And Jesus and his followers are considered a branch of Judaism, okay? But there's some major differences. The first major difference is Paul believes that Jesus is Messiah. And what's really important is he teaches us that through faith in Jesus, you will achieve salvation. This is very different from what Jesus himself taught. It is through good works that you achieve salvation. But Paul teaches us, nope. It is believed in Jesus as a savior that will offer you salvation. The good works don't matter. It's the belief, the faith in Jesus that matters, okay? That's the first thing. Second thing that Sympathize Paul is, he's focused on organization and structure, okay? Jesus and his followers were very egalitarian. They didn't believe in organization, they didn't believe in hierarchy, they didn't believe in structure. But Paul insists only if you have hierarchy in organization and structure where you have the ability to fully promote Jesus's message to the people. So he's putting churches around the Roman Empire. For Paul, what mattered first and foremost was to convert as many people as possible. because believe in Jesus met salvation. So we have a duty to save as many people as possible. So it's important to make compromises. For example, circumcision. So there were many in the Jewish diaspora around the Roman Empire who weren't circumcised. Why? Because the fathers were Greek and the mothers were Jewish. And Paul felt it was very important to bring these people into the religion. And so he basically said, you know what? If you're 20 years old and you're not circumcised, don't worry about it. What the law doesn't matter. What matters is your faith in Jesus. So these are the three radical changes that Paul makes to the religion that's being developed around Jesus. And as you can imagine, this is pissing off Jewish people, especially back in Jerusalem. So James the Just hears about this from all his Jewish friends and say, this guy Paul grown around the Roman Empire and teaching everyone that it's not important to follow Jewish law and customs. It's not important to be Jewish. What's important is to believe in Jesus. And so James the Just and Paul start to have A major argument. Okay? James suggests it's written in Paul and says, Paul, what's going on? Why are you telling people you'd like to follow Jewish law? And Paul writes back and says, what matters is not the letter of the law, what matters is the spirit of the law. If Jesus has come and he's the savior, then believing in him is what matters. And we need to get as many people to believe in Jesus as possible. Okay? So for example, Gentiles, non-Jews, want to believe in Jesus, but they're 20, they're 30, they're 40. How can they circumcise themselves? I'm just trying to open up the religion. I am the apostle to the Gentiles. So Paul names himself Apostle to the Gentiles, the non-Jews. I am liberating this religion for all. I'm bringing this religion to everyone, Greek and Jew alike, Greek, Roman and Jew alike. Eventually, this conflict becomes so bitter that James suggests spread rumors about Paul, and many of Paul's churches now start to abandon him. Because remember, James suggests it's Jesus's brother. So if there's an authority, it's James suggests, not Paul. And Paul becomes very angry. Paul tries many, many tricks. For example, he tries to bribe James to just by offering him money. He also writes letters complaining about James the judge and saying, well, just because you're a Jesus brother, it doesn't mean you know what he actually says. Because Jesus, talk to me, man! Jesus came to me in a vision. Therefore, I'm the one who really understands Jesus. All right? Eventually, politicized, you know what? This conflict is so bad, everyone's leaving me that I have to go to Jerusalem and sort things out with James. Okay? So he goes to Jerusalem and he meets with James. And at first the meaning goes well. But then in Jerusalem the people who don't like Paul recognize him and they start to mob him. They want to kill this guy. And what's really interesting about how this is written is it's very similar to the Jesus story where Jesus is being mobbed by Jews. And at this point Paul is about to be ripped apart by the Jewish mob. But then Roman soldiers come and save him. And Paul does something that's different from Jesus. Paul tells Roman soldiers, I am a Roman citizen. And the soldiers are like, oh, wow, okay, then we must protect you. We must ensure that you get fair treatment. And so Paul is brought to the Roman governor. And the Roman governor doesn't believe that Paul has broken in laws. But there's a Jewish mob out there who want to kill him. So now Paul says to the governor, let me talk to the Roman emperor. I will make my case before the Roman emperor. And the governor is like, well, then I have no choice. I no longer have the authority to judge you myself. You, as a Roman citizen, have the right to talk to the Roman emperor. So therefore, I will send soldiers with you to Rome to be judged by the Roman emperor himself. And so if you actually read the Bible, these two stories between Jesus and Paul, you will see how many parallels and similarities there are. The difference is this. The difference is Paul is a Roman citizen, Jesus is not. Therefore, Jesus was killed because he was not a Roman citizen. Does that make sense? If Jesus were a Roman citizen, he could preach all he wants. He could say whatever he wants, but he wasn't. And therefore, he was killed. So then Paul goes back to Rome, and this is how the Acts of the Apostles ends. Let's read it together, because the way it is written is extremely fascinating. When we come into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who was guarding him. This makes no sense. Paul is a criminal. The Jews are accusing Paul of viling their laws. Paul has returned to Rome to be judged by the Roman emperor. But this is what the Bible says. Paul was allowed to live by himself. He was being guarded by a soldier who was protecting him. That's a contradiction. What's going on here? But then it gets more interesting. Next paragraph. Three days later, he called together the local leaders of the Jews. What? This makes no sense. The Jews considered him a criminal. Yet, he has the power and authority to call all the major Jewish local leaders of Rome into his house for a meeting. Who gave him this power? From the perspective of Jews, he is a criminal. He's asking people to break the laws of Moses. What's going on here? Then, when they assemble, he said to them, OK? This is him talking to them. Brothers, though had done nothing against our people or the cousins or ancestors. So he's denying any wrongdoing. But he clearly committed it wrong because, circumcision, guys, and we talked about this, circumcision is how Jews know they are the chosen people. There's a covenant between Abraham and Yahweh, God. The covenant is Abraham and his ancestors will circumcise themselves as a mark of allegiance to Yahweh. In return, Yahweh will give them a promised land. So circumcision is core to what it means to be Jewish. In fact, it's the main feature of being Jewish. And here Paul tells people, oh, you don't have to circumcise yourself. So he's clearly breaking the customs and laws of their ancestors. He's saying, nope, I didn't do anything wrong. And again, these are Jewish leaders. who know for a fact Paul is guilty of this. But the Jews here don't speak up, and Paul continues, yet I was arrested in Jerusalem and then over the Romans. When they had examined me, the Romans want to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. The Romans wanted to let me go, but the Jews insisted that I be killed. So the Romans were safe. Right? But the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to the emperor. So when the Jews wanted to kill me, I told the governor, listen, there's higher authority than you, and it's the emperor. And I want to go speak to the emperor. The governor had no choice but to send guards, soldiers, to take me to Rome, to be tried by the emperor. And now, this is the most important sentence, even though I had no charge to bring against my nation. What Paul is saying is this. Paul is saying, I could go talk to the emperor, but if I talk to the emperor, then it's because I accuse my people, the Jews, of a crime against a Roman citizen. You understand? So what he's doing, it's very clever, is he's making a real threat to the Jewish leaders of Rome. If you mess with me, I'm no threat to the emperor and accuse you guys of attacking a woman's citizen. Do you understand this? You see how radical this is? This speech is really different from the story before in the Bible. So Paul is accusing the Jews of committing a crime, whereas before the Jews were accusing Paul of committing a crime. And what Paul is saying is, I'm right, because access to the emperor, you don't. And this is how the Bible, this is how the book ends. The Acts of Apostles, this is how it ends. He lived there two whole years at his expense. He's clearly very wealthy, right? Proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and about hindrance. No one can touch this guy. This is how the story of Paul ends. He's in Rome, he can do whatever he wants, and no one can touch him. All right? So who is this guy? How can he do this? He's a Jerusalem. The mob's trying to kill him. The Roman soldiers come and save him. And he goes back to Rome. And he tells the Jewish leaders there, hey, guys, don't mess with me. And they leave him alone. And some even convert. Who is this guy Paul? So that's a question. So any questions so far? So again, there are a lot of questions in the story of Paul that don't make any sense. The first thing that doesn't make sense is like, who is this guy? He has all this power and money, and he can do whatever he wants, and no one can touch him. So that's the first big question. Second big question is, why does he convert? His conversion story doesn't make any sense. We're like, okay, well, because he saw Jesus. Okay, that's fine, but guess what guys? After Jesus talks to him, Jesus sort of disappears from the story. And you would think that if Jesus was so important Paul, Paul would quote from Jesus, right? But he doesn't quote from Jesus. Jesus has a lot of, the message a lot of sayings, but Paul rarely quotes from him. Okay? But knowing that, we already said that the message of Jesus, the message of Paul are very different. Jesus believed the kingdom of God was within us. For our generosity, for our mercy, we can achieve salvation. Paul taught everyone it's believing Jesus that will allow you to achieve salvation and only believe in Jesus. You can do as much good as you want but if you don't believe in Jesus you'll be damned to hell. So all those Buddhists, all those Hindus, all those Zoroastrians who are doing good in the world too bad they will be burned in hell and that goes against a lot of the teachings of Jesus. So he did convert but he's not spreading the gospel of Jesus. Another question then is, why is he focusing on organization? Why is he focusing on organization? The heart of religion is spiritual truth. The Paul doesn't really care about that. He cares about the organization. The church, who's in charge, how many members we're attracting, how we can appeal to them more, how to resolve internal local disputes within the church. That's what he cares about. That's very odd. And then the last question then is why does he get in trouble with the Jews and why did the Romans save him? So these are questions. Now let's first go over the Christian explanation. And the Christian explanation is Paul was part of the divine plan. So Jesus brought truth into the world. The truth of Jesus, that's what Jesus teaches. But it was Paul who created the structure in the organization that allowed Christianity to spread. So an analogy or a comparison is the story of McDonald's. McDonald's. You guys all know McDonald's, right? Well guess what? In 1950s, McDonald's was one restaurant in California. It had amazing hamburgers. And it really had the best hamburgers. And a man named Ray Kroc visited this restaurant and it was being run by the McDonald's That's what it's called McDonald's, okay? When Ray Kroc says to the brothers, you know what, you guys have an amazing restaurant. Let me scale it out. Let me convince others to open McDonald's around America and the world. This is called the franchise model, okay? The franchise model. The franchise model. And so the brother says, yeah, sure. And what Ray Kroc did was he drove everywhere, like Paul. And he had these meetings, like Paul, where he convinced people of the American dream, like Paul. Ray Kroc said to everyone, if you open McDonald's, you will get rich and you will live the American dream. Paul said to everyone, if you believe in Jesus, you will achieve salvation. And because Ray Kroc was such an amazing salesperson, McDonald's eventually became the largest restaurant empire in the world. Same thing with Paul, because Paul was just The convincing salesmen Christianity became the most dominant religion in the world. So this is all part of God's plan. It's very similar to the story of McDonald's. Here's the problem guys. Jesus was not selling hamburgers. In fact, Jesus hated hamburgers. The central message of Jesus is wealth is wrong. Business is wrong. Hierarchy is wrong. What matters is the spiritual truth in your heart. So even though this is the Christian belief that both are part of the divine plan, and Paul was doing, Paul was basically Jesus' business manager, okay? Probably is Jesus didn't want a business manager. And Jesus believed that it was our own individual responsibility to discover our own truths for him, okay? So what are some other explanations for Paul? Okay. Alright, so I mean the most basic answer for people who hate Paul is he was just an opportunist, a charlatan. Okay? He saw it a business opportunity. Everyone loved Jesus. Jesus had gone viral, right? He had gone viral and he was a mean now around the world and so he wanted to take advantage of that. He wanted to monetize that. The problem with this is he worked really hard, man. He traveled around all, he traveled all around the Roman Empire to spread the message. He was fanatical about it, okay? And opportunists are not fanatical. They're kind of lazy. So I don't really buy this idea that he was opportunist. He really believed in what he was doing. He was driven by a sense of mission, okay? And also, guys, remember, if he's a Roman citizen and his parents are Roman citizens, then he's probably wealthy himself. He doesn't really need this money. So what's important to understand is Paul comes from a very well-educated background. He's very wealthy, he speaks Greek, he writes Greek beautifully, he's classily educated. He doesn't want to deal with James the Just who is not well-educated. He doesn't want to deal with these people. So why is he dealing with these people? So I don't really buy this explanation. The next one is secret conspiracy. The idea here is Paul and maybe many who supported him hated the Roman Empire and they believed Christianity would be a weapon that would eventually destroy the Roman Empire, which is what happened historically. That's 300, 400 years in the future. How could Paul know that? And also, what does Paul have against the Roman Empire? Really, right? He's been a fishery of the Roman Empire. He's wealthy, his parents are wealthy. So, another explanation, which by the way, I've never heard before, but which I do believe. So take this with a grain of salt, but I believe he was a spy for the Roman Empire. He was a spy. So let me explain the idea here. What is he doing? And all right. So the Jews have always been a problem for empires, both the Greek empire and the Roman empire. Why? Because the Greeks and the Romans are pagans. They celebrate pagan gods. But the Jews believe that their God is the only God, and every other God is false. And so they refuse the authority of the empire. And this has led to many wars. From 167 to 167 BCE, there's something called the Maccabees revolt against the solution of the empire. The last seven years killed a lot of people. And then the Romans and the Jews with three major wars from 66 to 73 CE. This is around the time of Paul. The first war will be fought. The Romans will burn the temple down and ban all Jews from Jerusalem. And the Romans think through this aggression that the Jews will be cowed. They'll be scared, right? No, no, no. It makes them even more angry so that two more wars are fought from 115 to 117. And then the third war will be from 132 to 136. So the Jews are fanatical. That's what gives the Jews power. They're a poor province of the Roman Empire, but they're fanatical. And guess what? Romans respect fanaticism. Remember, 216 BCE, Hannibal invades Italy and destroys all the Roman armies who are against him. In the Battle of Cannae, he has killed at least 20% of the Roman adult male population and a third of the Senate. And at this point, the Romans should have surrendered and talk peace, right? The Romans are fanatical. They refuse to surrender and eventually they're able to destroy Carthage. Okay? So now the Romans see the Jews who again, it's a the poor small province in the Roman Empire, and they continue to rebel. So this finacism of the Jews, it both scares and it alls the Romans. They still understand, the Romans above all understand how powerful finacism is. Finacism is the ultimate weapon. It cannot be defeated. And because there's a Jewish diaspora, you can never be rooted out. You can destroy Jerusalem, which is what they did, but they're Jews all around the world. So you can never destroy this finacism. And because of the long history of the Jews, this finacism only grows through persecution and through suffering, okay? So you have to somehow destroy this finacism if you are to win this war against the Jews. And there are three central beliefs underlying this Jewish finacism, all right? The first is the idea of purity. Why is it that if the Jews are God's chosen people, they're always being pushed around by these larger empires, like the Syrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans? And the answer is, because we Jews have not been pure enough. We have not been loyal enough to Yahweh. So it is only through purity that it will allow us to eventually triumph over our enemies, okay? Otherwise, we will continue to be bolded by others. Second is the idea of persecution complex. The persecution complex. The entire world is against us because we are God-showsen people. And therefore, we must stand united and stay pure. Who the Jews really hated were the Jews who assimilated like Paul, right? They hated these people because they were traitors to the nation of Israel. Second belief, and there's a third belief, which is the coming of the Messiah. Don't worry about today, okay? This pain, this suffering, this persecution, it's all part of the divine plan. It's testing us. It is making us strong. Eventually, the Messiah, the Nordic one, will come from heaven and lead us into a final battle against all enemies, the Roman Empire, and we will destroy them. And then we will establish the nation of God, the king of heaven on earth. And so these are the three major beliefs that underpin Jewish finality and it makes the Jews almost invincible because it makes them fearless. They're not afraid to die. Dying is part of the divine plan. Suffering is all part of the process of achieving the kingdom of heaven on earth. It's a responsibility to die for their faith. All right, so now that we understand this Jewish fanatism, we can now understand why Paul is doing what he's doing. Think about this. Purity means absolute obedience to the law of Moses, right? But what Paul is saying is no, guys, circumcision. Circumcision is we don't have to enforce circumcision because we want more non-Jews into our religion. Why is circumcision such a big deal? Well, because circumcision is basically what separates the Jews into a different group of people in any community. Why? Because in most of these, there's a place called a gymnasium. A gymnasium is really the heart and center of life in the community. It's where men go to do sports and athletics like wrestle and run. The thing about the gymnasium is everyone goes in naked. And why is this a problem? Because if you're Jewish, people know right away you're Jewish. Therefore, it's hard for you to go into the gymnasium because you'll be ridiculed by the Greeks. Therefore, there's no way for the Jews to associate with the Greeks and other people. Does that make sense? That's why circumcision is so important. Once you say to the Jewish people, you don't need to be circumcised. You just have to have faith in Jesus. It's easier for them to assimilate into the larger culture around them. Persecution complex. Jews are being persecuted, why? Because they're not Roman citizens. Right? Let's go back to the story of Jesus. Why did he get persecuted? Why did he die? Because he was not a Roman citizen. If he were a Roman citizen, then probably his pilot would have protected him from the Jews who wanted to kill him. Just like how the Roman soldiers protected Paul from those Jews who wanted to kill him. So guys, focus on being a Roman citizen, and you can believe anything you want. You will no longer be persecuted. You'll be part of the Roman Empire. Now, the last thing is they come in with a Messiah. Jews believe the Messiah is going to come and lead them into final victory against all their enemies, especially the Roman Empire. But what Paul is saying is this, that the Messiah has already come. these Jesus. And Jesus taught a message of eternal salvation, internal salvation, to recognize the evil within you and to become a better person. So if you want to be saved, you must believe that we are born evil and Jesus has come to cleanse us of our evil. Jesus was a prophet of peace. He had nothing against the woman empire. He was fighting against evil in the world. So if these three things are true, then fanaticism will be destroyed. Now, obviously, if you're fanatic, you don't believe any of this crap. But Paul's message was not for fanatical Jews. They were still a minority. His message were for diaspora Jews like him who were stuck between the Roman Empire and the Jewish faith. They were part of the Jewish diaspora. Maybe the fathers were Greek and the mothers were Jewish. And these are a lot of people. So Paul's message was for these people, you can still be Jewish if you believe in Jesus. And once you believe in Jesus, then you can now assimilate into the one empire. And this will free you to believe whatever you want. Okay? So, this is Paul's mission. Now, then the question then is, why is Paul doing this? Why would Paul do this? And I think the answer is this. I don't want to say Paul is opportunist or he's evil. I believe he was also a believer in his mission. His mission was what? To save his people. If you want to continue to live with the Roman Empire, you have to adapt yourself. You have to make compromises. You can't wait for the Messiah to come save you. You have to save yourself by adapting to the Roman Empire. And look, there are lots of advantages to the Roman Empire. You can become very happy and prosperous if you've played by the rules of the Roman Empire, like he did. So in many ways, what's odd about Paul is he teaches us that Jesus is the Messiah, But in his heart, and he can tell by his writings, he himself believes he's really the Messiah who has come to save his people. And that's why he's so fanatical about building the church of Christianity. The church that will eventually become Christianity. Okay? Again, at this point in history, they're not Christians. They're still Jews. Okay? But there will be a lot of consequences because Paul is doing this. He radically changes the meaning of faith and religion. Because again, the story of Jesus doesn't really make any sense. And his story doesn't make any sense either. He's lying about who he is. So he creates a new concept. He radically changes the concept of faith. Before, faith is what you experience. Now faith is something that you must believe. He introduces the idea of miracles now. If somebody can explain, it's because it's a miracle. And this is a new idea that really didn't exist before. And the use of miracles is to explain the contradictions or the inconsistencies in the story of the Bible. So that's one major revolution of Paul's teachings. Another is the idea of tradition. Tradition is more important than the Bible. So the stories, interpretation of the Bible is now more important than the Bible itself. And the Paulist church will eventually become the Catholic church. And one thing about the Catholic church is you are not allowed to read the Bible. The Bible is sacred, it's forbidden. Only priests are allowed to read the Bible. Because the fear is if you read the Bible, you might misinterpret the word of God. You don't have the spiritual power in order to fully interpret the Bible properly. So there are lots of major changes to the idea of religion because of Paul's work. All right, so that is my central argument about Paul. Are there any questions about any of this? Yes? Okay, you have a question about Islam? Can we save Islam for later on? Yeah, but I'll answer it when we put Islam, okay? That'll be next week. OK, that's a great question. Like, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles? All right, so we don't know who wrote the Acts of the Apostles. But this is what we do know. Whoever wrote the Acts of the Apostles was written by the guy who wrote Luke, OK? The Gospel of Luke, which is one of the four main gospels of the Bible. Why? because the Acts of Apostles is the continuation of the story of Jesus found in Luke. So every word Luke is also a person who wrote Acts of Apostles. That's the first thing we know. The second thing that we know is the Luke Gospel was written maybe between 80 and 90 C.E. So this is about 50 to 60 years after the death of Jesus. Okay? And Paul might still be alive at this time. What we also know is this actual apostles is very pro-Paul. Okay? So what's important to understand is the story I'm telling you is a story that comes from individuals who are trying to promote a positive picture of Paul. And why are they doing that? Because at this point in history there are a lot of people, especially Jews, who hate Paul, they feel that Paul has corrupted their religion, especially the teachings of Jesus. And I believe at this point in history, because of the way that Paul behaves, it's an open secret that he's working very closely with the Roman Empire. He's either a collaborator or he's a spy. And that's why they have to write the Acts of Apostles, to sort of like apologize So to clean up the image of Paul. And again, we've seen this throughout history, right? Remember, the Bible started out as an apology for King David. So this is extremely sympathetic towards Paul. And again, what I'm showing you is that through a close reading, you can see how problematic it is. So does that answer your question? Any more questions? OK. All right, great. So let's talk about next class. In the next class, we will talk about monotheism, the coming of monotheism, okay? Because this is a revolution in human history and human thought, all right? So there are many scholars who believe that monotheism means believing in one God. What I will show you in the next class is, monotheism is a radical reconception of reality. Okay, and that's what I will teach you next class."}

Now normally Westerners understood this process as one of diffusion, meaning that Greek civilization was the best, and so everyone wanted access to it. So it spread because Greek civilization was the best. Historically, that's not true. What happened was that Greek civilization spread through a process of conquest, primarily by axon of the great. So the question I want to answer today is how did axon of the great conquer the world? Because Exxon the Great himself is not Greek. He's Macedonian. So he's like a close cousin, but he's not considered culturally Greek. He's from a place called Macedon, which is north of Greece. And for most of its history, Macedon, the kingdom of Macedonia, was poor. It was weak. It was divided. So how was it possible that Macedon, the Kingdom of Macedon would conquer the world and not sputter or athens, which for most of Greek history were the dominant powers. Okay, so for me to explain what happened, I need to explain to you two thought experiments, okay? So we're gonna do two thought experiments to develop the integral tools in order to better understand the process of military conquests, okay? So let's do a thought experiment. There's a father and there's a son. Okay? And they're both business people. They start a business. The father starts with nothing and he makes $10 million, okay? Which is a great accomplishment. The son takes his business and expands it, okay? And he shows $10 million, the inheritance, into $10 billion, okay? And this happens a lot. So who is the most more impressive the two? The father or the son? The father is more impressive because he started with nothing, right? It's much harder to build something from nothing than this to expand something, okay? The problem though is that we in society and history in the media, we celebrate the son because $10 billion is a lot of money, okay? Does that make sense? So it's a father who does all the work and builds the organization and the capacity for growth. It's a son who expands it and gets all the credit. And this happens a lot in history. Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna think about the qualities of a father and a son that allow them to succeed. So what can we say about the father? How was he able to build a great business? he is what? And the first thing we can say is he is innovative, right? Meaning he has a new idea that allows him to capture markets, okay? Now, it's possible that he stole the idea, but that also shows that he has wisdom and judgment, right? So he's innovative or he has wisdom and judgment. Okay, doesn't make sense. That's the first major quality of the father. He's very innovative, okay? Or he's wise and has good judgment. Second quality about the father, we can say, is that he's a very effective manager of people, okay? Because remember, he has nothing. So he has to build loyalty among his workers. He has to find workers, he has to recruit workers, and he has to make them work hard for him, right? So what can he do to find good workers and ensure they work hard for him and build a business? Why would you want to go work for someone and work hard for him? Well, they pay you good money, but a lot of people pay you good money. What's different about this business? Good, okay, so the vision, right? Or the dream. So the business has a vision and a dream that compels you. You see the potential for growth. So not only is the father innovative, but he's also a visionary. He's a dreamer. And that's what attracts you to him. The other thing is that he's fair, meaning that he promotes talent. You want to work for someone who will treat you fairly, who will be honest with you. So if you work hard, he'll tell you, while you're working really hard, thank you so much. But if you're not working so hard, then he might give you some feedback on how to improve. That's very hard to do, because normally what do we humans wanna do? So a good boss would promote talent, and most people would do what? Promote his or her friends, right? Promote people that they like, promote people who suck up to them. That's the natural human instinct. So in other words, the father, he's almost like selfless. He's always thinking about the greater good, which is really the company or the business. So he's going to work harder than everyone else. If you come to work at 7 o'clock in the morning, he'll come in at 6 o'clock. If you leave at 10 o'clock at night, he'll leave at midnight. He's always working harder than you to show that he is the most loyal to the company, and that's what makes you loyal to the company as well. Okay, does that make sense? So these are the three distinct qualities of a good business person, okay, a good founder, innovative, a good manager of people by sharing the vision, by communicating the vision, and by being fair to people, by promoting talent, okay, and also selfless, very disciplined, okay? We'll work very hard in order to achieve the greater good to ensure the company succeeds. Now, it turns out that these personality traits are consistent with extremely successful people. Okay? So, when we study other great leaders, for example, Gang of Khan, Mohammed, then we will recognize they all share very similar personality traits. And I want you to remember the three distinct qualities that make them great world leaders. The first is they are strategic to the point of visionary. This means they have a vision of what the world should be. And then they have a long-term plan on how to achieve that. They're very strategic. The second thing is they are innovative to the point of revolutionary. Okay? So what they understand is if you wanna change the world, you must destroy the status quo. You must change the way society is structured, okay? And they're willing to do that, even though they know it'll be a very bloody process involving lots of wars, okay? That's the second quality that they have. That's different from everyone else. The third quality is they are extremely disciplined to the point of selfless. They are fanatical and obsessed with achieving their vision. They won't eat, they won't sleep until they achieve their vision. For them, it's all about achieving the vision and the greater good as opposed to personal happiness. Does that make sense? So this is a pattern that we'll see over and over again where the great world leaders that have changed history forever have possessed these three distinct qualities that make them unique of their time. And so Genghis Khan, Mohammed are two examples, but also like Napoleon and Julius Caesar. Basically all the great world conquerors in human history have these similar characteristics. Okay, does that make sense? Now the son is very different, okay? So if the father succeeds because he is innovative, why does the son succeed? No, he's not actually. How do you transform $10 million into $10 billion if you're a business person? What must you do? You must be aggressive, right? You're aggressive risk taker. The father is not a risk taker because he has no opportunities to take risks. So the example here is, you have $10 million, you can go to a bank and say, I have a great business, can you lend me a billion dollars so I can buy out my competitors? Now when you do that, that's risky, but that's how you expand very quickly. So the first thing about the son that's very different from the father is, he succeeds by taking risk that no one else are willing to take. That's the first thing. Who does he promote? His father promotes talent. Who does he promote? Who does he want around him? Exactly, he wants his friends, okay? So he's gonna promote loyalty, all right? If you listen to him, if you're obedient to him, if he likes you, then he will promote you, okay? The father should be different. The father will not do that. Because if you do that, that's gonna hurt the internal structure of your company, right? And the father is selfless. What does a son care about? What drives him? What does he really care about? What sort of, the father is motivated to build a great company, right? He wants to achieve his vision. What drives the son? Usually. It's the idea of personal glory, okay? He's very selfish. You understand? He wants to be remembered. He wants to be famous. He wants to be admired and respected, okay? The father cares about the vision. The son cares about the personal glory. Why would the son put personal glory first? Think about his psychology. What drives him? What does he want to prove? Exactly, exactly. You understand? He's greater than his father. It's insecurity. Because everyone will say to him, you are where you are because your father built a great organization. So for him, he must prove he's better than the father by expanding and by winning glory for himself. Okay, does that make sense? And again, we will see this pattern in human history all the time. And I want you to remember this because this describes perfectly the relationship between Philip II of Macedon, the men who actually built the greatest military in the world and action of the great, who will take this army, the greatest army in the world and conquer Persia. OK? Does that make sense? All right? So over the next two classes, I will show you, Philip, how this relationship between the father and son describes very well the personalities of Philip and Alexander. OK? All right? Does that make sense? OK? So, and this repeats itself throughout history. This makes sense to you, right? You will see this in light. you will see this fraud history. Now, the other thing I want us to look at, another thought experiment is, fraud history, what we discovered is poor countries often conquer rich countries. And for us, that's very confusing, because normally we think if you are rich, you have a strong military, you have advanced technology, and you have a lot of resources. And therefore it's very hard to be conquered. But we see this broad history all the time where poor nations, poor countries, quickly conquered rich nations. So how can we explain this? And to explain this, we'll do another thought experiment. So let's compare North Korea with South Korea. And these countries are same culture, right? Same people, but they're night and day. North Korea we know is poor, South Korea is rich. North Korea is primitive, meaning they are not, they don't have that much advanced technology. South Korea is very advanced, right? Technologically advanced, right? Think of Samsung, the phones, the cars, and the phones they produce, and the computers they produce, right? A very advanced country. The last thing is that North Korea is a dictatorship and South Korea is a democracy. So if we were to take a snapshot of North and South Korea today, then we could easily predict that in 20 years time, North Korea would be poorer, South Korea would be richer. But that may not happen. What is South Korea's problem? What is South Korea's biggest problem? Do you know? It's not having children. In fact, it has the world's lowest fertility rate at 0.8. It's women who refuse to have children. And not only that, but South Korean culture is becoming more and more anti-family. They hate kids. There are lots of restaurants, lots of places that refuse to let kids in. So this is a very weird state of affairs. What's driving the low fertility rate? Do you think? Usually. Why are young women refusing to have children? Because, yeah, right, inequality, right? If you feel that if you're just a normal person, the rich have all the resources, it's very hard for you to advance. So why have children? Okay? Now, North Korea doesn't have this problem, right? Because it's poor. Therefore, it has equality. And because it has equality, people there are united, right? They're not divided, they're united. And what else? They're obedient, right? They listen to what the government tells them to do. And last thing is they're hungry. They work very hard for very little, okay? Do you understand? So, it is possible that in 20 years time, North Korea overtakes South Korea because its people are willing to work harder than the South Korean people, okay? Doesn't make sense. So evidence for this is that right now, North Korea is sending weapons and soldiers to the war in Ukraine. Doesn't make sense. So when you do that, you make a lot of money for yourself. And so with this money, you can upgrade your military. And then what you can do is threaten South Korea. Okay? North Korea, I can say to South Korea, are in military, are stronger than your military, and what will South Korea do in response, you think. North Korea is like, we're gonna come and invade you, what will South Korea do in response? Someone wants to attack you, right? So how do you get this person not to attack you? Exactly, do you understand? All right, give them money. So North Korea doesn't even have to attack South Korea. North Korea just has to threaten to attack South Korea, and South Korea will give them a lot of money, not to attack, do you understand? And by doing that, right, North Korea becomes richer and more military advanced, South Korea just becomes poorer, do you understand? And because North Korea, the army is fighting in other places like Ukraine, it's developing all this experience and expertise that will allow it to eventually overwhelm South Korea. Doesn't make sense. So in this thought experiment, it's possible that North Korea can eventually conquer South Korea. doesn't make sense. And this gives us an understanding of why Macedonia, Macedon, was able to conquer all of Greece, even though Macedon was by far one of the poorest places in Greece at that time. Does that make sense? Because the people are hungry, united, and obedient. Any questions so far about this? So I want you to remember these two thought experiments because they will help us explain a lot of history. And I will refer to these two thought experiments some more as we go along in the course, okay? All right, but does this make sense to you so far? Great, all right. So now let's focus specifically on both the second of Massivan. How was he able to conquer all of Greece? Given that his nation, Massivan, was poor, weakened, divided, okay? All right, so King Philip, okay, he was born in 383 B.C., okay, and I wanna talk about the world of Greece and Macedon at the time of his birth. Okay, so around this time, there are three major powers in Greece, okay? There's Athens. Remember that even though Athens lost the Peloponnesian war, It's still very wealthy and it still has the best navy in all of Greece, okay? So it's still a major power. Then you have Sparta, which for most of Greek history was considered the best military, right? And then you have, sorry, five, two, use another, okay. So the map, okay? So this is Sparta here, to the south, this is Athens. And then to the north it's a place called Thebes. And what's interesting is at this time, Thebes has become the most dominant military in Greece, primarily because Sparta and Athens decimated each other during the Peloponnese War, okay? So because of the war, Thebes has became the dominant power in Greece at this time. Okay, and then to the far north is Macedon, okay? The kingdom of Macedon. Now, Macedon is very poor, we can divide it. So let me explain why it is. First of all, it has a geography problem. The nation is divided between agricultural farmland to the south and mountains to the north, okay? So most of its land can't even grow crops. And where it can grow crops, its farmers are just peasants. Now the problem is that there are lots of tribes in the mountains. And the way they make their living usually is by coming and raiding your farmland. And there's nothing that you can do about it, because if you go chase them, they go back to the mountains. So that's the first problem. The economy is very divided. and the people don't have that many resources. That's the first problem. Second problem is, Macedon is completely surrounded by hostile powers. So you have the kingdom of Freys over here, and that's a long-term enemy. Then you have Illyria over here, and these are war-like, mountainous people who live in fortresses. It's almost impossible to invade them, And it's easy for them to come and attack you. So they're a huge problem. To the south, it's a place called Fisili. And they have one of the best militaries in Greece. They're known for their cavalry, their horsemen. And then of course, there's also thieves, Athens, and Sparta, which also want to play a role in controlling Macedonia. And then over here, of course, across the sea is called Persia. And for some of its history, Macedon was actually a province of Persia. Persia actually conquered or subjugated Macedon. So Macedon is always being threatened by a more superior power. And it keeps on losing these wars. The third problem it has is that it's a kingdom. It's a king. And the king has many, many wives. And why would this be a problem? Exactly. There are a lot of sons and they fight over Hubei king. And the thing is that the sons are always supported by another foreign power, okay? Because the foreign powers want Macedon to be always in conflict, okay? So for most of its history, Macedon was poor, weak, and divided. And then Philip II changes all that. So he's born in 383 and then from 369 to 365 for about five years, he's a hostage in thieves. The reason why is Macedon lost a war to thieves and to ensure that Macedon does not rebel against thieves, Macedon had to send hostages. And so Philip was a hostage in thieves. But he's a prince, so he's treated very, very nicely in thieves. And he do whatever he wants. The thing that he wants to do is, he wants to understand why thieves is a dominant military power in Greece at this time. And he learns from the best even generals. They become his mentors. So what makes thieves so effective is the idea of the sacred ban of thieves. This is the secret to the power of thieves. These are 300 soldiers who spend everyday training to be the best soldiers they can. And in many ways, they're like special forces, okay? And this is model of Sparta, right? The difference is this. The difference is in Sparta, only citizens, only aristocrats can be soldiers. But in Thebes, these 300 people were volunteers. They're commoners who want it to be soldiers. And so the first thing Philip learned in Thebes is anyone can be a soldier, not just the rich, okay? With proper training, anyone can learn to be a great soldier. That's the first thing he learned. Second thing he learned is when you have an elite group of soldiers, it's really about how to use them effectively, okay? So the traditional warfare in Greece at this time it's called the phallax, right? The hoplite phallax, okay? So remember it is like a moving wall. They move together slowly and try to crush the enemy, okay? The innovation that Thebans did was say, we're going to do a slant, okay? The reason why is we do a slant, you can put the 300 sacred band first against the best soldiers of the enemy, okay? And we know that in a fair fight, these 300 will always destroy the first soldiers of the enemy. When you do that, there's a massive psychological effect, right? And so what happens is the phallic's breaks formation. And the phallic's breaks formation, and people start running away, they're all dead. So that is the major innovation of thieves at this time. at this time. And from the best generals of Thebes, Philip understood the importance of discipline in an army. And this is new because in Greece, remember, the Sparins had discipline, but most armies like the Athenians, they were citizen soldiers. They did this for fun, they did this as a civic duty, they did this part time. So they were really training when they weren't fighting. Now when you train, you do discipline. With discipline, you have three major strengths. The first major strength that you have is the idea of mobility, speed. And what this means is your army can march much faster than other armies. So maybe this is important because maybe you want to attack a city, right? If you get there really fast and you're able to siege a city and destroy it, the city cannot ask for reinforcements, OK? These reinforcements will come too slowly. Does that make sense? So this is a major innovation, the idea of mobility, OK? Second is the idea of coordination. Coordination. So different military units are able to work together. And this is really important. So in Greece at this time, there are maybe two different land forces, right? There's a phalanx and then there's a cavalry. And they do their own thing, okay? But with discipline, you can actually get them to work together. And if you get them to work together, you create something called the Anvil and Hammer strategy, okay? Anvil and Hammer, okay? So the idea of an Anvil is you put something in place, okay? and the hammer is you just knock that thing apart. So in this attack, the cavalry becomes the hammer, the anvil is a phalanx. So with discipline, the phalanx is able to lock the other enemy army in place. And then what happens is the cavalry sees this, and they stream in from the back and destroy the enemy. Doesn't make sense. It's called the anvil and hammer strategy. And the Thebans used it, but Philip started to use it as well. And you can use this with discipline, okay? If every soldier knows his or her role in the army. And with coronation, you can also have the idea of flexibility, okay? So remember, the Greeks fought using the hot-light planks and that's it. But what Philip understood is, hey, if I have coronation, I can change my strategy and tactics according to the enemy, right? So he had different units, he had archers, he had shield bearers, okay? People whose job was to hold shields. He had phalanx, and he had cavalry, and in response to different enemies, he would change his strategy using these different units. Okay, does that make sense? And so as over time, this army, if you have these three things, mobility, coordination, and flexibility, You'll be invincible. No one could beat you, okay? Because the very idea that an army could do this at that time was unheard of. Doesn't make sense, right? So that's what he learned in Thebes. It is possible for you to transform your army in a way that makes it highly disciplined. And once you have disciplined, it will become invincible, okay? So he became resolved to take all this education and transform the Macedonian army. He got his chance in 359. The reason why is his brother died, and his brother's son, his nephew, was too young. So he became a regent. He became the sort of placeholder before the sun can become of age. But once he became a regent, he basically became the fact of king for his entire life. And as a regent, he was determined to transform the Macedonian military. And at this time, the Macedonian military was getting destroyed by everyone, okay? Illyria attacked and destroyed the army, Therese attacked and destroyed the army, okay? The Macedonian army was a complete joke. He became determined to transform it. And what he recognized is, if I want to transform the army, I need to turn it into a meritocracy. Okay? Meritocracy. So traditionally, because in Macedon, you have a nobility, it's always the, like, all decisions, decisions are made by social status, okay? So a person arises according to his social status as opposed to his merit. And Philip was determined to change that. And the thing that he did that was extremely controversial was, he made the cavalry, which is full of nobility, equal to the infantry, which was made of commoners, peasants. So in this new system, as long as you perform well in battle, you'll be promoted. And one of the people he promoted very heavily and who would become his most successful general, his name is Parmonion. Parmonion. I want you to remember this guy, Parmonion. because he would basically become Philip's partner in war and his greatest general. Even though Parmigian, he was not, he was born in the Lord nobility, okay? He certainly had some money, but Philip treated him as a partner. And he allowed Parmigian to lead armies on his own. He was not afraid that Parmigian would rebel, okay? He trusted Parmigian. So, Philip was a tremendous, He had tremendous understanding and judgment of people. He knew who to trust, and he knew how to use people effectively. The other thing that he did that was very important was, he needed to make the army loyal to him. And what he understood is, if you want the army loyal to you, you need to do three things, okay? The first thing is you need to fight with them. understand. He was not in the back watching the battle. He was in the front leading the battle. He was training with them every day. He trained harder than everyone else. In fact, in one battle, Philip lost lost in the eye and he had many battle wounds and scars. Okay? And so because of that, his soldiers were fanatically loyal to him. Okay? And also because Philip was fighting with his soldiers every day, he did not want to risk the lives of his soldiers. You understand? He was very strategic. He would not put his soldiers in harm's way. And so his soldiers became even more loyal to him. Second thing that he did was he ate and drank with them. Okay? These common soldiers, he would spend his time just eating and drinking with them. And that told the soldiers, hey, we're equals, we're friends. And I'm willing to listen to your complaints. Okay, here's your opportunity to complain about Commander. Here's an opportunity to complain about me. I'm willing to listen to you. Okay, does that make sense? Now third thing was he was an excellent communicator. He would give speeches explaining his vision, right? He wanted to make Macedonian, Macedon great. He wanted Macedon to conquer Greece and then conquer Persia. He wanted glory for his country. But not only that, but he praised people like Parmigian. He used his speeches to praise soldiers that were good examples. And obviously that made Parmigian feel really good. That made him even more loyal to Philip. So Philip over time was able to build a strong, loyal, unified, disciplined army using these strategies. So the other thing that Phil did was, he started to, while he was starting to build his army, his enemies were still attacking him, right? And what he did that was kind of intuitive was he basically negotiated, understand? He used diplomacy. He understood that having the best military is just a, sorry, let me rephrase this. Having smart diplomacy is just as good as having the world's best military. Does that make sense? Because remember, at this time, it's basically game of thrones. Every nation is at each other's throat. They hate each other. So, Sparta hates thieves, thieves hates Athens. They really didn't get along. So what Philip could do was use diplomacy to build alliances against other enemies. So he was using diplomacy a lot in order to buy time for him to train up his army. He would also marry the princesses of other nations as part of his diplomacy. So Philip was known as a great strategist, but much more importantly he was known also as a diplomat, someone who knew how to negotiate and deceive his enemies. So after he started to build his army, he started to make his move. The first thing he did was he basically secured his northern frontier. He got into these wars with his enemies to the north and he secured his northern frontier. That's important because he wants to move into the south eventually, but he needs to make sure that he's not attacked from behind. So that's the first thing he does. Second thing that he does is in 347, he invades a city called Enphipolis and he conquers it. This is important because Enphipolis has gold mines. Now he has resources. He has money. And with these resources, he can pay his soldiers. Because his soldiers are training every day. They're not farming. They're training every day. So he can now pay them, buy the loyalty of the nobility, and he can stir national sentiment in Macedonia by building projects, by building roads. He can improve the economy. And the last thing that he does with the money is he starts bribing everyone. He basically starts bribing the nobility of Athens, other nations to support him. So he's being very strategic and very clever. In 356, his son in here, X-men of the great, is born to his wife, Olympias. And the last major event is in 338 BCE, is the battle of Choronia. Choronia. This is the last battle between Philip and the people who opposed him. So in Choronia, the two nations that opposed him are Thebes and Athens. But at this time, the problem is the great generals of thieves have all died. And Athens felt basically brought their aristocracy to support him. So Athens didn't really put out a great army. And this battle of Sharia, for the second with his modern, highly disciplined, loyal army destroyed everyone. He crushed thieves. He crushed Athens. and he was not all of Greece. So he destroyed the entire army of Athens and he almost destroyed Thebes. But what happened was, when it was clear that Thebes was about to lose the battle, the sacred ban of Thebes stood in the way. They basically sacrificed themselves so the other army, the other soldiers of Thebes could escape. And so the sacred ban of Thebes was forever destroyed. And the irony of course is, it's the secret ban of thieves that taught Philip how to build a great army. And in his last act, he destroyed the secret ban of thieves. And now he unites all of Greece. Now that he unites all of Greece, his ambition now is to take his army and conquer Persia. So what he did was, he sent his great general Parmenion into Persia. Persia. Remember in Anatolia at this time, which is today Turkey, there are lots of great colonies that are under Persian rule. For the longest time they want to be free of Persian rule. Okay, so Permanian went over with a vanguard about 10,000 men to begin the invasion. Okay, and Philip was about to go over and lead invasion, but his daughter was about to get married. Okay, so he had to attend the wedding. At the wedding, he had one bodyguard because at the wedding there'll be lots of quick triple mats, right? So he wanted to appear approachable. So he didn't have his entire bodyguard in place. He had one bodyguard. This bodyguard took his sword and stabbed him in the rib, killing him. Then this bodyguard was killed by the other bodyguards. So Phil was assassinated before he could launch his invasion of Persia. Okay, and when he died It was like 337. Okay, okay, so Philip was really in the prime of his life He had in like 30 40 years of military conquest to go Okay, he died very young and his son Alexander Who was like 1819 at this time he now became king? It was Alexander who would lead his army into Persia and conquer all Persia and move all the way to India or or like the or Pakistan really. Okay? So, for the longest time historians do not know what happened. How is it possible for this great man Philip II to be assassinated in the prime of his life? Now there are three explanations. There are three major explanations. The first explanation is, it was Persia. Persia knew that Philip was about to invade and so they hired the bodyguard to kill him. Okay? That's the first explanation. Second explanation is it was personal. So the story is very complicated, but apparently the bodyguard and Philip were lovers. They were homosexual lovers and then Philip found someone else and the bodyguard became very jealous. So it's a very complicated story. It was personal. And then there's one more explanation. The other explanation was it was the mother of Alexander, Olympias, and Alexander. Okay? Right? So these are the three explanations. So if you want to, and like honestly, we'll never ever know what happened, okay? But if you want to evaluate a murder, you always look at two things. Look at opportunity. Who has the chance to kill them? You'll get motive. Okay? You understand? So if you look at these two things, let's evaluate all three possibilities. Persia. Okay? It had the motive, But it didn't have the opportunity, you understand? How could it access Phillips inner court, right? And Phillips is not a dumb guy. You would know exactly who to trust and who not to trust. And usually if Persia was afraid of Phillip, what they could do was basically give Spartans and Athens all our money to attack Phillip, right? So I don't think it's Persia. I think most people agree it wasn't not Persia, okay? Second possibility is it was personal. And that's kind of strange, right? Because Philip, he's very good at inspiring loyalty from others. He's also good at reading people, right? So I don't think it was personal. I mean, it could be, but I don't think it is, OK? And this leaves us a possibility of Olympias and Alexander. And here it makes sense because they both have both the motive and the opportunity. So let me first explain motive. The motive is very easy to understand. If Philip were to die, Alexander would become king. And this is at the height of the glory of Macedon. They have the world's greatest military. They conquered all of Greece. Persia is an easy target. And maybe they were afraid that if Philip goes to Persia, it'll be too late. The other problem is, Philip is an excellent judge of character. And what's clear about Alexander, very from a very early age, is he was a very violent young man. He couldn't really control his emotions. If you have Philip, right, you're kind of like, do I really want this guy to be the here to my empire? Could he manage the empire? Plus, remember, Philip has a lot of wives, right? So over time, he could have new sons, okay? Does that make sense? So the motive is very clear. And the opportunity makes sense because they're all one family, right? The bodyguard is in constant communication with Olympias. Okay? And what gives evidence? What provides evidence for this line of thinking is after the death of a bodyguard named Pasanias, Olympias actually made a monument to him. Okay? And next class, when we look at the life of Alexander, we will see a lot of evidence that suggests he wanted his father dead. Maybe he didn't participate in the killing of his father in the plotting of the assassination, but he clearly wanted his father dead. And next class, we will discuss this. So that doesn't make sense to you. And again, what we will understand is this pattern of a great man emerging, who creates a revolution that transforms the world, it will repeat itself in this way many times, including with Muhammad and with Genghis Khan, with Napoleon, with Julius Caesar, okay? But they all have this sort of similar personality and they're all working within a similar social context, okay? Does that make sense? Any questions so far about this? That's right, hostage. That's right. That's a great question, okay? So the question, why did they treat Philip so well and why did he give them so much knowledge? And the answer is, first of all, no one thinks Macedon would ever be a threat. Do you understand? No one takes Macedon seriously. It's like today, no one would take South North Korea seriously, right? Do you understand? Everyone thinks in East Asia, the major powers are China and Japan. And everyone thinks North Korea is a complete joke, okay? This place will collapse in five years' time. So no one during this time ever thought Macedon could ever challenge Sparta or Athens or Thebes. No one did. So it was just overconfidence. Second thing is, if you're the Thebans, you want your enemies are Sparta and Athens, okay? So you wanna build allies. The best way to build allies is by building strong relationships with weaker nations who then rely on you. And the best way to do that is by indoctrinating the future leaders of that nation, like Philip. So basically, they wanted to treat him nice, so Philip would be thankful to thieves. They didn't realize Philip had other intentions. And it's impossible because Philip is one of these individuals, these men who we call great men of history. They stand outside of history. There are many ways not human, okay? They don't behave, normal humans behave, right? Normally if you're a prince, you just wanna have a good time, right? You just wanna enjoy your wealth, you wanna promote your friends, right? And you want personal glory. But Philip wanted to change the world. And so you can't possibly predict that, right? Okay, does that make sense? All right, okay, great question though. Okay, any more questions? Oh great, great question, okay, the phalanx. All right, okay, so Philip not only learned military strategy from thieves, but he was also a military innovator, okay? So he made a lot of changes to the phalanx. So the phalanx, it's very strong, but there are a lot of issues with it, okay? The first major issue with it is it's not very mobile, because everyone's carrying heavy armor. So the first thing that Philip did was he made, he lightened the load, okay? So he had his soldiers wear less armor. Then the question then is, well, if you wear less armor, then how do you protect yourself? And the answer is two things, okay? He did. The first thing he did was he made the spear very long. It became a pike, okay? So it became very hard to reach the phalanx because the spear was in the way, okay? The pike was in the way. And the other thing that he did was he added a new unit called shield bearers. So the shield bearers were on the flanks, one aside to protect the phalanx. So that's how he improved the phalanx. And so when the Macedonian phalanx came into contact with the Greek phalanx, the Macedonian phalanx proved superior because of these invasions. Remember, they were lighter, they could move around faster, And they had longer spears. So they couldn't maintain distance from you a lot longer. And also they had these shield bearers who were mobile and could adapt to situations. So if one part of the violence was being threatened, then the shield bearers could converge on that and basically leak the dam. Does that make sense? So what made Philip so such a genius was, he was very flexible. He was always looking at what happened at battles and making adjustments in order to become stronger. And that's why his soldiers were so loyal to him, because he was such a great general. And he put the lives of his men first and foremost. And what we will discover next class is, Accender is a complete opposite. He's always risking the lives of his men. Does that make sense? Okay, any more questions? But that's a great question, yeah, sorry. So I obviously don't have enough time to go into all the details. There's a lot of changes. But the phalanx is a major innovation. You have the shield bearers in place. To me? Above you? Okay, well they have helmets and they have shields as well. Okay, do you understand? That's right. Yeah, so the shield bearers were really the secret sauce of the Macedonian army. Because the shield bearers were meant to resolve any issues that might arise in battle. Yeah, but yeah, so do you understand how this works? Okay? Okay, but you have the flexibility because these are extremely disciplined and loyal men, okay? And what we'll discover is, when we get to Exander is, even though Exander was bold and aggressive, he would make mistakes, but the loyalty and discipline of the milestone army would compensate for a lot of his strategic mistakes, okay? Does that make sense? Great, any more questions? Okay, so was this interesting for you? Okay, and this is clear, right? Okay, because again, the thing about this class that's different is we build on all this knowledge, okay? We will see how military strategy changed over time. And we'll see how the Greeks, the Macedonians will influence Greek culture, okay? All right, so next class we will do, as I'm not great."}

We're continuing the United States Iran War. As I've said in the previous class, the United States will invade Iran. We don't know when, it might be two years from now, it might be six years from now, okay? But eventually it will happen. And in today's class, I wanna go over some of the reasons why the United States will invade Iran. And I believe that there'll be three major reasons, okay? The first major reason is the United States must defend its empire. Second major reason is that the United States will be pressured by its allies, mainly Saudi Arabia and Israel, into invading Iran. And the third reason is the Israel lobby. So in today's class, I want to explain to you what the Israel lobby is. But first, I need you to understand what Christianity is. So remember that Christianity, it's a religion about a man, Jesus, who we know very little about. We think that he was born in 4 BCE, and then he died in 31 BC, sorry, CE, Cominera. We know that he is from a place called Galilee. we know that the Romans crucified him. And that's about it, okay? What his believers say is that he is God come to earth and he was preaching a gospel or a message that God is returning, the kingdom of heaven is coming. And after he was crucified, he was resurrected and then he went to heaven. And what's really important is that Jesus will eventually return, okay? And this is called second coming, okay? This is the second coming of Jesus. And when he comes, he will bring heaven onto earth. And we will all live forever in peace. Okay, so that's the story of Jesus. Then the question then is, why this religion become so popular, so popular in fact that today about two billion people believe in it. It's the most popular, most popular religion in the world. And at first, the appeal of Christianity is that it was a revolutionary religion that promised a better world to the world's oppressed. So if you look at the early people who follow Christianity, it was slaves, peasants, women. People who were marginalized in society. And the idea of Jesus is that a better world is coming where everyone will be equal. The meek shall inherit the earth. So if you think about it, Christianity is appealing because what it is, it's a free lottery ticket. It doesn't make sense. It's a lottery ticket. It costs you nothing, and hey, if it's right, then you go to heaven. So at first, Christianity was an extremely revolutionary religion, and its basic characteristics in the beginning were, it was revolutionary, it was egalitarian, And it was anti-authority. And so these individuals who before were outcast from society, like criminals, Jesus promised hope, salvation, and redemption. So before if you were a criminal, there was really no way for you to redeem yourself in society. And Jesus is the promise of your salvation and redemption. Okay? And that's why it was so appealing to a lot of people. It became so popular that it became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Now there's a problem. Okay? Because remember, Christianity is a revolutionary, egalitarian, anti-authority religion. And now it's become an empire. So they had to develop new theories to reinvent Christianity as a establishment religion. And as we discussed last semester, the person who did this was Augustine. Augustine. Remember that last semester we read City of God and Confessions. Instead of going to confession, it's really to adapt Christianity as an establishment religion, to reduce its revolutionary nature. So is this all making sense to you? And one problem that Augustine had was the idea of a second coming, that the world will end. He had a major problem with his idea, for many reasons. So the first reason is that the world's gonna end. Why do we have to do anything? Why can't we just drink and party and play video games every day, right? What's the point of working? That's the first problem, right? Second problem is, well, why is Jesus coming back? It's because the world sucks, right? Well, who's in charge of the world? The Catholic Church is in charge of the world. So Jesus is coming back to destroy the authority of the Catholic Church. That's not good. So for many reasons, Augustine basically said, okay, son coming, don't worry about it. Okay? Jesus will come back whenever he wants to come back. But before he comes back, we the Catholic Church will take care of everyone. Okay? All right, so why is this important? This is important because from Augustine onwards, we've had divergent understanding of what the second coming means, okay? For people who believe in the second coming, the term we use is pre-millennialism, pre-millennials, okay? Because the second coming promised a thousand years of peace. Okay, pre-millennism is this, okay? Pre-means before, right? So when Jesus comes back, he will give us a thousand years of peace and prosperity. Okay, you understand? Before he comes back, okay? When he comes back, he will give us a thousand years of peace and prosperity. And what all this means is, no, no, no, no. That thousand years is just a metaphor. It's not actually gonna happen. In fact, it's already happened because the Catholic Church is giving us this thousand years of peace and prosperity. So he's called a millennial list, which means no, okay? That thousand years is just a metaphor. It's not gonna really happen, okay? So that's a second big idea. Now, as we know, because all power became concentrated in the Catholic Church, there's a rebellion against the Catholic Church called the Reformation. Okay? The Reformation. And the idea of the Reformation is God did not mean for His authority to be established in the church, to be held by priests. God is meant to speak to all of us through the Bible. Okay, so what the major difference between the Catholic religion and the Protestant religion is Catholics are not allowed to read the Bible. They don't read the Bible. Whereas Protestants must read the Bible. They must seek meaning and guidance from their interpretation of the Bible. Okay? And because of the Reformation, you now have thousands, tens of thousands of different religions spawning up, okay? Does that make sense? All right? where you have different religions and you have different descent. So let's look at England, okay? England. So England is a king and before the Catholic Church was supposed to have authority over the king. And of course the king did not like that. So he supported the Reformation and he changed the Catholic Church in the church of England, which he would have authority over. But once the Reformation started, again, you are now allowed to read the Bible. And because of that, you have thousands of new religions coming up in England. And they believe different things. But one thing that they all believe in is the Bible is the supreme authority. The Bible is the supreme authority, not the king. So this started a major conflict between these groups and the king. And these people are called dissenters. And eventually this led to something called the English Civil War where the dissenters, the Peritans, killed the king. But then the king was reestablished. And so this led to decades and decades of fighting in England. So one way that the king tried to resolve this conflict is by sending all these dissenters to America. To America. And the idea is this. These dissenters believe that the Bible is a supreme authority. The Bible asks us to do certain things, okay? Because it's written in the Bible. For example, you're not allowed to drink. You're not allowed to dance. You're not allowed to have any fun. You must focus on your own spiritual improvement. Okay? You're not allowed to have slaves. And so because they believed these things, they were constantly in conflict with the establishment, okay? With people in power. And so the king was like, guys, if you really believe in these things, go to America. Why this? There's nobody in America. So you can build your own kingdom of heaven. Do you understand? Okay, so this is the origin of the United States. The United States was founded as a Christian nation, which put the Bible as a supreme authority. Okay, does that make sense? You guys probably don't know this about the United States. You think the United States, it's a non-religious, secular, multicultural nation believes in science, right? That's what it looks like from the outside. But inside its soul, its history, it is a Christian nation dedicated to achieving the kingdom of God on earth. And using the Bible as the supreme authority guide to achieve this kingdom on earth. Okay, doesn't make sense. All right, so these people in America, these centers. One question that they always ask themselves is why isn't Jesus back yet? The second coming. Why isn't the second coming back yet? Different people have different explanations. From this group come two more groups. You have some people who call them You have some people who call them post-millennias. And post-millennias believe that Jesus will come back after we establish a thousand years of the Christian church in the world. It doesn't make sense. So we have to prove that we are worthy of God. God's not gonna come back and establish this for us. We have to do it ourselves. So these are people called posts. We just say that Jesus will come after the thousand years. But then you have another group called dispensation lens. I don't even know how to spell this word actually. Okay, anyway, dispensation is historic, okay? All right, so now the pre-millennias are split into two other groups. So the historic pre-millennias are people who believe, what the early Christians believe, which is that Jesus is gonna come back. Don't worry when he's coming back, just be a good person and he'll come back eventually, okay? It's not up to us to ask when he's coming back, he's God, okay? He has a plan, he knows what he's doing. Just be patient guys, okay? That's the historic pre-millennials. And then you have another group called the Despinationless, Despensationless, Premillennials, okay? And what they believe is something different. They believe that, oh, in the Bible, if you read the Bible very, very closely, it tells you how and why Jesus will return. What the Bible says is that there must be a nation called Israel, okay? And Israel is a nation of Jews. And then Israel has something called the temple, because that's where God resides. It must have a temple. And then what will happen, according to the Bible, is that the antichrist, or Satan, lives. And then there'll be an antichrist, Satan, who will be the great deceiver. He'll pretend to be God. He'll pretend to be Messiah, but he's really Satan. Okay? And then he will launch a war when all the nations of the world will try to attack Israel. And at this point, Jesus will come back and he will destroy the Antichrist. He will save Israel and he will usher in a thousand years of peace. Before and then a thousand years later, you will have the last judgment Where God will judge us to be either worthy or not worthy If we are worthy we'll live on forever If we're not worthy Then we'll burn in hell forever. Okay? Okay, so there are different variations of this Prophecy with what's what what they believe. Okay? So in other words The historic pre-millennias, what they believe about the coming of Jesus is, it's a promise. Okay? Jesus promises to return, he's God, he will keep his promise. He's probably very busy right now with other things, so don't worry about it guys, okay? Let's just be patient and trust in Jesus. That's what they believe. But the dispensationalists, pre-millenniists, believe that the prophecy is a plan. It's something that we must achieve to bring Jesus back. And we do what the Bible tells us to do, which is to say to have Israel as a nation run by the Jews, to have the temple and then to face the end of Christ then Jesus will return. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, now, so these are the four different views of the end times. Okay, you have the historic Premillinus who believe that Jesus has promised to return. Let's just wait guys, don't worry about it. You have the this sensationalist, pre-millennials who believe that we have to work hard to bring Jesus back, okay? And then you have the A-millennials who are like, now, the thousand years, it's just a metaphor, it's not gonna happen, don't worry about it guys, okay? And then you have the post-millennials who believe that it's up to us to establish a good world. Jesus is not gonna do it for us, if we do this then Jesus will return. Okay? And so, but remember guys, okay, this is a very simple version of the four different beliefs. Even within each belief, there are variations, okay? Because again, there are two billion people who believe in Christianity and they all believe something different. Okay? Does that make sense? Are we clear about the four different ideas? Any questions? Okay, so, okay, okay. So you don't actually have to remember this, okay? But all I'm trying to show you is that even within Christianity, there's debate, okay? But there's a concern, an obsession, as to when Jesus will return and how he will return. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so, This is important. Now, most Christians don't believe in dispensationalist premillennialism, okay? In fact, most Christians believe that dispensationalist premillennialism is actually pretty evil. Why? Why would it be evil? We should not, we cannot believe in dispensationalist premillennialism because it's evil. Why? As a Christian, what would you think this is evil? What's a problem with believing that there's a plan in the Bible? What would that be anti-Christian? Okay, so this is hard, okay, but but the idea is that With this plan you're trying to manipulate God it doesn't make sense Okay, you're trying to force God to return and you shouldn't do that If you believe in God, then you will trust God and you will try your best to be a good person Which is what the Bible asked you to do and when God returns is none of your business. Okay. It's not our concern So the dispensationalist pre-millennias are an extremely controversial Minority within Christianity, okay Christians most Christians don't actually believe this and they find that a lot of these beliefs to be evil and maybe even blasphemous. You're insulting God with this sort of thinking. The problem is that of all these groups, the dispensationalists, millenias, pre-millenias are the most organized and they're the most fanatical. they really believe that this is true. We know that throughout history, those who achieve their objectives are people who tend to be the most united and who are the most fanatical in achieving their objective. That's the first point. Second point is that this sort of belief thrives in a time of massive uncertainty and inequality, like the time that we are living in today, where inequality is growing, where there's more instability and uncertainty. So in other words, there are more and more people who believe in dispensationalist pre-millennialism. Does that make sense? Okay, all right. So why this is important is that dispensationalist pre-millennialists Christians have done a lot to cause conflict in the Middle East. Okay? So they're the ones who are actually encouraging conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis. They're the ones who want Israel and Iran to go to war. Why? Why are they actually encouraging conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis? Why are they encouraging a war between Iran and Israel. Why would they want to war between Iran and Israel? Well, no, no, well, Israel is already back. Why? Because it's part of the prophecy, you understand? It's part of the prophecy. The prophecy is that Israel must be, must first be, we constitute it as a nation. Okay, this happened in 1948. And then Israel must go to war with other nations. Okay, does that make sense? So these Christians are actually promoting war between Israel and its neighbors. Okay, does that make sense? All right. Okay, so now the other thing is that after the Reformation, okay, they developed a new theology called Christian Zionism. Christian Zionism. Okay? What is Christian Zionism? Christian Zionism is the belief that as a Christian you must support Jews in the return to Israel. Okay? So because remember that Israel as a nation was only found in 1948. And then basically in about 70 BCE, the Romans burned down the temple. So for about almost 2000 years, really, the Jewish people have not lived in, Sorry, sorry, sorry. The Jews were not in control of Israel, okay, about 2000 years. And there are Christians who believe that it is our responsibility, it is our duty to help Jews take control over Israel. And they believe this for many different reasons. So Christian Zionists, some may believe that, that's what the Bible says. God promised Israel to the Jews, okay? So Christian Zionism intersects with dispensationless primalism. There are Christian Zionists who believe that, okay, for Jesus to return, we also, we need Israel back and we need Israel to be in conflict with the Middle East. Okay? So in other words, the Middle East, okay? All of them, all of them, okay? So Christian Zionism, I mean, you can make the argument that it's a pretty evil idea. Why? Because they're using the Jewish people as a tool, as a mechanism in order to achieve what they believe, which is the return of Jesus. Okay, does that make sense? Because Christianity believes that if Jesus returns, then all Jews, then Judaism as a religion will cease to exist. Two thirds of all Jews will die in the battle, and the rest, a third, will immediately convert to Christianity. So you can make the argument that Christian Zionism, it's a pretty cynical and a pretty evil idea. And then from Christian Zionism, we have the idea of Zionism. And Zionism is the belief among certain Jews that two things, okay? One is that the Jews are the chosen people of God and that Israel is a promised land. And therefore, Jews must return to Israel. Okay, does that make sense? But what's important is before Christian Zionism came along, Zionism was not, Jews didn't really think this, okay? So it was Christians who supported this idea of Zionism. And even when this idea came about, which was about 20 years ago, it was an extremely unpopular religion, a very extremely unpopular idea. The reason why is Jews didn't think they were a race of people. They felt they were a religion. They felt that, OK, I'm in Iraq. Well, guess what? I'm in Iraqi like everyone else. I may have a different belief, but I'm so Iraqi. They didn't put the religion above their nationality or their race. Do you understand? And Zionism is like, no, being a Jewish person is a race. And therefore you must return to Israel. The problem with all this is that in Israel, Palestine, it was mainly Arab people. So there were very few Jewish people. And in fact, Zionism couldn't convince anyone to come to Palestine. But then of course, the Holocaust happened. In the act of Holocaust, many Jews start to go to Israel. And in 1948, they established a state of Israel. And the Christian Zionists and the dispassionless Puymillennias were very happy with the establishment of Israel because they feel that we've achieved the first step in this plan to bring Jesus back. Does that make sense? Okay. So, to summarize, the main message is this. Here's what you need to know. First is that there are many Christians who believe that Israel and the Jews must be used as a tool to bring Jesus back. That's the first thing. Second thing is that America was founded as a Christian nation. Therefore, its soul is Christian. Its first leaders were Christians who believed in Christian Zionism. Their descendants now control the military and the foreign policy apparatus of America. That's the second thing. And the third thing is that Israel, as a nation, thinks that it can use Christian Zionism in order to advance its geopolitical interests, which is to basically gain control over the Middle East. Okay, do you understand? And that's what's driving the conflict between Israel and Iran. Does that make sense? Okay. What's driving the conflict between Israel and Iran is America believes it has a religious responsibility to protect Israel against Iran. In fact, if there's a war between Iran and Israel, that's a good thing because it's gonna drive this prophecy and the return of Jesus, okay? And then, and people in Israel are like, If you know what, if we go to war with Iran, America is gonna fight for us. So why not? Right? We're gonna have to fight this war, America's gonna do it for us. So why not fight this war? We lose nothing, we gain everything from this war. So the idea is that all this is driven by a religious worldview, understanding the world. And over time, this worldview will only become more popular in America. Okay? Does it make sense? All right. Okay, good. Any questions about this? Anything that's not clear about what I just explained? Do you mean to clarify anything? Okay. I don't understand the question. Can you repeat the question? Right, so, okay. So, both Judaism and Christianity are religions. Okay? There's no race. There's no race to the idea of Christianity, right? You can be Chinese and Christian, you can be American and Christian, it doesn't matter. All right? And that's what the Jewish people say as well. I can be Chinese and Jewish, I can be American and Jewish. Being Jewish is a religion. But the idea of Zionism is that being Jewish person is a race. In fact, you are directly descended from the Hebrews in the Bible, which is complete nonsense. This is not true. Okay? So, Zionism is the main political belief of Israel. Right? Why does Israel exist? Because Israel is the promised land that God gave to His chosen people. And this was a promise that dates back at least 3,000 years to the time of Abraham. And it's written in the Bible, therefore it must be true. Okay, does that make sense? All right. Any other questions? Okay, that's a great question. Okay. All right. So I'm making the argument that Christian Zionism and dispensation-less pre-millennism will over time become more popular religions in America. Okay. And Charles asked, well, why? Okay, let's go back to the founding of Christianity. Why did Christianity become so popular? It became popular because it was in the Roman Empire. At that time, there was something called the Pax Romana. Which meant the Roman peace? Which meant that the Romans controlled everything, therefore there were no wars, therefore people were at peace, right? And you think that's a good thing, right? The problem is that if there's peace, then you have massive inequality. Because war is a mechanism back then of social mobility. War kills people. And if war kills people, that creates opportunities for the people who are alive. But if there's no war, then what happens is if I'm a rich person, guess what, guys, I become more rich. If you're poor, what happens? You become more poor. So as a poor person, what do you think? You think that life is hopeless. Life is pointless. There's no future, there's no hope, right? And so Jesus comes along and says, listen, if you believe in me, then I will bring the king of heaven onto earth, and I will destroy inequality. Everyone will be the same, okay? So again, back then it was a free-law-ter ticket. Today we live in something called the Pax Americana. And the Pax Americana, same thing where for the past 70 years there's been peace around the world, right? Very few people have died. But all that means really is that inequality has increased. Fewer and fewer people have money, okay? Guys, billionaires make no sense. Do you understand? Why should a few people have all the money? That makes no sense. Because money is meant as a mechanism of exchange and transaction, right? You use money, you should spend your money. If it's all in the bank, what's the point of that? Okay? So having billionaires is a bad thing. And if you go to America, you'll find that there are many young people who feel that life is pointless. So they're looking for alternatives. You understand? And this idea of dispensationalist, premillinism, which is like, what's happening right now in Israel will lead to a better world? That's kind of attractive to you. You understand? Right? Well, because you're poor and you're stuck being poor. Guys, imagine you are a delivery person in China, in Beijing, okay? You're like a Kui-di Yuan, right? What hope do you have for the future? You have, your life is pointless and hopeless. No one's gonna marry you. Even if someone marries you, you can't have children because you can't afford to have your children go to school. You can't buy a house. You can't afford anything. You're stuck being a delivery person for the rest of your life. Do you understand? Do you know how many delivery-per-speople there are in China? Millions and millions. You have millions and millions of young men who have no hope in the future. Yes, because Jesus is coming. And He's going to destroy the world we live in. That's exactly right. Christianity is a free lottery figure. It costs you nothing. And if you win, you win big. What does it cost you? It costs you nothing, right? Do you understand? That's why it will become more popular over time. Excuse me? All right, so what you do is you support America, you support Israel, you support the war against Iraq. You want more conflict in the Middle East because the conflict in the Middle East will drive the prophecy, right? Do you understand? That's what you want. You want more war. What good does peace do you? Peace just means tomorrow you'll still be poor and hopeless. But war, it's an opportunity for a new world, exactly. So all this inequality is making people much more extreme and desperate, which will lead people more people to believe in dispensationalist pre-millennism. The government, of course, does not want any instability. But what can the government do about it? You're absolutely right, okay? So the government could provide social welfare to poor people, but where would the money come from? Right, you understand? Who's more dangerous to you? A few rich people or millions of poor people? No, no, no, no, no. A few rich people are much more dangerous than millions of poor people, you understand? That's right. United, right? Poor people don't know how to unite. That's right. Yeah, but. But they don't actually. Right. So does this make sense? So this is the. So it's hard because this is religion. And we're not religious. I'm not religious. You're not religious. So we don't understand how religious people think. But remember that on this planet or most people are religious. And they take their religion very, very seriously. Okay? Do you understand? They're willing to die for the religion. Because they think that if I die from my religion, I'll go to heaven. Excuse me? Okay? All right, so that's exactly right. Do you understand? Okay? All right? Because you're not giving people any hope and religion gives people hope. Listen, in the real world, the poor will always lose, the rich will always win. No matter what happens. That's right, that's why they're poor. Okay."}

This is about the 19th century when the British Empire is at its peak. As you can see, it really controls most of the world. So the question then is how did this happen? Why is it that England was able to surpass Spain, France, Germany, the Holy Roman Empire, Russia become the dominant hegemon in the world? So my argument to you today is it has to do with the fact that throughout its history, England was forced to innovate in a more rigorous and relentless way than other nations. And a lot has to do with its geography, okay? So as you can see from its geography, Great Britain, this is Ireland, this is England, Wales, Scotland, it is an extremely mountainous region. And with very, they have a lot of rivers, but there are no major rivers, which meant that for most of its history, Britain never had a major population center that could grow and grow until it overwhelmed the entire geographic area. This meant that for most of its history, England, Britain was engaged in a process what we call open competitive cooperation. Not only that, but because this area is very mountainous and because these groups, these tribes, are divided heavily amongst themselves, throughout most of its history, Britain is actually pretty easy to invade. They have no centralized authority, so it's possible for other groups of people to come and create settlements in Britain, which which is what the Vikings did, which is also what the Romans, the Amnias, so throughout its history, Britain had underwent a series of credistruction, where the elites were constantly replaced by new elites. Okay, and because Britain is poor, because there's always conflict within Britain, eventually, the English people were forced to migrate overseas to create new opportunities. And this process of colonial expansion led to the British Empire. Okay, so there's a famous saying that the British Empire was founded by accident. Okay, there was no intention to create this empire, but because of these historical, geographic, demographic forces, Britain became the world's largest empire. Let's very quickly look at Britain's demographic history. So for most of its history, because of its geography, because of the fact that it was poor and divided, the population of Britain stayed very flat, okay, up until the year 1,000. What happened in the year 1,000? Well, Europe became wealthier and wealthier in engage in a proto-industrial and agricultural revolution which caused the demographic to increase. But unfortunately, if your demographics increase, but you don't have improvements in sanitation, in health, in nutrition, well what happens? You have something called the black death, which causes the entire population of Europe, including Britain, to collapse. After the black death, the Europeans start to engage in the gunpowder revolution. with that you have industrialization, urbanization, and that causes the population to increase. But if you see about the middle of the 17th century up until about 1800, the population is flat. This is what we call the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Britain is a first European nation to undergo the Industrial Revolution. And what that meant is you have this mass migration from the rural areas into the urban areas, especially London, okay? So why would this population or demographic shift cause the population to stay flat? Well, the first reason is it's really, really unsafe in the cities. Diseases, malnutrition, lack of sanitation cause people to die really, really young. Also during this time, because of the massive inequality in Britain, people are forced to migrate overseas in order to seek better opportunities, mainly America. But they'll also go to Australia and New Zealand. So even though the Dutch were the first to discover and settle Australia and New Zealand, it is really the British who, because of Fresh Back Home, they will settle in Australia and New Zealand. And today, Australia and New Zealand, of course, British, they have a British culture instead of a Dutch culture. Okay? Starting in about the year 1800, because of improvements in nutrition, sanitation, the population explodes, all right? And this is true for throughout Europe, and this is really why Europe will eventually conquer the world. All right, so let's go briefly into the history of the British Isles. So at first we believe that the British Isles were settled by an agricultural people, okay? These are the people who built Stonehenge. Now, if you remember way back to beginning of this course, back in September, I discussed Gopelay Tepe, right? Gopelay Tepe is a temple in Anatolia in what is modern-day Turkey that shows that the desire for humans to settle down and found religious societies. Well, Gopelay Tepe is very similar to Stonehenge. There are both astronomical calendars that measure the stars, measure time, and try to bring divine energy onto the earth in order to feed our culture. Okay? So you can argue that what's happening is the Gopitepi culture, it's spreading all throughout Europe and it gets into the British Isles. But eventually, these people are conquered by the Amnaya. And if you look at the DNA evidence, a lot of these people were eventually wiped out by the Amnaya and replaced. This is a process of destruction that will happen throughout British history. The next major development is the Roman conquests of Britain. When the Romans conquer Britain, they bring Roman technology, which is aqueducts, irrigation, urbanization. They will also bring Roman customs, especially law. Okay, so now you have a legal tradition in Britain that continues on to today. They will found a city called Londonium, which is now modern day London, off the river Thames. Okay, and this city will eventually become the largest city in Europe. After the Romans will come a new group of people who are Germanic, okay. So these are people who used to live in Denmark and northern Germany. And because of population pressure, they are forced to migrate overseas and they settle in Britain. There are three different tribes of people that settle in Britain. They are the Angles, the Saxons and the Jukes. And together we will collectively call them the Anglo-Saxons. And at this point in history, this culture, this language, it's no different from that of Germany. Okay, so if you were to go to this place in about the year 800, they're speaking the same language, which is West Germanic. And today we call it Old English. Again, what's really important to remember is it's fairly easy to settle down in Britain because there's no centralized authority. So after the Anglo-Saxons comes the Vikings from Denmark. Okay, and even though England has no major rivers, It has thousands of rivers. So it's fairly easy for the Vikings with their very fast longships to come and make settlements. So as you can see, the Danelaw are territory that is seeded by the Anglo-Saxons to the Vikings. Okay? And now you have this merger of the Viking culture with the Anglo-Saxon culture. This process of creative destruction continues with the Norman conquest of England. This year 1066, this battle is called battle of Hastings, in which when the conqueror of Normandy in France, he comes and conquers the British Isles, Britain. There's a significant for two reasons. The first reason is that the Normans are Vikings who settled down in France, in the Erechor Normandy that's off the British coast. And remember, before the Anglo-Saxons were Germanic people, so their focus was on northern Europe. Because the Normans conquered Britain, Britain now is united with parts of France. So Britain is drawn into the politics of France, which will lead to something called the Hundred Years' War, in which Britain, the English, are trying to maintain their territory in France. So that's the first major geopolitical consequence of the normal common squares. The second consequence, which is also rather significant is a radical change in the English language. So before, the English accent spoke a Germanic language we call Old English. Now you have a merger of the Germanic language with French and Latin. So French is the language that the normal spoke, but Latin is the official language of the educated elite of Europe. So now you have Latin and French elements to learn into Old English, and that creates a new language we call Middle English. And in Middle English, of course, we'll give rise to modern English. This is significant because what makes Middle English different from Old English is Middle English is a lot easier to learn because remember, now you have a very customary nature to To Britain, you have Vikings, you have Anglo-Saxons, you have French, you have Normans. They all need to speak one language. So the best elements of these different languages are blended into Middle English. And this tradition continues today because if you think about it, English is the most widely spoken language in the world. Why? Because it's the easiest to learn. All right? Now you may argue that, no, it's because we live in the Anglo-American Empire and And therefore, people are incentivized to learn English. But at the same time, what I will show you next class is the reason why they were able to establish the Anglo-American Empire, a lot has to do with the fact that English is easy to learn, and therefore, it's easier to spread soft power. Right? Because when you learn a language, you're not just learning a language, you're also learning a culture. You're learning a history. Right? And that's what we call soft power. And the British did this better than anyone else. Now the Americans do this better than anyone else. But it starts with the Norman Conquest in 1066. All right. All right. No, so as I mentioned, what's really important about Britain is it really never had centralized authority. Maybe now and then you had a great king like Alfred the Great. But it was never centralized because the king could never a sort of authority over the different feed-dumps. So whenever King does that, the nobles get together and they rebelled. So in 1215, King John tries to impose taxes on the nobles in order to finance wars in France. Because again, the English are trying to maintain their territory in France. And that creates a lot of conflict with the French themselves. So they fight a lot of wars and you need money to pay for these wars. So King John was trying to make the nobles pay taxes. So what the nobles do, and this is gonna be consistent pattern throughout British history, is they rebel. And they force King John to sign a document called the Manicardia, okay? The Great Charter. And the Great Charter is significant because it severely limits the power of the king. Now, this has happened throughout human history before, when the nobles rebel and they force a compromise for the king. This has happened throughout human history, but this is actually the first time that this has been written down and become part of the British tradition. This will become part of what we call the British Constitution. What makes the British Constitution unique is it's not written down, it's not a document like the US Constitution is, it is a set of traditions and norms. Okay, so this begins the British Constitution, the Magna Carta. Right, what I wanna do now is look at different clauses in the Manicard. It's a very old document, so most of the stipulation, most of the clauses don't need to apply, but there are three that do apply, okay? So I want us to just look at very closely at certain clauses within the Manicard. All right, clause 10. With anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews, dies before the debt has been repaid, his here shall pay no interest on the debt. Okay, this is really interesting. This year, 1215, there are Jews in England. Why are there Jews in England? OK. So let me explain the history of Europe at this time. So Europe is entirely Catholic. The Catholic religion does not allow for something called usury. And the idea of usury is you charge interest on debt. Because that goes against the teachings of the Catholic church that goes against the teaching of God. Also, it's socially destructive, right? Because if you fall into debt, you're basically stuck there for all eternity. So the Catholic Church explicitly forbids charging interest on debt. But this is really important, debt is extremely profitable. So the way that the king and the nobility get around this taboo is they get Jews, okay, to lend out money and to charge debt. And then the king gets part of that, right? Also, because Jews are heavily disliked anyway because they engage in money lending and usually the king also gets them to go collect taxes, So the Jews throughout European history have been the scapegoats for the elite. They're the ones who charge usury. They're the ones who collect taxes. They're also the ones who will engage in businesses for the nobles. So they basically subcontract businesses from the nobles and they're very good at that. And why do Jews agree to do this? Because the king and nobles provide protection to the Jews. So over time you have this huge problem where even nobles owe money to the Jews. And the problem of debt creates a lot of social tension within England. So in the Magna Cod it says very explicitly that yes you still owe money to Jews but if you die, you're here does not have to pay interest. Because the problem of debt, again, is not the debt itself, the principle of the interest. Okay? So does that make sense, you guys? This is really important because if you want to understand World War II, you want to understand the Holocaust, it starts way back here. Okay? All right. So the two most important classes in the Magna Carta that I still apply today is 39 and 40. So let's look at 39. No free men shall be seized or imprisoned except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land. This creates a new principle in British history called due process. This means that if you are, if you come into a crime, you are still guaranteed a jury, a trial before you are punished. There's a process in which you are found guilty for your crime. This is what we call due process. Number 40, to no one will we sell, to no one, deny or delay, write our justice. This means that no one is above the law. Okay, so number 30 establishes the idea of due process. Number 40 establishes the idea of rule of law. Everyone is guaranteed due process. Not even the king has the power and authority to take away due process from someone. Alright and this establishes the British common law tradition and this becomes the basis for the American Constitution. Alright okay so as I mentioned because of the Roman conquest Britain now is forced to defend its territory in France and this leads to a series of disastrous wars in France called the Hundred Years War. I don't have time to go into the history but obviously there are certain very important figures on the merchant 100 years war, the most famous being Joan of Arc, okay? Joan of Arc, who is this French mystic, a teenager, girl who leads the French armies to victory against the British and their allies, right? During this time, there's also a civil war fought in Britain called the War of the Roses, between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. You may like the Game of Thrones television series, I'm not sure if you watched it, but that series actually based on the Civil War between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. This goes on for a long time. It's very, very deadly. It almost destroys Britain. But eventually, a man named Richard of York, Richard III, he emerges victorious from the Civil War. But he has a problem. His problem is his family, the House of York, had to borrow a lot of money from overseas. the Florentines, the Medecins, in order to finance the war. Once we became king, he thought, well, I'm king, and I don't have to pay you back. So now the bankers are angry at him. And if the bankers are angry at you, you have a problem. Because what bankers will do in this circumstance is finance an invasion of your country. So the Medecins, the Florentine bankers, they sponsor the man named Henry Tudor, Henry Tudor, who is of the House of Lancaster, but he grew up in France. And they sponsored him to invade England and defeat Richard III. And this is the house of Tudor. And so, Henry Tudor becomes Henry VII, and his son becomes Henry VIII, who is one of the most famous kings in British history. He's famous because he decides to negate the authority of the pope. He decides on the king, I don't have to listen to anyone, even the pope. And this came in the past because Henry VIII was trying to divorce Catherine of Aragon and the pope would not agree. So the Henry VIII decides to set up his own church called the Church of England and separate himself from the Vatican. Now, what's really important for us to remember is there's only one difference, Only one difference between the Church of England and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church swears loyalty to the Pope. The Church of England swears loyalty to the King of England. That's it, guys. There's no other difference. The customs, the doctrine, the rituals are all the same. Okay, there's only one difference. He will have a very famous daughter called Queen Elizabeth. All right? So because of the Reformation, there's a huge religious civil war going on between the Catholics and the Protestants. Okay, so Elizabeth, why she is so consequential is, she's on the throne for 40 plus years. And what makes her extremely significant is, she brings stability to England by sympathizing with the Protestants, but also by working with the Catholics. So even though there are all these Catholic conspiracies against Elizabeth in order to still install a Catholic monarch, she's still able to resist these conspiracies, these rebellions, and establish a pretty stable nation. At the same time, during her reign, Shakespeare will write his plays. Next class, we are doing Shakespeare. Because of Shakespeare, there would be no English language. There's no English language. You can also argue there'd be no British empire. So next class, we'll spend an entire class on analyzing how Shakespeare created the English language and created the possibility of the British empire. Okay, that's next class. Francis Drake is the most famous pirate at this time. And he is a trusted deputy of Elizabeth. Elizabeth has a policy of piracy. England is poor, Spain is rich. So what do you do? You steal from the rich and you give to the poor. And that's what Sir Francis Drake did. So at this time, England is emerging as a naval power. And it's going to surpass both Spain and France become the dominant navy in the world. And as you know, it's really the navy that allows the British Empire to control the world. The major innovation of the British, of the English, is how they fight at sea. Traditionally, the way you fight naval battles is by ramming the enemy and then boarding the ship and then killing everyone, okay? That's what the Romans did, that's what everyone did. The English decided that's silly because we're always outnumbered, we're always outmenred. So they pioneered long range cannon warfare where from a distance, maybe a few hundred meters, you will blast your enemy with cannons. There are lots and lots of problems with this. The first problem is you could possibly sink your ship because the cannons are very heavy. Also, you could blow up your own ship because the cannons are very explosive. So the cannons aren't very accurate. But the English persisted, even though you can make the argument that this type of warfare, it's not sustainable. And in the beginning, for the first few decades, the way they fought was terrible. But the thing about the British that made them very similar to the Romans is they were relentless. They were willing to suffer heavy casualties, major setbacks, major failures, and still persist until they eventually won. That's the mentality of the British. That's very Roman. All right, so this is 1588, the Battle of the Spanish Amarta. And this is something that's heavily celebrated in England because for the English, it marks the day when the British Navy ranked supreme over the seas. This is a day that the Spanish Amarta was conquered and destroyed by the English. Something that's really important for us to remember is that in a year later in 1589, the Spanish will defeat the English, and the English will suffer tens of thousands of casualties. So what's important first to remember is that these wars go back and forth. There's no one time when, okay, now the British are dominant. What matters is persistence, what matters is resilience. And in that respect, the English are far superior to the European adversaries. Okay, so Queen Elizabeth dies, and King James of Scotland inherits the English throne. So now Scotland and England are united. What's significant about King James is he produces them called the King James Holy Bible. This is something that the Protestants have been demanding for a long, long time. Remember the difference between the Protestant and Catholics is the Catholics are not allowed to read the Bible, to please tell the parishioners what to believe, what the orthodoxy is. The Protestant believe that everyone must read the Bible. So the King James Bible, it's the first time that the Bible has been mass produced for everyone. So this spreads Protestant very quickly throughout the British Isles. Also what's really significant is with the Bible, now you've standardized the language. Now you can make a transition from middle English to modern English, language we speak today. 1620 is significant because it's the year when the pilgrims on the Mayflower, they moved to America to found a new colony, a new civilization, a new empire that will take over the world, OK? Why the pilgrims moving to America? Well, the process are divided into two major factions at this time. Yet the Puritans, who are the Puritans? The Puritans believe that the Church of England is too Catholic, and so therefore we must purge the Church of England of Catholic tendencies, like rituals, like priests, okay? The Pilgrims are what we call separatists, okay? So there's another group called the Pilgrims, the separatists, who believe the Church of England it's too corrupt, it's too evil, it's too much like the Vatican, therefore we should abolish it, or we should just separate from it. And so of course they were persecuted by the king. And as a compromise, the programs were allowed to go to America to build a new civilization based on their beliefs. And this civilization of course, what we call America. All right, so that's something that you must remember that America was founded by programs who wanted to build a kingdom of heaven on earth. And we'll discuss this next week when we discuss the American Revolution. Back in England, there is a civil war now raging. And it starts again when the king tries to impose too much authority over the nobles. But there's also religious dimension to it, because the Puritans want to impose a religious state on everyone. So the fanatics at the other stage are the Puritans. And what will happen is the Puritans will emerge triumphant under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, And he will establish something called the Commonwealth of England. And this is a disaster. It doesn't really work out well because it goes against British tradition. Remember the idea of the Puritans is they want to establish a religious, centralized theocracy on England. But England has always been pretty independent and autonomous. So what happened is after Carmel dies, So, come on, of course, away, and the nobles reinstate a new king, okay? Who is Charles II. After he dies, James II will take the throne. The problem of James II is he's a Catholic, okay? He's a Catholic. And so there are a lot of English who are afraid that he will move too close to France, Spain, and the Vatican. And these are British enemies, okay? So what will happen is this, the nobles would invite a Dutch king, Wilhelm of Orange, who is of British blood, to come to England in the year 1688. And Wilhelm of Orange will bring about 10,000 soldiers to Britain. This is an invasion, this is the very last invasion that succeeds in Britain. King James has a larger army. But what will happen is King James is not very decisive, he's not very effective. So a lot of his army will desert him. So basically his army sort of dissipates and he's allowed to go to France. And when the orange, bloodless, not bloodlessly, but he's very quickly able to assume the throne. And this is significant because, and this is called the glorious revolution. This is significant because it establishes for the first time, officially, the sovereignty of parliament over the king. Okay, this is really important, okay? Now it's official. Parliament is the ultimate authority, ultimate sovereignty in Britain. And the king is a figurehead. All right, and this is significant because it will now allow Britain to energize the middle class. If you're a middle class, You now have an incentive to work hard because now there's patents, there's trademarks. There's incentive for you to get rich. And this will lead to, of course, the Industrial Revolution. So the Glorious Revolution is one of the main contributing factors to the Industrial Revolution in Britain. This is all specific because in 1694, the Bank of England is established. Now, I can't unless that's enough what a huge deal this is. So let me explain what is a big deal. And I want to make sure you understand, because now we go into finance and economics. And I really haven't taught finance economics before. I want to make sure that you understand the idea here. So before, if you're a king and you want to fight a war, what you do is you borrow money from the rich. And these are usually cartels. So Charles II brought a lot of money to fight wars from the goldsmiths of London, including a group of Jews. And then he refused to pay it back. Now you have a problem because now you have a credit crisis. You have a trust crisis. If the king refuses to pay back the rich for their loan, Why would the king ever be able to raise funds ever again? So parliament solves this problem. Because now if parliament is the central authority, the central sovereignty in the land, then you are not lending money to the king, you are lending money to the nation. If a king dies or a king is deposed, you're screwed, you're not getting your money back. But if you lend money to the nation, the people for the parliament, then you're always guaranteed to get your money back unless England gets conquered, okay? But we know because of the Navy, England cannot be conquered. And so not only are the rich willing to lend money to the nation now to finance wars, but also foreigners, especially the Dutch, right? Because the Dutch were very wealthy and they needed a safe place to put their money. So where's the safest place in the world to put your money now? England, right? Because if you are in the Netherlands, you can be conquered by the French or the Germans, which happens a lot. But if your money, your gold, and this is gold, goes to London, no one's gonna be able to touch that. So now the Bank of England allows Britain to borrow money from its people, from foreigners, and from the future by printing money, by issuing war bonds. And therefore, Britain has infinite financing. And this is a major reason, this is the main reason why Britain was able to defeat Napoleon. It took seven wars, seven coalitions, to defeat Napoleon. Each of these coalitions was financed by Britain. And once Napoleon was defeated, Britain became the hegemon of the world. It became the British Empire. No one could now challenge the might of Britain. Okay, so you understand the impact of central banking. Central banking allows you to mortgage your nation's future in the pursuit of total war. It allows you to weaponize the trust and confidence of your people. Okay, does that make sense? But there's a problem, okay, this is really important. There's a problem with this innovation. The problem is this. Once you commit to a war, once you raise debt and commit to a war, you're forced to fight the war until the very bitter end. Because if you lose the war, your nation goes bankrupt. Does that make sense, guys? That's why Britain refused to ever compromise from Napoleon. Napoleon said to Britain, hey, guys, I control all of Europe. Let's talk peace. Let's just trade peacefully. And Britain says, no, we can't do that because we lent a lot of money to the Austrians, the Prussians, and the Germans, and the Russians in order to defeat you. If we signed a deal of peace, all this money is now gone, and we the Bank of England, we the British nation, is completely wiped out. We are completely wiped out. Okay, do you understand? This is really important for the future history of Europe. If Britain fights a war, it does so through financing. It does so through debt, but because it does so through debt, It has to fight the war until it wins. It can never ever compromise. It can never ever surrender. And this is important because this explains what happened in World War I, World War II, and this also explains, and I'll discuss this towards the end of the semester, it also explains American foreign policy. Okay, was that clear to you guys? Any questions about what we've learned so far? Okay, now I want to talk about political philosophy of the British, okay? Because again, we discussed this throughout this course. You can have new ideas, but now you have to justify these new ideas. You have to explain the innovation through philosophy to the people, okay? So, Britain at this time is really famous for its political philosophers. At this time Thomas Hobbes is one of the most dominant political philosophers. He lived through the English Civil War. He saw all the chaos, all the destruction. And he wrote a book called Leviathan. Leviathan is to justify why Britain returned to monarchy instead of maintaining a commonwealth. And this is the most famous passage from his book, Leviathan, which you'll probably read in university. There is no place for industry because the fruit thereof is uncertain and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor use of commodities that may be imported by sea, no comedia's building, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, Buddhist and short. So he's trying to explain why there's government. And so he gives the idea that we were born in a state of nature. And we're free to do whatever we want. We can kill, we can love, we can steal, we can do whatever we want. So why would we give up this freedom in order to enter a state of nature, in order to have government? And the answer is because state of nature sucks, okay? Because you can be killed because things will be stolen from you because there'll be no innovation. So no matter how bad government is, it's absolutely necessary, okay? Now this is John Locke, okay? And John Locke is writing during the time of the Glorious Revolution. He is a supporter of parliament. He's a supporter of the Glorious Revolution. And he writes something called, so 1688 is the Glorious Revolution. In 1689, he will publish the Second Treatise on government. And this is his most famous work. Again, when you go to university, you will have to study the Second Treatise. But in it, he basically explains that, okay, Hobbes is right. We are born of state of nature and we do need government. But let's remember this. When we're born in a state of nature, we are born with certain inalienable rights. And these three rights are the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of property. And the proper function of government is to maintain our rights. The government does not do that. Then we have the flexibility, we have the freedom to rebel against the government. So Hobbes is saying, government isn't necessary. You can never ever challenge it, because if you do, things will get much worse. Locke is saying, government is only legitimate if it guarantees us our inelible rights. So Locke is considered the founder of liberalism. And his ideas will become the basis for the US Constitution, which we'll study next Thursday. So I want to remember this. All right. Now, what I'm doing now, and this is really important, is compare contrast the British enlightenment with the European enlightenment. Remember before we did the European enlightenment, we studied Wusow, we studied Kant, Voltaire. Okay, and I told you the British enlightenment is very different from the European enlightenment in three major ways. Okay, so now what I will do is explain what the differences are. Okay, all right, so let's compare Wusow and Locke. Locke published his theories at the end of the 17th century. Rousseau comes about 50 years later, okay? And Rousseau will give us a French Revolution. So there are three major differences. I want you to remember between British local philosophy and European local philosophy. Okay, the first is this. Locke believes that we are born tabula rasa, the blank slate, okay? Which means that we are influenced by the environment. If our parents are nice to us, we'll be good people. If our parents are mean to us, we'll become bad people. Tablova Rasa, okay? We are controlled, nurtured by the environment. Rousseau, the Europeans believe no. We are born inherently good. Not only that, we were born with the capacity to reason if we were given the freedom to reason. Remember when we discussed Rousseau, he said, do not educate your child before the age of 12. Because if you do, you just screw up the child. And the idea is there's a natural capacity in us that will grow over time that allows us to reason naturally. So Rousseau believe this, but also Kant believe this as well. So that's a huge difference. Second major difference is this. Law believes the purpose of society is liberty. Liberty just means you are free to do whatever you want. You want to eat ice cream? Go ahead and do it. Yes, ice cream will make you fat, ice cream will maybe increase your cholesterol, but you should have the freedom, the liberty, to make that choice, okay? That's the purpose of society, to give you the liberty to make bad choices. For us all, the purpose of society is reason. Society, if it's good, should enable you to reason properly, okay? So the Europeans believe that society should be much more interventionist. It should help you become more reasonable. This reason is what allows for freedom. OK? The last major difference, and this is key, OK guys? I need you guys to remember these three differences. The last major difference is this. How do you base laws? On what basis do you have laws? OK? And so for law, the answer is very simple. Tradition, guys. It is what we've been doing all this time, right? British common law. If the Romans did it and we're still doing it, it's probably for a reason. It's probably because it works. But for Rousseau and the Europeans, it's general will. Remember, okay, so just to remind you, general will is what is in the best interest of people. Okay, this is really important. It's not what people want. It's what the majority says. It's what is in the best interest of people. So Rousseau talks about this a lot where, Okay, if you let people vote, there's a danger that they'll be influenced by a minority who manipulates them, okay? The idea of the general will is, think about this using your reason. Think about what is in the best interest of everyone. All right, so if everyone's like, I want free ice cream, okay? This entire school says, I want free ice cream, then we should give you free ice cream, according to the law, right? But according to, so, no, we cannot give you ice cream because if you sit down independently and think about what is in your best interest, you would know that ice cream is bad for you. Therefore, we should not give you ice cream, okay? The general rule is what is in the best interest of everyone involved. Not necessarily what you vote for, not necessarily what you believe, but what is in your best interest, okay? If you have reason, if you have the capacity to reason. All right? Now, let's summarize what the difference is. The Europeans always asking what is good, what is right. The British, and then later on the Americans, only ask what works, okay? What works? What is the least worst world we can live in, okay? So the British are practical. You can also say the British are uteritarian, whether Europeans are romantic and they are idealistic. Also, and this is really important because Russo's thinking will give us the philosophies of communism and Nazism. Does that make sense? And of course, Locke's ideas will give us the US Constitution. So this is part of the Anglo-American political tradition. This will not become the European tradition, which will give us Marxism and communism. All right, let's continue. So one of the most important political philosophers in Britain is Jeremy Bentham. He's the founder of something called utilitarianism. So Bentham agrees with Locke that we need a more liberal society. We need a more progressive society. But for him, it's really a question of how do you, mathematically and logically, come to the point where you have a tolerant liberal progressive society? And so he develops the idea of utilitarianism. The idea of eutecto-tertiaryism is there are two principles that govern the universe, that motivate us. There's the pleasure principle and there's the pain principle. And so what he says is, if something makes us happy, it's inherently good. If something makes us feel pain, it's inherently bad. So we should structure a society that mathematically calculates the amount of pain and pleasure we produce, and then we should maximize the pleasure and reduce the pain. And if you do that, then you get to the same point of lock where people should be guaranteed liberty. People should be allowed to do whatever they want, as long as it doesn't really harm other people. You want to eat ice cream, go eat ice cream. You're not harming anyone. Obviously there are lots of issues with this theory of euthanism. So along comes his disciple, John Stuart Mill. And John Stuart Mill is considered the most significant political philosopher of the past 200 years. He is the founder of what we call classical liberalism. The very basis of classical liberalism is people should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Also, people should be allowed to say whatever they want because free debate, free open debate, is what allows society to progress. So what John Stuart Mill does is he takes the principles of euthanism and he finds it in order to explain why classical liberalism is the best philosophy out there. And classical liberalism will include women's rights. It will include prison reform. It will include a more egalitarian society. Okay? Alright. So another thing that Lock, sorry, John Stuart Mill, that's very important is he explains pleasure is not what you think it is. Pleasure isn't like, okay, whatever makes me happy because there are different types of pleasure. There's short-term pleasure and there's long-term pleasure, right? Short-term pleasure is eating ice cream every day. Long-term Short-term pleasure is having a healthy body which allows you to climb mountains, which allows you to enjoy life more. Short-term pleasure is just watching TikTok videos. Long-term pleasure is being able to reach Shakespeare, being able to read Dante, and being able to enjoy life more. So that is this major refinement of Bentham. Because you enjoy something today doesn't mean it's good for you. So we have the capacity to understand their short term pleasure and there's long term pleasure. Okay? Long term pleasure is what he refers to as happiness. The purpose of life is to be happy. It's not necessarily to seek pleasure, but the purpose is to seek happiness. Okay? All right. So this is a very rough introduction. You will learn all the stuff when you get to university, okay? All right, so these are the reasons why the British Empire came to conquer the world, okay? It's history, it's geography, it's demographics. Forces it to engage in a continuous series of innovation. This innovation will allow it to eventually dominate the entire world. And even though the British Empire is gone, we still have to comment on the British commonwealth. So these are nations that speak English, that believe British culture is the best in the world and who believe that working together in a community will be beneficial for all, okay? The British Commonwealth, okay? And that's a legacy we still have of the British Empire. Okay, so now that I've done a brief introduction, what I'm gonna do now is summarize the main points so that you have a pretty clear framework to work with as we progress into the American Empire. Okay? All right. So what I'm going to do now is just summarize what we've learned into a story of the British Empire. So what's this clear to you guys? So let's now just summarize what we've learned. All right. So there are many, many reasons why the British Empire came to dominate the world. But the three things I want to highlight today is the Royal Navy. So the thing to remember about the Royal Navy is its main purpose is actually not to engage in war and conquest. Its main purpose is actually to maintain global trade. Why? Because remember, Britain is the first nation to industrialize. Therefore, it's producing a lot of finished goods. If you have finished goods, you need markets. So the British Navy, its main purpose is to open up new markets. and they do maintain safe trade routes against pirates to facilitate global trade. And this, of course, made Britain extremely wealthy. Second major reason is the Bank of England. I cannot stress enough how important this innovation was. Also what's really important, first remember, is the Bank of England was private. Private. So we have the powers of a central bank, the power to print money, issue currency, the power to issue debt, sell bonds, but it was private, meaning it was controlled by rich stockholders. And the reason why they did this is it was just the easiest way in order to raise money quickly. That makes sense, right? Because if you're a public person, you may not want to give your money to the government, but you're a rich person, where are you gonna put your money? You're gonna put your money into a central bank, that's supported by the government, okay? All right. And the third major reason is English. All right, so the development of English, which is, again, the world's easiest language to learn. So most languages, in order to speak it well, You actually have to grow up in a place, right? So you want to speak Chinese very well, then the best solution is to be born in China. But English is different. English is, you can learn at any age and still have a pretty good command of the language. That's a huge innovation in human history. So now let's sort of figure out why was England able to achieve these three major innovations, okay? And not other places, okay? The first principle is the idea of open cooperative competition, which I will explain, okay? Second is the idea of creative destruction, meaning the elite is being constantly replaced by a new elite that brings in new ideas. And the third is expansion, okay? So clone expansion, where the British or the English are forced to migrate overseas instead of Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and other places as well. But permanently these places. So these are the three major factors that drive innovation. And because of all this constant process of innovation you have, Britain developed a navy, a bank, and a new language that is fairly easy to learn. All right, really quickly I'm gonna discuss idea of open cooperative competition. All right, so historically, civilization developed on a major river. So if you look at China, China developed on the Yangtze. Egypt developed on the Nile. Mesopotamia developed on the Tigris and Euphrates. India developed on the Inez Valley and the Ganges. Why? Because if you have a major river, you can build a settlement. And then for irrigation, you can expand your population. And once your population expands, it will allow you to colonize other areas. And then your population keeps on growing before it becomes a dominant civilization in an area. Does that make sense? Britain is different and Europe is different. Why? Because there are no major rivers. And therefore the population is constant. You never have a need to go conquer new territory. You just want to protect your own territory. But because the population is so diffuse and limited, it allows for foreign conquest, which allows for great destruction. And that's the main factor driving innovation in Britain. So that's the history of the British Empire. Any questions? Anything you guys are not clear about? So feel free to ask any questions, okay? But like, please make sure you guys understand the logic of this, because we're gonna build on this as we go further and further into the present, okay? And remember, this is being influenced by the Dutch, who will now, and then these ideas will then go on to influence the Americas, okay? So America basically just takes all the ideas of the British Empire for itself, all right? So it's really important you understand what's driving the British Empire? Sure, the Puritans. Okay, all right guys, all right. So let's go into, so the question is, what's the difference between the Puritans and the Pilgrims, okay? Let's go into the problem of religion in England at this time, okay? So when you have a diversity, okay, you have diversity in England. And so even though England is a small place, as I keep on saying, a lot of control is localized. So if you cross from one village to the next, the culture can be very different. So this is a feudal system. They have a lot of diversity. So this diversity is gonna impact your religious outlook. So what's gonna happen is this. So England is Catholic. And then Henry VIII is going to turn this into the Church of England. But then, what's going to happen is you all have new ideas, basically Calvinism, come in from Europe. Why is Calvinism important? Because England is the first to industrialize. It's the first to have a middle class. It's the first to have merchants. Merchants prefer Calvinism to Catholicism. And in the Catholic religion, you to give all your money to the church, but in a Calvinist religion, you have to keep your money for yourself. So Calvinism is a much more popular religion in Britain than the Catholic religion in England as England begins to industrialize. And so the middle class is rising in power. And the problem is the response to the Church of England. The Church of England, it's not Catholic, but it's using a lot of Catholic principles. And the Calvinists, the people of the Calvinists is their fanatics, okay? They believe everyone should be a Calvinist, everyone should believe in hard work, everyone should be like us. And the Pope is evil. So the Calvinists are not very tolerant. So there are two major responses to the Church of England. There's the idea of reform and then there's the idea of dissolution. So the idea of reform is, look, the Church of England, it's fine, but there are certain things within the Church of England, which is too much of a Catholic Church. So if we get rid of these things, we'll be good. So but within the reform movement, you have different factions as well. So there are some who want to replace the governance structure of the Church of England because the Church of England is controlled by the king. And they believe, no, we should all be obedient to God, not the king, so that They want to destroy the hierarchy, the governance. There are some who want everyone to read the Bible. There are some who want to change the nature of the priesthood. OK, so there are different theories of change. And these group of people we call the Peritons. But then you have a minority who are extremely violent and fanatical, and they believe, no. Let's just get rid of the Church of England period, because there should be no earthly authority before God. These people we call separatists. And they will become the pilgrims, because obviously the king will persecute these people. They will feel the king sees them as a threat, and they will be persecuted. They'll be outlawed. A lot of them will be executed. So a lot of them will flee to America in order to practice their religion, in order to found a new religion. So the pilgrims are the ones who flee. the pyrrhodians are the ones who will stay and eventually engage in the Civil War and over for the king. But remember this, okay? While this is happening, while this is happening, this is really important. There's also a counter reaction, okay? So there are these Catholics who want to return England into the Catholic fold. And they're, so Scotland is very Catholic, okay? You also have other people called the Armenians who want to maintain the Church of England as it is. So you have all these massive factions emerging and they're all in conflict over religion. And religion is a proxy for economic class as well. So it's obviously the middle class who support reform. There are a lot of nobles who support the Catholic religion. And the king is primarily a sympathizer of the Catholic religion. So during the Cold War Revolution, they will make a stipulation that no king can ever be a Catholic. And that's a way to limit the power of the king. Because you're a Catholic king, you can draw on the French, the Vatican, the Spanish as allies in your suppression of the nobles and of the middle class of parliament, okay? So there's a fear that the king will ally with the Catholic in order to destroy the authority of parliament. And so after the Glorys Revolution, a major reform is the king cannot be Catholic. And in fact, if you're here to the throne, but if the parliament suspects you have Catholic sympathies, they will replace you with someone else. Parliament has that power. And they did that actually during its history. So there's a deep fear of the Catholic religion within the among English people. But as you can see, this is a very complicated process that will take about 20 years to fully play out. Does that make sense? What's really important for us to remember is this conflict is being through the pilgrims, is now migrating to America. And these people will make America into the most religious, fanatical, intolerant place on Earth, in certain places in America. And it's a tradition that still continues today. There are some parts of America that are extremely tolerant, like New York City and Los Angeles. But hey, go to, I don't know, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas. They're not very tolerant people. And you can make the argument that they are the most fanatical people in the whole world, much more so than the Jews, much more so than the Muslims. So does that answer your question? Great. Any more questions? That's a great question. So how much power does a king have? So the thing about the British is because it's a system based on tradition, there's There's a lot of flexibility built into the system. So depending on the person, the king, the king can have a lot of power. So for example, Henry VIII was a very powerful king. And can you see one of the most powerful kings in the world? Why? First of all, because he was a huge guy. He was extremely charismatic. He was a huge guy that was very good at winning friends with the nobles. So he was very good at building alliances. Also, he was in power for a long, long time, over 50 years. So he was able to slowly insert his prodigies, his minions, into businesses of authority. And also, he was also very popular because he took England away from the Catholic Church. So the public king, it's not written down. And a lot of his power has to do with his personality, his longevity, his alliances, his charisma. So there are a lot of different factors in place. And that's why the British think their constitution, it's the most perfect in the world. Because it's not written down, so they're not actually constrained by words. But there's traditions that allow the constitution to be living, to be flexible, and to be pertinent to the present. And so the English are actually proud of their constitution. Does that make sense? Okay, so that's a great question. So if these pilgrims went over to America, how was America able to become this multicultural empire? Because that goes against a lot of peritonical teachings. And the answer, which we'll discuss next week is, America is a coalition of conflicts. of conflicts, okay? It is a melting pot of differences, okay? So what I will teach you next Thursday when we do the American Revolution is there are two dominant strands in the founding of America. There's the pilgrim strand, which is paritanical, which is like let's create a theocracy, but there's also a enlightenment strand where they believe that they are founding a new empire based on reason. And so the religion we use for them is deism. These are dias. And most of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Axon Hamilton, George Washington, were dias. They wanted to found a tolerant, multicultural empire. So these are two dominant strengths in America. And quite honestly, what's really important is, if you want to understand what's happening in America today, Donald Trump, right? You need to understand that it's these two strands that have always been present in America that are now coming to conflict with each other. Because you have on the left these multiculturalists, like Barack Obama, who believe that America is great because America welcomes immigrants. And you have people like JD Vance, and there are lots of others as well, who on the conservative side, who say, no America is great because we are Christian. Because we have this tradition of Christianity. That's what makes us great. And right now we're losing our Christianity due to multiculturalism, and therefore we must close our borders. Therefore we must reassert the Christian faith in our nation, okay? So we will discuss this next Thursday when we do America, but as this course progresses, I will show you how complicated America is and show you that because of this conflict, America's plight is probably headed towards a civil war. Okay? If that makes sense to you. All right. Great. Any more questions, guys? Okay. So next class, we'll do one Shakespeare. And then after one Shakespeare, we'll do the American Revolution. Okay?"}

Welcome to our first class. And today what I want to do is provide the framework for how we will learn the semester. What are we learning? How are we learning? Why are we learning? Alright, so this is a class of ideas. So it's really important for you to pay attention and understand how these ideas connect with each other. If I'm not being clear, ask me a question. In fact, make it a habit to ask as many questions as possible because that way you will learn more, learning will be more fun for you and learning will be much more clearer to you, okay? So it's gonna have it all, asking questions. So wherever I am confusing, wherever I'm speaking too fast, wherever you don't understand, interrupt me, okay? Let's get in the habit. All right, so I first want to talk about Emmanuel Kant. We will be discussing him a lot this semester because he is the greatest philosopher in Western history. And he teaches us, he taught us how the world works. And this is what he told us. He told us that we can never know the objective reality. There is an objective reality, what he calls the nomina, okay? Or the things in themselves. That is not knowable to us. That's a world we can never access. Why? Because we perceive the world through our senses. Our senses, our perception warps the world and changes it into a structure that we can process called the phenomena, which are the things that appear to us. Okay, so the example is time and space. Time and space do not exist outside of us. Time and space do not exist in reality. But for us to understand reality, we need to add in time and space. And that's the example. All right? So, how the word works is we perceive the world, we perceive the phenomena and turn it into the phenomena for us to process. In other words, and this is really important, reality is what we imagine it to be. There is no objective reality. Reality is what we imagine it to be. Life is a constant process, a constant act of imagination. All right, that's a manual con. That's the first idea I want you to understand. So what I wanna do in this class this semester is train you or teach you or inspire you to augment your imagination so that you see the world much more clearly. This class is not about what to think. It's about how to think. All right, all right. So let me explain the structure of the course. So there's past, there's present, and there's future. We'll be looking at all three this semester, the past, the present, and the future. We will be analyzing all three in order to construct a more objective reality for ourselves. We will not succeed, we will fail, but the process of trying will train our minds to think much more critically about the world. So, let me explain how. In the present, we have geopolitics. When we're studying geopolitics, for example, why is there war in Ukraine? Why is there war in the Middle East? will be studying geopolitics. And we'll try to understand why this is happening. We'll try to formulate an analytical model of geopolitics, okay, an analytical model. We will then use this analytical model to make predictions about the future. Why do we do this? Because these predictions will tell us if our analytical model is correct or not. Does that make sense? It's no different from artificial intelligence. How do you know if your artificial intelligence, the model is correct or not? When you test it against reality. There's no difference between that artificial intelligence system and what we're trying to do here. And why are we doing this? Because if we're able to have an actual model that makes correct predictions, Then we take all this and go back and analyze the past to reveal the secret history of the world. That is a project we are undertaking this semester to discover for ourselves the secret history of humanity. Because you may not know this, but all the history that you learned in school Well, that history that you think you know, it is false. The history that you know, the history that you believe, it is a system implanted into your brains by powerful people. So the real question that we're looking at this semester is really how does power work? Because if we can figure this out, then you will achieve liberation, you will achieve freedom. You understand how you're being manipulated by others and therefore you'll be free, you'll be empowered to live the way you want to live, to see the world that is true to you. So let me give you three correct examples of how power works. Okay, the first example is money. Let us do a thought experiment. I'm a bank, okay? I decide I want to open a bank. And now you're allowed to put money in the bank, okay? So all of you get together and you put $5 million in the bank, not $5 million. Now, why do you put $5 million into my bank? because I promise you 1% interest, right? 1% interest. That's a really good deal. But now, because I owe you some money, right? I owe you 1% interest, I now need to go make money for myself. So I have a friend who's building a restaurant and he says I need $5 million to build a restaurant and after a year, I will pay back 10% interest. Okay? 10% interest. And so I make a 9% profit and I can use that to pay my employees, to pay myself a salary, to build a new building, okay? So now I want you to think about this. On the bank, I got $5 million in deposit money, then I gave out a $5 million loan. Today, how much money is in the bank? How much money now do I have? I got $5 million from you guys, then I give it out to someone else. Right? So how much money is in the bank right now? Zero, right? It should be zero. Logically, the answer is zero. In fact, zero is the answer that you are taught in economics. It's what you are taught, yeah? Zero is not the answer to the politics. Okay. You cannot loan all the money that you have. For example, they will have a limit of 25%. I don't know. Maybe 10% so you can only loan like 4 million dollars. OK, OK, yeah. OK, really good point. OK, yes. OK, so that's really good. So in economics, you learn about the idea of the fractional reserve system. OK? What's fractional reserve? As you say, you must leave behind a certain amount of money. It can be 7%. It can be 10%. Depends on the country. OK? Let's say 10%. So theoretically, I can actually lend out $5 million. I'm gonna lend out $4.5 million, okay? You're right, okay? That's law as well, okay? Actually, okay, let's say I lent out $4.5 million, okay? Now how much money do I have in the bank? Yeah, half a million, right? So again, this is what you're taught in economics. This is what makes logical sense, right? The correct answer, what actually happens in real life is you now have $9.5 million. That is the correct answer. This makes no sense, right? But it happens in reality. And how do we know? Because over the past 20 years, Chinese banks, like the Bank of China, the Bank of Industry and Commerce, the Agricultural Bank of China. If you Google these banks, what you will see is these past 20 years, these banks have become the largest in the world. How did that happen? Was it because Chinese people got rich and put all the money in the bank? No, that's not what happened. What happened, guys? What happened was these banks start to lend money out to corporations, to government, to people to build skyscrapers, to build roads. In other words, the banks start to create money out of nothing in order to finance China's infrastructure projects. And that's what banks are allowed to do. They're allowed to print money, create money out of nothing. Okay, does that make sense? Now the question then is, wait a minute here, That's kind of absurd how this system come into being. How is it created? Okay, well actually there's a very easy explanation for where we got the system from. All right, so let me explain the history and the origin of the system. So in the beginning, it was merchants who engaged in finance, because merchants needed money in order to facilitate trade. And some merchants became extremely wealthy. And when they became very wealthy, they started banks in order to support trade and other merchants. OK, so these banks traded in gold because that was the primary source and supply of money back there. So what happened is you would come and you would put your money, your gold in the bank for safekeeping. and the bank would give you a contract, right? A contract is just saying, thank you for giving me your gold. I promise to give back your gold at any time that you want it. And that's what we call a receipt, right? And this would allow for better and easier trade. Because now I can take this contract And I can go to England. OK, maybe I'm based in Italy. But now I can go to England and say, listen, I need to buy cotton or bananas from you. And the person is like, well, what do you give me? I'm going to give you gold, right? So I take the receipt and I give it to you, right? And why do we do this? Because it's a lot easier than giving gold to other people. And so this system would facilitate trade throughout the world. Doesn't make sense. Now, I'm the bank. I have all this gold. And I want to make money with it. So I want to give it to other people. So other merchants would come to me and say, listen, I need gold. Can you lend me out gold? But I say to him, yeah. But if I give you out the gold, you have a security issue. It's inconvenient for you. So why don't I give you a receipt, a contract instead? Does that make sense? Because all I need is a contract, all I need is a receipt in order to go and do trade elsewhere, right? So by doing this, what I've done is I've doubled the gold in my bank, right? I've created money out of nothing. So the gold is still five million. That hasn't changed, but the receipt is now five million plus five million. So theoretically, I now have 10 million in the bank. All right? So that's how money and finance works. Now there's a problem with the system. What's the problem with the system? What do you mean? Okay, that's a good question, okay? Why is it that people believe in me? Okay, the answer is very simple. The answer is because for most of human history, People didn't need money. If you were just a normal person, what were you doing? Were you in a village growing crops? If you wanted to get new stuff, what would you do? You would trade with someone else, right? Maybe you have a goal that I want. Well, then I would trade you a cow for it. So we didn't actually need money. So for most of human history, no one had any need for money. It was only in certain circumstances that you would want money. So for example, marriage, right? So for most of human history, money represented debt that could be unpaid. So debt that could never be repaid. So for example, a very common thing is maybe you and I fight and I kill you. Well, in theory, your family should not come and kill me. But obviously, that would create a lot of problems, right? So the way to settle this dispute is I would give your family money because money was symbolically meant to say, I'm sorry, I killed you. This is a debt that can never be repaid. That's what money was used for in most circumstances throughout human history. There was no actually real use for money, it was symbolic. But with the rise of trade over merchants, they needed money in order to facilitate the trade. But these merchants all knew each other. So they trusted each other anyway. So money was a mechanism for them to trade easier. Does that make sense? All right. So let's go back to the question. This system looks great. I can print money out of nothing. But there's a problem with this system. What is the problem? There's a problem here. Hmm? You can pull it to the seats. OK, that's actually a great question. So yeah, is it possible to forge the contract? So that's a really good point. The problem is, so the answer is that they all knew each other anyway. Because it's a very small circle. Again, we have not reached the modern period where it's a lot of people using money. And that's the case, then fortune becomes a problem. We'll discuss this in future classes, counterfeiting. But at this point in history, fortune is actually not a big issue. There's actually a bigger issue. And it's a huge issue. What's the issue? I have $5 million of gold, right? There's about $10 million of gold out there in receipts. What's the problem with that? The problem is that if everyone wants to go at the same time, I go bankrupt, right? Because I lose my reputation. The contract says that at any time you want the gold, I must give it to you. But if I have like, if there's $100 million in gold contracts, but I only have $10 million in gold, only if 15 million wants the gold back, then I'm screwed. If this is what we call a bank run, a bank run. And this is a huge problem for merchants. There's also another problem with the system. And the problem is this. Who do I usually lend my money to? Do you guys know? If I'm a bank, if I'm a merchant, who do I usually lend my money to? Okay guys, today we lend the money to entrepreneurs. But back then, they really weren't entrepreneurs. They were kings and noble people. And what did they do all the time? Why did they need money? To fight wars, okay? That's why there's a demand for gold. Because if I'm a king, I need to fight a war. Usually it gets my brother or someone else to control this territory, right? Now the problem with this is I could get killed, in which case, oops. But also, what's much more common is the king would be like, screw you, Bank. I don't need to pay you back, okay? So there's actually a lot of risk with this system. So for a time, develop a system to mitigate or reduce this risk, okay? What would they do? What they would do is they would create cartels. Cartels are just partnerships. So maybe this bank works with a little bank, works with a little bank throughout Europe. And the way they establish these cartels is usually through intermarriage, right? They would marry each other, they would combine together. And that way, let's say 15 million of receipts wants back the gold, but there's only 10 million. Well, guess what? You just go to another bank, okay? And let's just say a king decides, I'm not gonna pay you back bank. Well, your bank works with other banks to establish a new enemy to kill the king to get the money back. Do you understand? And this system is what we call today central banking. And what you will learn in this class is central banking controls the world today. Okay? Now what's really important about this system is that it's based on power. And what power is, you can turn nothing, money, the contract into everything. That's what money is. OK, so we live in a world in which banks can print out money. So now let's ask ourselves a question. Wait a minute here. If the banks can print as much money as possible, Why do we have poverty? Because we can just give money to poor people and they won't be poor anymore. Why do we have poverty? If there's all the food in the world that we want, why are people starving still? Why? So we don't have limited resources, we have scarcity, okay? So that is the common answer, scarcity. We have poverty because of scarcity. But I already told you this. They can put money out of nothing. So money is infinite. Money is an infinite resource. So why do we have poor people then? That's kind of strange. We just use a trade. They still have limited resources in the actual need. Like the actual needs. You see what's happening is this. You all believe money is scarce, okay? I just spent the past 10, 20 minutes explaining to you, It's not scarce. It's infinite. Because it's just a number. We can at any time print out as much money as we need. So that's how power works. Power has brainwashed you. You're thinking something that is not true. You've been taught from the first day that money is scarce. But it's not scarce. It's infinite. And no matter what I say to you, you still believe this. So you have to get that out of your head. Money is not scarce, it is infinite. So let's write a good question. Why is there poverty in this world? Why do people starve? Why is there inequality in this world? Why are there poor people? Why are there rich people? What's the answer? Because they don't. Okay. Because it's scarce. So guys, this is amazing, okay? You guys can't get out of your head. You think money is scarce. You think it is not possible to print infinite money When I already told you it is possible to print infinite money because they do this all the time. Yeah? I don't want to share the same. Yeah, because we don't want people to all have money. The powerful people don't want that. That's the exact answer. And why? Because otherwise no one would work. Do you understand? The point of putting money is not to give you money. The point of putting money is to create the illusion that money is valuable and therefore you work hard in order to obtain it. But in order for me to make you want to get money, I need to create artificial misery. You understand? If there weren't poor people, you wouldn't want to be rich. It's only because you see people suffer that you would want to go make money for yourself. What do your parents tell you? Your parents tell you, work hard in school, make a lot of money, otherwise you're gonna end up like a poor person. Right? Well, guess what? If you know poor people, your parents couldn't say that to you. And you wouldn't wanna work hard in school. Right? That's why we have poverty. Because poverty creates the illusion that money is valuable. In other words, poverty isn't what you do to yourself, It is what the powerful do to you. Now let me ask you another question. You guys have studied some economics. Why do you have like crises? Crises, for example, there's a stock market crash. Or for example, the economy goes down and people lose their jobs. Why do you have crises? Exactly, you're not taught this in economics class. That's kinda weird, right? The point of crises is to destroy money. Why do we need to destroy money? Because if there's too much money in the system, People don't have to work. So you have to destroy this money in order to make people feel money is scarce. Okay, does that make sense? So why do we have wars? Right, why are there wars in the world then? Because they're fighting over scarce resources, right? I already told you, scarcity is a lie. The real reason is war is meant to destroy wealth in order to make you think money is valuable. Do you understand? You guys play War of Warcraft or these games, right? Guess what guys, what a Warcraft in our world? There's absolutely no difference. You just run around pointlessly working hard to obtain credits in order to buy stuff. If the credits just flew out of the sky because they could do that, right? They could actually program the engine to just put money out of nothing. You wouldn't do nothing every day. You wouldn't play the game, okay? It's only because you believe that there's scarcity in the world and that you must work hard to obtain wealth that you do any work. Do you understand this? So this world that we live in, it's a complete illusion created by central banking in order to make us work as hard as possible. Because the real value is that money. The real value is the work we do. Does that make sense, guys? All right, yeah? The woman said, you said scarcity is an illusion, right? But I understand that money can be printed infinitely, but resources such as food and land, they are technically unlimited. So scarcity, the scarcity still exists in other resources. Okay, that's a great question. Okay, so question is, isn't food scarce? Because food is a finite resource, right? Do yourself a favor, okay? Go to the garbage dump somewhere, anywhere in Beijing, and see the amount of food that is wasted every single day. If food was scarce, why do we have food waste? So if you just do the mathematics, what you will discover is there's not food to feed everyone. There doesn't have to be hunger and starvation. It's an artificial crisis. It doesn't make sense. So you're right in that, yeah, the food's at infinite, But it's abundant. There's a lot of it. Enough to feed people. Okay? It's the reason they got to move. Okay, all right. So again, you guys are stuck in the scarcity mindset. And it's very convincing. So let's move on, okay? So this is something that we'll go back to later on. Because I cannot convince you today, this morning, that everything you believed about the world about yourself is wrong. Okay, you're still stuck there. Like, okay, they're scarcity and you're right, they're scarcity, but we also live in a world of abundance. Okay, and a lot of things that you believe are just misconceptions about the world. Okay, so we'll go back there, okay, later on. So let's move on. Okay, so we've done money now, right? Now let's do another question. Let's do a question of happiness. The question for us today is, what makes us happy? Come on, what makes you happy? How can you live a happy life? Well, obviously money, right? You have a lot of money, that's gonna make you happy. What else? Exactly, power, right? Sure, power, excuse me? Okay, good, freedom. Yeah, what else? Relationships, yep, sure. You have good friends, right? Like lots and lots of friends. What else? Okay, love, right? Love, sure. What else? Like video games, I guess. Vacations, okay? Lots and lots of things, okay? What you will discover about this list is this. You are thinking about individual happiness. This is actually unique in human history. If you were to go back in time five years ago, And you ask people, how can you be happy? They would focus more on collective happiness. In other words, if your community were not happy, you cannot be happy. So the very idea of the individual is new in human history. Before we understood that if you want to live a happy life, you need to take care of your family. You need to take care of your community. For them, for us, for most of human history, happiness meant helping others, being generous to others. So for example, let's just say that I go off and I wonder and then I find a lot of gold, right? I come back and what's the first thing I do with all this gold? Do you guys know? And this is like the ancient past. Take a whole lot of them inside. Okay, yeah, good, right? We're gonna dig a hole and put that money inside because we wanna give to our children. That's a modern mindset. But what did they do before? And this happened throughout every society. If I became rich one day, what's the first thing I would do? Hmm? No, okay. So we'll learn this, okay? But the first thing that people did was they had a big feast for everyone. They spent all the money on a big feast Because what mattered was your reputation within the community. What mattered was your generosity. If you got rich one day, you made sure that everyone in the community benefited from your wealth, usually by holding a big feast. And guess what, guys? This was true in China for most of Chinese history. If you come from a Chinese village, come to Beijing, you open a restaurant, you make a lot of money, you go out to your village. What's the first thing you do? Come on guys. You have a big feast for everyone. So this is ingrained in us, OK? But as you say, today what we believe is if you have a lot of money, put it underground or put in a bank, OK? But back then, for most of human history, we would just spend it all on a big feast. We want to share in happiness. And that's what made us happy, OK? Any questions? Yeah? You mentioned that it was for reputation on some levels without counting into your individual practice because after you get rich, you care about your reputation. Okay. Yeah, so you're asking, is this about individual reputation? And again, I mean, this is hard, okay? But the individual, the concept of individual did not exist before. We just created it. The idea that I'm a person independent of my family, independent of my community, independent of the world around me makes no sense. What was the worst punishment that could be inflicted on you in the past? Let's just say that we're gonna fight, I kill you, right? They say that you are no longer belong to this family. Exactly, banishment, exile. Not death, right? And today, if I killed you, the police would come catch me and then kill me. But before, we didn't do that because the worst thing that we could do was exile you. It says you're no longer part of us. You understand? So the constant they leave you did not exist. Right? Okay, so let's move on. All right, so now I'm gonna present two understandings of the world. And you're gonna tell me which understanding you think is correct. The first understanding, we humans don't have agency. We don't have really control. Why? Because there are powerful gods out there. Okay? There are these powerful gods like Apollo, Dionyses. Oh, the problem though is that they are also controlled by other gods that are more powerful like for example, fate, fortune. And then there are these really ancient gods that control the structure of the universe. For example, maybe anger and pride. So you have to know individual agency because there's always a God screwing with you. Okay? You might get rich, but then the God of pride looks at you and says, no, no, no, I need to teach this more to a lesson. So the God comes into me, makes me too arrogant, my screw up. Okay? So we're always being controlled by these forces beyond our understanding. Okay, so that's our first worldview. Second worldview is this. We are synapses that generate memories. We are memories. Our understanding of the world comes from our experience that is controlled by synapses. Synapses come from a combination of DNA and environment. Our genes and our interaction with the environment, our experiences. And what this means is that we can now have control over an individual fate. If you're angry, it's because some experience or some genes made you angry and this anger becomes reinforced in your memories. And therefore, if you do proper therapy, if you do proper reflection, if you do some exercises, you can better control your anger and therefore control your fate, okay? So in the first worldview, there are lots and lots of gods. They're evil and they're random and we have actually no control over our faith. We only hope to get lucky in life and not piss off the gods. In the second worldview, we are only a collection of our memories and we are only synopsis. So we're able to manipulate the memories and the synopsis in a proper way. We can be free of all problems. We can be free of anger. We can be free of hap- of- of depression. We can be free of misery. All right? Let me ask you this question. Which worldview is a more accurate reflection of reality? Obviously, second-hand, right? Because this is neuroscience. Science. Or psychology or psychiatry. This is what you've been taught in school. This is what you all believe. Our entire society structure around this very idea. And what you will learn in this class is, it is completely wrong. It is a fact, it is the first one that is more accurate reflection of reality. The first one gives you more information, gives you a more accurate assessment of how the world really works. Okay? So now let me ask you this question. If the first worldview, And this is what we call polytheism. And polytheism for most of human history was the dominant religion, okay? Now we live in a world where the religion is science. Science is basically religion. So, why do we make this transition? What's the benefit? If you're a powerful person, why would you prefer the second one as opposed to the first one? Why? What's the benefits to powerful people? What does power want to believe the second one but not the first one? Yeah, okay. So the idea of individual responsibility, okay? So then there's more control, okay? It's easier to control people in the system, right? That's the first benefit, what's the second benefit? The second benefit is you will work harder, right? Because in the first system, you're like, you know what, I don't need to go make a lot of money because if I make a lot of money, God to punish me and make me proud. So I'm just going to like enjoy life and take it easy. So in the first, in the second sense of no, no, I've control over my own life. So I need to work hard. So again, the entire point of the system is to make you work as hard as possible because when you work hard, that generates real wealth for the powerful people. Money does nothing. Money just incentivizes you to work hard. So this exists in order to make you work harder. There's one more benefit or there's more benefits, but what's another benefit? Okay, the other benefit is this, powerlessness. It makes you powerless. Why? This system is designed to make you absolutely powerless. Why? Why? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You see again, again, this is how you're brainwashed. You believe one makes you powerless, but that's not correct. Two makes you powerless, why? What's the difference between one and two? Why is it in number two, you're powerless? You're a monster. Okay, so the problem with number two is you are incapable of collective action because you think all the social problems is the individual in you and that society. But number one, you are capable of collective action. And the only way to change the world is through collective action. Does that make sense? This is a really important point. Two is a sign to make you think the source of all your problems is within you. So you should ignore what other people do and think. Doesn't matter to you. And therefore, you're incapable of identifying with other people. You're not capable of collective action. You're not capable of a collective action and you feel really miserable, what you will do is play video games or watch porn all day. Okay, and that's what's happening in society today. Yeah? But in number two, from experience, we would know you should listen to the others if I take others perspectives and not just. So in number two, who has authority? Who do you listen to? You listen to scientists, right? Scientists. a business system was created by scientists to trick you. Okay? This system you think, oh, it's science. Therefore it must be real. Guys, let me give you a piece of advice, okay? If you're ever feeling sad and you are depressed, what should you do? What should you do? What have you been taught to do? If you feel sad, you're depressed, what should you do? Hmm? Okay, yeah, the credit answer is walk around, But that's not what you've been taught, right? What have you been taught to do? Okay, telling your friend to your parent, that's actually really good, right? So walking around, exercising, resting, talking to a friend about your problem, that's all really good. But what have you been taught to do in school? Really. If you are feeling really, really sad, what should you do? You should go talk to a psychiatrist, right? You should talk to a psychologist. And what will he or she do? Okay, well, I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, okay? And you can test it out for yourself. But if you're feeling sad and you are feeling depressed and you feel you have to talk to a psychiatrist and you do so, I will make you bet that the psychiatrist will make it a lot worse. You will feel worse after talking to a psychiatrist. Okay? And the reason why is the system is not designed to cure you of any problems. The system is to make you dependent on authority. You know that if you feel sad, well, you don't want just go for a walk, talk to a friend, you'll feel better over time. But the system teaches you, no, if you feel sad, go talk to a psychiatrist who will give you drugs. It's designed to make you dependent on authority, yeah? I won't tell us like in scenario one, in real number one, wouldn't God also be an authority? God will also be an authority. That's actually a great question, okay? That is authority. Okay, that's actually a great question. Thank you so much. So I have to spend time to explain to you both systems and I will do so. But what's really important about number one is the gods are really bad people. Okay? The gods in number one, the polyphonic system, they fight all the time. They're vengeful. They're angry. They're proud. but because you're God, they can get away with it. And that's the difference between humans and gods. We're all the same. We're all angry, we're all jealous, we all fight, okay? But the gods can get away with it. Humans cannot. Gods can do hubris, we cannot do hubris. You understand? So the idea that, oh, the people in power are benevolent. the people in power or authority figures who are after our best interests. That is a new modern concept. Before it was assumed that the king is a king. Why? Because he's favored by the gods. It's not because he's a good person. It's not because he's a just ruler. It's just because the gods like him for whatever reason. But guess what? The gods give and the gods take. Maybe today the king will rule us, but maybe five years from now he gets unlucky and they got to kill him. Too bad. If you re-click mythology and we'll do so in this class, okay, we'll go over into Greek civilization. We'll look at Ithapus. We'll look at Homer, the Iliad, okay? They talk about this all the time. Fate is something that you cannot control, it's something that happens to you. And therefore, you must live life to your best. All right? So the difference is this. The difference is in number one, They have a concept called eudaimonia. If you have no control over your fate, if things can happen to you tomorrow, like kill you, then live your life to the best of your ability today. Seize the day. Be the best that you can be today. And that's how you win favor from the gods. Eudaimonia, what we call flourishing. The point of life is to live it to the best of your ability. And that's why, guess what guys, the ancients, the Greeks, they were superior to us. If you read Greek literature, if you read Greek philosophy, Plato, Homer, Isilis, Yuridis, they were the best. Today we suck. Why? Because instead of eudaimonia, we have pleasure. Rather than flourish as creative people We're like, how do I enjoy my life today? How do I not feel sad? Okay? So in the first system, even though it sounds like we have no control, we have no agency, but it inspires us to live to the best of our ability. In the second system, we're like, oh, you have complete control of your life. It enslaves us. All right, now let's move on to the third and final example. And I know this is shocking, I know this is surprising, But over the course of the semester, I will give you enough evidence to convince you that this is all true, okay? I'm just setting up the structure in the framework today. All right, let's do now the school. Guys, why do we have school? Why are we in school? Why? Why are you here? What? Some place, learn and teach. Exactly, right, learn. What else? Yeah, to get the degree, okay? Get the degree, get to graduate. What else? Knowledge, yes. Hm? The power of a chest to brainwash the students. Excuse me? I feel like giving the power of a chest to brainwash others. Brainwashing. Okay, guess what guys? The correct answer is brainwashing. Everything else is a lie. Okay, all right. When you're in school, you come to class, You listen to a lecture, you read books, right? And then you have to do a test, and you have to write a paper. And then the teacher gives you a grade. That's how you learn, right? Let me ask you this question then. Throughout most of human history, how did we learn? If you want to become a doctor, what did you do? The answer is experience, do it. Let me ask you this question. Let's say you're 12 years old, you're a doctor, okay? There are two paths ahead of you. The first path is, you know what? I'm just putting you in a hospital, and you're gonna learn there for like 10 years. Someone's gonna mentor you. Someone's gonna be that person's apprentice. Maybe in the first year, all you do is like wash the floor. Okay, but you're gonna observe the doctor, and then eventually the doctor's going in to tell you how to treat patients. Okay, that's the first system. Second system is you go to the best school in the world, then you go to Harvard for undergraduate. So you go to Harvard Medical School, the best medical school in the world. Okay, age 30, who's about a doctor, number one or number two? Obviously the first one, right? Because the second person, the person who went to Harvard and Harvard Medical School, did not ever work in a hospital. You understand? Now let me ask you another question. In the first system, do you have to be really, really smart to be a good doctor? You don't actually. Anyone can be a doctor in the first system. Anyone. We human beings are all born with the capacity to learn anything. If you wanted to learn it, right? You'll be an engineer. You'll be a lawyer. If you wanna be a doctor, if you'll be a scientist, you'll be anything, okay? Just go find a mentor who can teach you how to do so. And I guarantee you that you will learn how to do it well. And anyone can do this. But instead, we have a system in which we tell students, you're smart, you're stupid. Smart students go to good schools and good universities, and they get good jobs. Stupid students go wash dishes. And that was not true for most of human history. It's true today, but for most of human history, you want to go learn something, all you had to do was go find a teacher. And that teacher would teach you. And then you would learn it, right? So school is not a place to teach you how to learn. A school doesn't teach you knowledge. It doesn't do that. A school is a place that brainwashes you, okay? Now the question then is, what does it brainwash you in? What would it brainwash you? Okay, all right, to answer that, I'm going to give you some history, okay? We will do a lot of history in this class. But I'm gonna tell you the three societies that first introduce mandatory free public schooling in the world, okay? The first is called Sparta, okay? Sparta was a small city-state in Greece, like 3, 4,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago. And they had a new system in which children as early as five or six years old, they were put into a school. And in the school, they were being up by older kids who were like nine or 10. Okay. That's Sparta. The second society was called the X text, ass texts. And they also provided free compulsory education to all its children. Really good, right? And the third society is called Prussia. And actually Prussia is a system that everyone uses today. Do you guys know any history? What is common about all three societies? Sparta, Aztecs, and Prussia. What is common to all three? War. All three societies are fundamentally war societies dedicated to defeating their neighbors. Sparta was one of thousands of city-states in Greece. The only society of these thousands that had compulsory education. Why? Because Sparta was first and foremost engaged in war-making. Sparta, you've heard of Spartans, right? It's the Spartan warrior, okay? The Aztecs were the greatest war society in Central America before the arrival of the Europeans. They defeated everyone. They were engaged in war. They also did a lot of human sacrifices as well. We learn about the Aztecs later on. Prussia, the Prussians, the greatest military in Europe for centuries, they were engaged in war making as well. Okay, do you understand this? Why we have schools is because schools are really good at preparing people for war. Why? Excuse me? They have people under, they have, they teach some things, how to do, and so on. What is, what is, why, let me ask you this question. Why did they not have schools before? Why isn't that people were like, we don't want schools, why? Again, the Sparta Aspects and Pressure with a few societies that had free public schooling. Why didn't other societies just copy them? Why? Let me ask you this question. Let's just say you're a mother or a father. What's the, and you have a child, right? What's the worst thing that could happen in your life? Hmm? No, no, your mother or your father, you have a child, right? What's the worst thing that can happen to you in your life? Your child is taking away from you, right? What does school do? School is designed to take your child away from you. Okay? Let me ask you this question. If school is about learning, why don't parents and children go to school together? Yeah, why not? Why? Because parents have to work to survive, right? There's actually a better reason why. Yeah, it's about brainwashing, right? Because how do you brainwash someone? Right? If you're with your parent, are you brainwashed? No. Because you feel love. You feel secure. Your parents are going to protect you. You're not your parent. Hey, is this teacher, is he or she lying to me? And the parent's like, yeah, he's lying to you, okay? It's only because you've been taken away from your parent that you are now willing to be brainwashed. Why? Because what happens if you leave your parents? How do you feel? How do you feel? Hmm? Yeah, exactly, right? Instacure, you're anxious, you're afraid. You understand? You've lost your parent. You're four, you're five, you're six years old. You've lost your parent. You feel really insecure. So who do you trust? Your teacher. What if your teacher says is now correct? They went to school before our parents. Yeah, okay. That's a great point, okay? Aren't our parents brainwashed as well? That's correct. Your parents are brainwashed. But what I'm saying is when a parent is with a child, the child feels secure. And if you're secure, You're much more willing to disobey authority. You're much willing to ask questions. You're much willing to think for yourself because you feel secure, because your parent is there to protect you. But if you take the parent away, you can't do that. You must be now rely on the teacher. Who can now brainwash you? Okay? So are you brainwashing us? Am I brainwashing you? I think it's a drug too. Okay, all right. Okay, so the question is, am I brainwashing you? Okay, that's a good question. And it's a fair question. And again, that's why I tell you this, okay? You have the capacity to ask me questions. You have the capacity to challenge me. You have the capacity to think for yourself, okay? So all I'm saying is, hear me out, ask me questions, and then think for yourself whether or not I make sense. Because the difference between my class and other classes is like, I don't test you, right? I don't give you grades. It's a pass-pale class. You can actually choose to say, you know what? This is nonsense. I don't want to listen anymore. I can't stop you. Okay? But in school, guess what happens if you don't go come to school? Your parents get arrested. All right? Do you understand? That's the difference. It's your choice whether to pay attention or not. All right. So another question is, okay. If schools are designed to brainwash you, what are they brainwashing you in? Well, they designed a brainwasher to believe a concept called the nation state, the nation state. The scores designed to brainwash you to think the nation state exists. It is a person, mother China. You must love this person. You must be willing to sacrifice yourself for this person. You must be willing to dedicate yourself to this person because it is mother China. And how do we brainwash you? We teach you language, right? We teach you history. We teach you geography. We teach you all this to make you believe that the nation state, Mother China, the United States, France, they all exist. But guess what? For most of human history, it was absurd to think the nation state existed. Before you didn't say I'm Chinese. Before you say I'm a Beijinger. Or I'm from Haiden. Or I'm from Chaoyang, right? because that makes more sense. You're from a place where you know the people. But now, because of the nation state, you are forced to believe that you are the same person as someone from Yunnan, Tibet, Guangxi, even though that's the way guys, you have absolutely nothing in common. But you're all Chinese. And that's what school is designed to do. School is designed to implant in you a false memory of a nation state. Okay, that's what history is. History is the false memory of a nation state. And it happened, and that's why you're all forced to go to school. Okay? We also want you to think about degrees and work as a normal person, not to create people business with personal. Yeah, so yeah, so the point of school is to serve the nation state, do you understand? Right? Does that make sense? If you believe in the nation state, if you believe in mother China, then you must serve her, you must obey her, you must fight for her, you must die for her. Okay? So the idea of the nation state was created in order to make you obedient to authority. And it works very effectively. Yeah? I'm just wondering if this works out in all countries, all countries are nation states. Okay? So I mean like I'm not saying China is different from other places. is actually the same as other places. What you will learn in this class is how do we get to this place? Because again, the three things that we learn, money, the individual, the nation state, these are all ideas and concepts beyond the human experience. If you try to work this out from first principles, you try to figure this out by yourself, you couldn't do it. You have to be brainwashed into believing these three things. If someone from the past, maybe a thousand years ago, were to come today and you would explain the concept of money, individual, and nation state. The person would be like, wait a minute here. This means that you're all slaves. Okay. So now the question then is, where do we get these three concepts from? What you will learn in this class is these three concepts come from a revolution in human thought called monotheism. The one true God. This idea of monotheism forever changed the course of human history. And it gave us these concepts of money, individual, and nation state. Monotheism is such a powerful idea that it turned nothing into everything. That's what you will learn in this class. We will learn about monotheism. We will discover how it created money, individual, and the nation state, and basically create the world that we live in today. Okay? All right. Any questions? Should we? Okay, yeah, so there are three great monotheistic religions, right? Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. What I will show you later on is, it's basically the same religion. All right. Okay, so I don't want to give you too much information, okay? Because it's a lot to process. But I want you guys to remember the concepts. Money, individual, and nation state are all powerful concepts that are embedded into everyday life. You cannot escape it. You've been brainwashing and thinking that they all exist when in fact they actually don't exist. And that's how power works. What power is, okay? What power truly is, is what we call alchemy. Alchemy throughout human history was the pursuit of turning lead into gold, okay? Lead into gold, okay? Nothing into everything. That's what alchemy was. And maybe in science class, you're taught that alchemy is this fake science. It's a pseudo science and it did not work. What you will learn in this class is we achieve alchemy. We turn nothing into everything. We turn lead into gold or that's what power is. Power is a capacity to turn nothing into everything. Power is a capacity to make you believe that money is valuable, that the individual can lead to happiness, that the nation state exists. That's what power is. Okay? And as a result, today we live extremely miserable lives. Okay? So you've been taught to think that, oh, life just gets better and better. What you will learn in this class is actually, um, nope. Okay? And what's really important is you will also learn in this class that this was an accident. Okay, this is an accident. It's an accident of the human imagination It's because we didn't know what we're doing that we create this system So you what you also learn is that you're able to control the human imagination You can use it to create a new system That allows for you to ammonia or the flushing of The human intellect, okay. All right any questions? Okay, so that's it for today. Okay, I'll see you guys next class."}

So today we are doing car marks and car marks is one most influential thinkers in human history. His contribution to intellectual thought cannot be overstated. So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to do a thought experiment. Okay? It's just going to be a fun experiment. And let's pretend there are two scenarios. Okay? In scenario one, you get into a really good college and you decide to become a lawyer. You go to law school, you do extremely well, you become a lawyer, and you make a lot of money. And you make a lot of money, you can buy a big house, go on vacations to Bali. You can have a BMW, okay? So that's situation one. You're a super lawyer, basically. Situation two is different. You're on a plane with strangers, and there's 100 of you, you crash on an island. This island, it's very poor, very scarce resources, and you have to work together in order to just get by, okay? You're not eating well, you're not living well, every day is a struggle. You're not really sure if you'll get to the second day. So those are the two scenarios. You're on an island, and you're basically starving. And so the question, the thought experiment is, do you think you'd be a happier person in the first situation or the second situation? Now you? Yeah, so you would think obviously the answer is number one, but what I will show you today is, that's not necessarily true. Maybe for some of us, the answer is number one. But for many of us, the answer is actually number two. Because as humans, we want to feel as though we have a purpose in life and that we are part of a larger mission to change the world for the better. And that's the underlying thesis of Karl Marx. All right, so let's start in Marx. OK, so first understand Marx, we first need to review Kant and Hegel, which we did last class. So Emmanuel Codd. Emmanuel Codd's theory of the world is this. We are all endowed with the capacity to reason. Okay, and it's born in us. We don't learn it, it is just part of who we are. Okay, so, and then this reason interacts with reality. The things in themselves. And then what we see is the appearance. Okay, so the crucial argument that Kant is making is we imagine reality around us by bringing in space and time. Reality, we do not see reality objectively, okay? Or away from us, we see reality as part of us. And with our minds, we create our own universe. And as we discussed last class, this has been confirmed by neuroscience, by artificial intelligence, mechanical mechanics. So it's really a dominant understanding of human psychology we have today. But the problem of immuno-caught, there are three major issues with immuno-caught. The first major issue is if we can never know reality, then how do we know what's real and what's fake? How do we know we don't live in a computer simulation? And the answer is we don't know. So it's the first issue of immuno-caught. He does not give us proof of an objective reality. That's the first problem. Second problem is the source for our reason. If we are born with the capacity to imagine space and time and shape our reality, who gives it to us? Where does it come from? And he doesn't really answer that question. Now third question is a problem of uniformity. What you should say, how do I know that you and me and others see the world in the same way? Why aren't we seeing a different reality? And then Emmanuel Cahn says, well, we don't know either. So these are the three major problems created by Emmanuel Cahn's philosophy of the world. So Frederick Hegel comes along and resolves all three issues. And what he says is this. He says that the underlying source of reality is called the geist. The geist is the spirit of the world. Think of it as a God that's becoming into reality. It's growing. It's almost like the internet, collective consciousness. And as a result, the guys is giving us the capacity to reason and to see itself and then to imagine our own reality. So the idea that guys solves all three problems at once. An underlying reality that creates the material reality. So Hegel is an idealist, meaning for him, what matters is ideas and spirit. and the material what is created from these ideas and from spirit, okay? So these are the, so what, this is Hegel. What Karl Marx will do is build on Hegel to create something called dialectical materialism, which is the idea of class struggle, okay? And he will create his philosophy based on his reading of Hegel. All right, so let's go over how Marx interprets Hegel. So again, Hegel has three major ideas. The first is the idea of the Geist, OK? The underlying superstructure of reality. Second is the idea of the dialectic. OK, so the idea of the dialectic is, how does this Geist become what it does, what it is? How does this Geist learn and think? And the answer is the dialectic. That dialectic is thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. And the concept is just a debate in itself. For it to know itself, it must create its opposite. And then when it creates its opposite, it debates itself and creates a synthesis. Okay, and it's the idea of a debate where you might have viewpoint and you engage with someone with another viewpoint that's opposite of yours, you debate and through this debate, you create a synthesis of your different viewpoints. And for Hegel, this is the underlying logic of history, of how we learn, of how we progress. And the third idea that Hegel proposes is either of the master-slave dialectic. And so Hegel thinks that relationship can be broken into a master and slave. Basically, I command you, you do, as I say, you obey me. But then what Hegel says is, over time, this thesis, interfaces, also becomes a synthesis. Why? Because as your master, I become dependent on you as my slave. In fact, you're the one doing all the work. So about you, I can't exist. So in this way, the relationship inverts itself. And the master becomes slave to the slave, because the master is now dependent on the slave for his livelihood. So these are the three big ideas that Hegel is gonna take. Sorry, these are the three big ideas of Hegel, and Marx is gonna take these three ideas and develop his own theory of the world. So Marx, Marx is from Prussia. As we discussed before, a lot of these major philosophers are from Prussia. Hegel himself was also Prussia. He was very proud to be Prussia. And Marx, when he was in university, was part of a group called the Young Hegelians. These are individuals, a group of them who worship Hegel, but they misinterpreted Hegel. They thought of Hegel as an atheist because he said, God is dead. But when Hegel said God is dead, what he really meant is, I am now going to reinterpret God not as this separate entity from us but as part of us in the form of the guys. So the Young Hungarian will reinterpret Hegel and basically misinterpret him. So the first thing they do is they take the guys and they turn into a material thing, economics. So Hegel thinks it's ideas that come first than material reality. But these guys, the Young Hungarian, they will invert this and say it's material reality that creates ideas. It's economic, it's wealth that creates culture which gives rise to ideas. So it's the complete opposite. Second thing they'll do is if this is true, the dialectic and the master-slave relationship, then history is a history of oppression and a struggle for liberation against this oppression. And so the idea of the material world in struggle towards self creates the idea of dialectical materialism. And we call this class struggle, okay? The rich and the poor funny each other and the poor are looking for liberation, right? So does that make sense? Okay, great. So that's right, so this is class struggle. And this is the main contribution that Marx will make. And by creating this idea, he will lay the foundation for what we refer to as communism. The underlying reality of history is class struggle. The other thing that Marx will take from Hegel is an understanding that all of history is theological. Theological. This is a big word, but all it means is there is an ability to history. There's a purpose. There's a progress to history. Everything is being done for a reason. So let's go over the theology that Marx creates. So we were born as hunter-gatherers. We all know this. We're out in the forest hunting food in small tribes. And we're happy. But there's not enough food to feed everyone. So we develop agriculture. And then because of agriculture, we have something called surplus value. We're able to create more wealth, which allows a few of us to settle down and do other stuff. For example, create literacy. And this gives rise to civilization. And then to justify this civilization, to justify this hierarchy, the fact that you have a few people who are essentially parasites of society, we create the idea of religion. Because the elite now are priests. So that's the second stage. Then what happens is as we develop more technology and the societies become larger and larger, we have to go to war against each other, okay, to fight for resources. And so this gives rise to the master-slave relationship, which then gives us feudalism, okay, which then allows for the rise of industrial capitalism. And this is a stage Marx finds himself at. And what Mark says is this is all a linear progress given by technological advancement, right? So agriculture is an advancement. And then you have tools, and you have weapons. Then you have castles, knights. And now you have steamships. So it's all part of a technological plan to liberate humanity, technology. Now, and he's running here in 1848, OK? And now, industrial capitalism will naturally lead to communism. He says this is not something that we can hope for or work towards. It's something that's going to happen because of history. History is God. God is history. Our world's been developed through the mind of God. So first thing he does is he uses the Hegelian dialectic. So feudalism is the thesis, industrial capitalism is the emphasis, and then together they will create communism. Why? So for Marx, embedded in capitalism is the seeds of its demise. And there are three reasons why. First is, industrial capitalism is imperial. It's all consumer. It expands. And as a result, it's going to create a global polyteriot. And because they're all oppressed, they're going to come into clotchiness together and recognize that only for collective action can we live with ourselves from the capitalist class. And because the polyteriot is the majority of people, 99%, then no one person have no chance. That's number one. Number two is the idea of technology. Capitalism gives rise to new technology which creates surplus value and surplus labor. It basically makes our job easier. Which case, we don't have to work as hard as before in order to create value. So that's technology. So for example, AI, right? And the third is the idea of crisis in capitalism. Crisis in capitalism. And what this means is for Marx, capitalism is fundamentally unsustainable. It will collapse at a certain point. Why? Well, there are many reasons why. So for Marx, the main problem is overproduction. You're producing all these goods, but because you're impoverishing everyone, no one's going to buy these goods. In which case the economy's going to collapse, right? That's one possibility. Another possibility is presented by a man named Thomas Piketty. And he wrote a famous book called Capital in the 21st Century. And he's working off Marx. And what he believes the fundamental paradox of capitalism is a problem of financialization. So all this is saying is this. At first, we have to build a factory to generate wealth. But once we have generated enough wealth, we want to take this wealth and go invest it somewhere. Because it's easier for us, and we can make more money that way. But over time, as capitalism grows and grows, everyone wants to invest, no one wants to manufacture. And what happens then is the financial economy is going faster than the manufacturing economy. In fact, for Piketty, the financial economy will go at 5%, whereas the manufacturing economy will go at 2%. This means that if you put your money in a stock market, you'll make 5% a year. If you open a restaurant, or you create a factory, or you do something useful, you make 2% a year. So no one wants to work anymore, right? So for a pickety, capitalism will have to end at some point. Then you have a name named Carol Quigley. And he's a historian. We discussed him last week. But he's a historian at Georgetown. He's dead. But he wrote a famous book called Tragedy and Hope. And he argues that capitalism goes in faces. The first phase is consumer capitalism where companies are trying to create products that consumers want to buy. then that leads to financial capitalism where now companies just want investor wealth. But over time, the final stage is the idea of monopoly capitalism, where a few companies control all the resources. And in which case, we pay a lot of money for crappy stuff. And then we don't want to buy anything anymore. So for Marx and for Piketty and for Kierle quickly, capitalism can only lead to crisis. And then because of the crisis, the Polterit will organize and then rebel and then create a workers' paradise, which leads to communism. That's the logic of Marx. That is Marx's understanding of history. All right, so what I'm going to explain now is why would this be popular? Why would this history be popular for people? Because communism was one of the most popular movements throughout the 20th century. And the problem that marks diagnosis is capitalism makes people miserable for three reasons. So the issues of capitalism. The first issue is that it is all-encompassing, all-consuming. So in other words, it just grows and grows. And because it has to grow and grow to create value, it starts worse. So you have imperialism, right? Because as a factory owner, you want to create new markets. You want access to cheaper goods. You want access to cheaper labor. Therefore, you force your government to go invade other countries like China, India, Africa. So capitalism creates wars and human misery all around the world. It's all consuming. It's always expanding. Second problem with capitalism is that it consolidates. Consolidating. And the idea here is this. Capitalism can only lead to extreme inequality. Why? Because the point of capitalism is to generate as much wealth as possible. So to do that, we want to consolidate our wealth. So maybe there's 10 of us with a million dollars each, right? Well, we're better off just putting our money together and then investing it together, right? Which creates massive inequality. So over time, Marx believes that because capitalism is all-consuming and consolidating, it will destroy the middle class. Unless you're super wealthy, you won't have any money. If you are just like a small factory owner, you'll be bought up by a large factory owner. And quite honestly, this is what's happening in the world today. If you are a small house owner in America, well, you're going to be bought out by a company. And then the company is going to use your house to rent to other people. So this is a pattern that's happening throughout the world today. And that's why Marx is seeing a massive resurgence in our world today. Now, the third problem is alienating. And here, Marx explains that there are four types of alienation. The first type of alienation is the alienation of labor. What this means is this. As humans, we want to create stuff. We are fundamentally creative. We want to create art products. We want to cook. We want to teach. We want to express our individuality. And what I want to do that is we will express our individuality. When we create things, we support the community. So when I teach, you guys learn. And when you learn, you feel good, you thank me, and that confirms my humanity, that confirms my individuality. So society is a mechanism for each of us to exchange our creativity in a way that affirms our own individuality. Does that make sense? The problem with capitalism is it takes use value. What this thing is used for, it and replace it for like exchange value, which is how much this thing is worth. And these are two different opposites. Oh, sorry, these are two different concepts. So use value is I cook a apple pie, and I give it to you, and you eat it, and you say, well, this is a really awesome apple pie. Thank you so much. And then you feel good, I feel good. That's use value. Exchange value is I cook this apple pie, and I give it to someone who then goes sells to someone. I never meet that person, okay? And I'm not, and I don't know what happens to the pie. But I'm paid like $5 for it, all right? So that's the idea of exchange value. And as such, what Marx says is, this exchange of goods does not affirm our individuality, therefore it makes us miserable. Because we don't know why we're doing anything anymore. Okay, before we're doing things in order to support a community in order to please other people, in order to affirm our humanity. Now we're just making stuff because of wage labor, right? Wages to get paid. So that's alienating for us. This makes sense, right? Wait. Second is that it alienates us from ourselves. Why? Because as human beings, we are very complex. We are multifaceted. And we're always evolving. But for capitalism, what matters is division of labor, specialization, because that's what allows for the most rapid industrial growth. And so in other words, you cease to be you and you become a hand, or maybe a finger or maybe an eye or maybe an ear. Okay. But you cease to be complete. You just be, you're just like a cock in the machine. You're just a piece of the puzzle and that alienates you from who you are really. It'll, it, it prevents you from achieving your full potential as a creative, vibrant human being. Okay. That's the second issue. The third issue is it alienates us from nature. Okay. Why? because capitalism grows by exploiting humans and by exploiting nature. It cuts down trees. It destroys the environment. It creates air pollution. We can no longer drink clean water. It destroys nature. And it makes us feel that we must destroy nature if we are to feed our families. So it alienates us from our nature, whereas historically we have been in a symbolic relationship with nature where we thank nature for feeding us. But we're always replenishing, we're always protecting nature. Now, fourth type of alienation is alienation from humanity. So before, from almost of history, we were cooperating with each other. We were helping each other out. Because that's the only way you could survive. But capitalism forces us to compete against each other. And the example, of course, is school, where because of grades, you see your classmates as competitors. Right? But if there are no grades, then you might help each other learn. You might tutor each other in homework and help each other with homework and tests. OK? So that doesn't make sense. So the idea here is let's just say that maybe five people are have to carry some goods to a store. OK? That's your job. One person falls down, breaks his leg, and cries out for help. Well, we should go help that person, right? But the logic of capitalism is you can't do that because the manager will find you for being late. Does that make sense? So that's why Marx thinks that this will alien us from our humanity. And this part of Marx, where Marx diagnoses the plums of capitalism, is considered blind. This is a perfect encapsulation of all the issues with capitalism that was true in the 1850s, in the 19th century, but it's also true today. If you look at the world today, then we also have these issues. And if you analyze Marx's diagnosis of capitalism, then it helps explain why the world is the way it is. All right. So, and because of these pressing issues, because people are starting so much, They see Marxism, they see communism as salvation and redemption. That's the appeal, okay? Because the capitalism has made life so miserable for a majority of people, okay? All right, so, but the problem is we know that this prophecy of Marx that we will naturally evolve into communism has not pan out. In fact, communism has caused a lot of human misery as well. And so why is that the case? And so what I'm gonna show you now is even though Marx has this beautiful theory, it's also wrong for a variety of reasons. So let's analyze his understanding of history and show how it's wrong. The first thing is, let's go to the hunter-gatherer agricultural transition. The first class I ever taught a long, long time ago is the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture didn't make any sense. As a hunter-gatherer, you didn't have a scarcity problem. In fact, you ate really well. You worked less. You ate more. And we know because if you dig up skeletons of hunter-gatherers, they're taller than farmers. In fact, they're a lot taller. So hunter-gatherers were on average like 6'6\", which is really, really tall. And farmers were on average maybe 5' That's a huge difference. So using the economic argument of Marx, this makes no sense. And what I explained to you before is, it's not economics that drives human history. It's religion that drives human history. So we settled down in order to practice a cult, to practice a religion. Because maybe one place was considered divine for whatever reason. And as a result, we developed our culture, which led to civilization. So the Marx formulation that religion comes last is wrong. It's religion that comes first, okay? It's religion that leads to agriculture, which leads to civilization, right? So that's what Marx gets wrong. Also, the transition from feudalism to capitalism was not driven by technology, it was driven by religion. All right, so let me explain. Okay, so the feudalism, the dominant religion at this time was the Catholic religion. When we go into industrial capitalism, The dominant religion is Protestantism. Okay? So as we discussed before, the Catholic religion was an imperial bureaucracy led by the Pope. And there were many religious reformers who thought this was abhorrent. This went against the will of God. Okay? And so what they proposed was this. They proposed a religion which was democratic in which everyone had access to God. Okay? Before you had to listen to the priest. You couldn't read the Bible by yourself. Now you had to read the Bible yourself in order to access God by yourself. Okay? And there were two major different, there are two major transitions. The first is, before, in order to get to heaven, you have to use justification by works. All this means is, you do good things. You give money to the church, you probably give money to the church, okay? All right? But because the Protestants want to reduce the power of the Catholic Church, they said, no, what matters is certification by faith. It doesn't matter how much money you give to the church. What matters is, do you truly believe in God? That's what matters. So that's the first major difference. And then the process, in order to reduce the power of the church, because the church said, only if you listen to us can we guarantee you access to heaven, right? So what the process said is, no. Access to heaven is predestined. So they have predestination. In other words, at the beginning of time, God has already decided who will go to heaven and who will go to hell. He's already decided, so it doesn't matter what the church tells you, it doesn't matter how much money you give to the church, you're all gonna hell if you don't believe truly believe in God. So the Protestant religion was a direct response to the Catholic religion. Now this creates a new problem. The problem is this. How do you know you truly believe in God? How do you know that you are one of the elect? How do you know that you were chosen by God to go to heaven? This creates anxiety, right? Anxiety, as we know, leads to OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, right? So how do you compensate for OCD? Well, you make a lot of money. But not only do you make a lot of money, but you don't spend it. Because that wealth now is an indicator to you and to others that you are truly one of the elect, that you are saved by God, that you are chosen by God to go to heaven. And that's the birth of capitalism. Okay? Does that make sense? All right? It was not technology driven because the technology at that time was everywhere. But it was only in Europe that you have industrial capitalism. It was because of the pros and the faith. That's what drove it. Okay. So you're turning this wealth not to appease God, but to appease your anxiety. You understand? You won't give money to God because God doesn't need your money, okay? But having this money is confirmation to yourself that you will go to heaven because this money can only be made because of your faith in God. Do you understand? Okay? How do you know you believe in God? Because you worked hard and God made you wealthy. And that's the logic driving capitalism. So Marx missed this. Okay? So let's summarize and say, look, Marx made three fundamental mistakes. The first is people care about religion, not economics, okay? Which religion that drives him in this street, not economics, that's the first mistake he made. Second mistake that he made is people care about God, not heaven, okay? In other words, we're going to heaven, not because we think it's a five-star hotel, we have like lots and lots of like, I know like lobsters and steaks and oil geed buffets. That's not the reason we're going to heaven. We're going to heaven to be with God because God represents eternal truth, eternal salvation. We want to be with God. The third is people care about status, not class. So in other words, throughout most of human history, we didn't have a cost of money. So for example, the Vikings, when they went off to steal, they stole lots of gold, right? But when they got back to the village, they would hold a big feast for everyone. And they would waste all this money. You understand? Because there's absolutely no point in having money. You couldn't spend it. If you died, you couldn't keep it. So you made money, you got it in order to raise your status within the community. Okay, and that's why you wore gold. Because the gold signified that you have high status within the community. So for most of human history and still even today, we seek status, not class. The class of a class is credit because of industrial capitalism, because of the free market, okay? Because now people were mobile, okay? But before it was about status, okay? And so what this means is this, because Marx interpreted history incorrectly and he didn't understand human psychology, what he could not predict is When we did achieve communism, it would become bureaucratic hierarchies with core personalities. In the Soviet Union, you had Stalin, right? It was in charge of a bureaucracy. And in China, you had Mao Zedong, who was in charge of a bureaucracy. North Korea's the same situation. Why? Because of these three factors, right? Mao, Stalin, all understood that people want a religion. They want to feel close to God. So they made themselves God. And people want status and that's why it's more to have a bureaucracy. So that's why communism became the way it became in the 20th century. So does this make sense? All right, great. So even though the Marx philosophy is very appealing, it's very clear, it's very direct, it's very sexy, he got the history wrong. And because he got the history wrong, The consequences were huge, okay? Because communism created a lot of wars and it led to a lot of disasters like famines and stuff. Any questions before I move on? Okay, yeah, so that's a really good question. And so the question is, the role of religion should be obvious to people, right? Why do they believe in economics? Okay. Okay, that's a great question and you know what, I don't have an answer, but I think the clue is this. Capitalism and communism are the same religion. So as capitalism grows, it reinforces communism. As communism grows, it reinforces capitalism. Why? Because both believe that economics, materialism is the underlying reality. Religion doesn't matter. So capitalism spreads by making everyone uniform, by turning everyone into an economic animal. Because today we don't ask you to believe in God, we ask you to go buy things. Doesn't make sense. Colonism is the same way. Colonism believes that as long as there's equality, as long there's no property, everyone will be happy. So it's ironic that these two ideas, capitalism and communism, even though they were mortal enemies of the point of century, the underlying basis of the religion is the same. And as they develop, they reinforce each other. Okay? That doesn't make sense. All right? So, but that's a great question. All right? So we instantly understand that religion is more important than economics. But because capitalism and communism were able to spread so fast, we've been brainwashed in your thinking that only economics matters. Okay? So for example, when you read the newspaper, it's always, what's a GDP this year? What's the employment rate this year? What's the inflation rate this year? What's the price of eggs this year? It's never, how do people feel spiritually? How are people religiously? It's never about your psychology. It's never about your spirituality. It's always about, how much money do you have? So communism and capitalism together conquer the world. Does that make sense? Okay, great. Any more questions before I move on? Okay, this is a great question. So Marx himself believed the revolution will happen in Germany first, because Germany had the most advanced Poletariat. But it never happened in Germany. It didn't happen in France, it didn't happen in Britain. It happened in China and Russia. And in fact, if Marx were alive today, he would be appalled by the fact that happened in Russia and China. because it wasn't supposed to happen in Russia and China. You needed a Poletariat in order for the revolution to happen, but Russia and China were peasant nations, right? So what had happened in Russia and China? Okay, the main reason is this, and we'll go more into this next week, okay? The main reason is this, because the Communist Revolution was not a Communist revolution, it was a peasant revolution with the veneer of communism. So communism was the ideology, the religion that they practiced, but it was essentially a present rebellion that's no different from previous present rebellions in Chinese history. Does that make sense? But I'll explain this later on. Great question. And any more questions before I move on? Great. So was this clear to you, this history? All right, good. And it's very important because it really helps you understand the world we live in today. Because even though Marx's theory of history is wrong, his understanding of capitalism is perfect, okay? And it really helps you think about why things are happening the way they are today, especially the constellation of wealth. All right, let's do the history, okay? All right, so, okay. We did Kant and Hegel on Tuesday. We're doing Marx today. Next to it, we do Freud. Why are we doing these four thinkers? Because they're the ones, each of them, who created an intellectual revolution. That fundamentally changed the way we see ourselves and society. So remember, Kant made us subjective. He taught us that the world does not exist outside us. Hegel taught us that there's a guise that compels us. We are just a manifestation of this guise. but the guys is everything. Marx teaches us it's class struggle that's the underlying force of history. Okay, and what he also believes is the class struggle can only end in communism. Why? Because that is the will of God. Because God manifests itself in our history. All right, so Marx is really building on top of Hegel. What we will learn next Tuesday is Freud. Okay, so, and Freud's gonna work on all three to build a new theory of the world. And the theory is amazing because what he does is, he takes all these theories and teaches us that we are our own universe. Everything that happens is because of our memories and our psychology, okay? But that's next Tuesday. But just to give you a heads up. All right, so the entire lecture is about why was Marx wrong? Okay, and as explained, the run is of Marx, I mean he was like a prophet, right? He comes from a Jewish family. He himself was an atheist, but he came from a long line of Jewish rabbis. And when I say that, you're like, okay, that doesn't sound that impressive. But it was basically the equivalent of saying he came from 10 generations of Harvard professors. That's really impressive, right? So I mean, he was a genius. His entire family were geniuses. Remember, the Jews are very intellectual people. They were the people of the book. And the rabbis are the most intellectual members of the community. They're the leaders of the community. So Marx comes from, he's basically an aristocrat. So he's almost like a prophet. I mean, he is a prophet. He's a poet prophet who's preaching of a new world to come. And he's very certain, he's very clear, and he's very optimistic. And that's his appeal. But I should explain, that was also his downfall. who's too simple in his understanding of human history. All right, so industrial capitalism is coming to Europe and it makes everyone miserable. It's destroying society because it's taking all these people from the villages and transporting them into the cities without adequate housing, without adequate healthcare. Work safety. They're in these slums, they don't have access to clean water, a lot of them are dying. their children are being forced to work from age five or six. It's all polluted. So people are living in absolute misery, especially children. And this is causing a lot of anger. What really does it is in the 1840s there's a massive potato famine all across Europe. So remember in the 16th century the Europeans and Spanish discovered the new world and they brought back the potato. Why is that important? Because a potato will allow Europe to grow its population very, very fast in order to feed its economic needs. The problem, though, is when you rely on a single crop, the potato, it's prone to disease. So the potato, because of its lack of biodiversity, it created a famine throughout Europe. Tens of millions of people died in the famine. And so a lot of them immigrated over to the New World, America and South America. The worst hit part of Europe, of course, was Ireland. So as you can see, only Dublin managed to maintain or increase its population. Everywhere else saw a massive decrease in its population. The red represents a population decrease of 30% or more in the span of a few years, from 1841 to 1851, 10 years. Okay, so this was a massive traumatic event in Europe. And this led to, sorry, this led to massive uprisings throughout Europe. Okay, and this is what inspired marks and angles to write the Communist Manifesto. Because they believed a new order was coming, and we have to prepare for it. Okay, now, what happened is, the 1848 revolutions are calling for three things. They're calling for nationalism. nation states based on France, they're calling for liberalism, more political rights, and socialism, more worker rights. And it's all happening throughout Europe. And so Marx and Engels is convinced paradise is coming. But ultimately the authorities crack down, but Marx and Engels are still convinced paradise is coming at any point. So they dedicate their entire lives to imagining this new world. The Congress Manifesto was published in 1848 in the anticipation of this Pulitzer victory over the capitalist class. Okay? And it is an amazing document. It's beautifully written. I don't think they get enough credit for how wonderful this is written. Okay? But let's read the beginning. Right? Aspector is haunting Europe. Aspector of communism. So the specter is important because remember it's the geist. Hegel said that the underlying force of the world is the guys. And what they're saying is that guys is communism. Common is the future. It is what will happen. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy lines to exercise the specter Pope and Tsar. So all the authorities of the world are afraid of this guys. But this guys is God. So it will triumph eventually. Okay? Let's read the end. To this end, communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish, and Danish languages. This is really important because this is one of the first international revolutions. It's gonna sweep all around the world. Okay, it will replace capitalism. Capitalism is only the building block for communism. Okay. The communist manifesto is powerful. It's wonderfully written, it's poetry. And I think that over the next few years, as the economic crisis worsens around the world, people are going to refer back to the communist manifesto. But this is really the best part of communist manifesto, where Marx and Engels diagnose the problems of capitalism. The bourgeoisie, the capitalist class, Wherever it has got the upper hand has been an end to all feudal patriarchal I date relations it has pitously torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound men to his natural superiors And has left remaining no other nexus between men and men then make itself interest then call itself cash payment Okay, so remember capitalism it isn't all Expanding all all-consuming alienating force and it's destroying the world. But for most of the angles, this is good because it will lead to the rise of communism, right? This is part of the thesis, antipasist, and this is part of history. So the Borscht regime are engaged in imperialism. It's destroying all that we've known before to create a new man, an economic man, only based on self-interest. It's even destroying the family. Okay? So you no longer see yourself as a son or father or as a husband, you see yourself as a man who makes $10,000 a year or $50,000 a year and is able to buy, I don't know, a car or whatever. Okay? So that's the power of capitalism. But again, for Marxist angle, this is good because now it will lead to communism, where this new consciousness will transform into a class solidarity. Okay? This makes sense, right? Okay, so Marx's most famous work is Das Kapital, and he spent decades writing this. The problem with Marx is that he's a brilliant man. He's one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, but he's extremely disciplined. He procrastinates all the time. So he actually never finished this book in his life. it's Frederick Engels, who was his best friend, his collaborator, but Frederick Engels was a very disciplined individual. So it's Frederick Engels who put this book together. All right. So as I mentioned, what's really important for us to understand is that Marx, he's a prophet. He doesn't think of himself as a prophet. He doesn't know he's a prophet, but he's really a prophet. And as such, what he's really doing is he's just building on top of Christianity. He's just extending the logic of Christianity. So let's see what he does. Christianity is a passive religion. You don't even have to do anything. Just don't commit any sins, and then you're going to heaven. But for Marx, what's important is that we participate in a revolution, that we are responsible for our lives. Second difference is, Christianity argues that only a few can go to heaven. They argue about who will go to heaven, but only a few, okay? Only a minority of the people, okay? That's why you have hell, purgatory, and heaven, three different places. But for Marx, he believes that working spheroids can be a cheat for everyone, okay? And the third difference is, Christianity offers, heaven of God, Marx offers, you talk about God. The problem is this, no one wants you to talk about God, okay? We discuss this where if heaven was just a five star hotel, where you could eat all the best food in the world, no one will want to go. People are going to heaven for God. And this is why Marx cannot anticipate the rise of people like Stalin and Mao Zedong. OK, this is a letter that Marx wrote in his early years. And it is probably, in my opinion, his best piece of writing, because it really shows you his thinking, his optimism, his idealism. So let's read it together. Supposing that we have produced, in a human manner, In this production, each of us would have doubly affirmed himself and his fellow man. I would objectify in my production, my individuality, and his peculiarity, and would thus have enjoyed in my activity an individual expression of my life and would have also had, and look at the object, the individual pleasure of realizing that my personality was objective. Okay? Does that make sense? So you're creating something, and this thing is the perfect expression of your individuality, of your personality, of your creativity. And then you show other people and they enjoy it and that and because they enjoy it that process Affirms your individuality and your creativity your validation basically, okay? All right, I Would have been for you the mediator between you and the species and does have been felt by you and acknowledged as a Completion of your own essence and a necessary part of yourself and I would then thereby have realized that I was confirmed Both in your thought and in your love, okay, so when I cook a meal and you enjoy the meal You're not only affirming my individuality, but you're affirming my connection to all humanity, okay, because you're telling me that I contribute positively to the species, right? The problem is this. Presupposing private property, my individuality is so far externalized that I hate my activity. It is a torment to me and only the appearance of an activity and thus also merely a force activity that is laid upon me through an external arbitrary need, not an inner, unnecessary one. So this is complicated, but all he's saying is this, I cook you a meal, I spent days preparing this meal. I put, it's a labor of love. I cook the best food in the world. I give it to you. You are blown away. You are in love with this food. And And then you're like, here's $1,000. That's disgusting. All you have to do is say, thank you, but instead you give me $1,000. And you think, well, I'm giving you $1,000. That's a lot of money, man. I don't pay this much at a restaurant. So that's what Marx is saying. The moment you put money into the equation, it destroys all human relations. So he's talking about intrinsic motivation whereas versus intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is what makes us fundamentally human. Extrusion motivation is what makes us slaves. Okay? So that's what Marx is saying. Capitalism makes us slaves because it deprives us of our humanity. Okay? That's what money does. So does this make sense to you? Great. All right. So again, let's just summarize what the feelings of capitalism are. Okay? It creates inequality, it exploits, and it alienates. All right? So for Marx and Engels, the emphasis will be class solidarity, and this will lead to a classless work as paradise. That's very logic of Marxism. So again, Marx, what he will do is he will invert Hegel. So for Hegel, it's the ideas that come first. Then this will lead to the material reality. For Marx, it's the material reality that gives rise to ideas. So the idea is to show the superstructure, the base is the economics. So this is a very important idea of Marx. So Marx diagnoses the problems of capitalism really, really well, okay? And he offers solutions. And what's really important is, one reason why communism has failed is capitalism has actually adopted a lot of these policy changes, okay? Including universal child education, including the universal right to work, including abolition of child factory labor. So in many ways, common sense has won out. And Marx didn't really predict this because he thought that capitalists are idiots. Capitalists all they care about is money. So there's like servants to capital. They're not really in control. And if you're a capitalist and you have any empathy for the working class, guess what? You're bought out or you're pushed out of the capitalist class. So it's only the worst people who can thrive within the capitalist system. But because communism was a huge threat to the ruling elite, they had no choice to make compromises. And that's why after World War II, most countries in the world became socialists, even though in name they were still capitalist. Okay, so let's summarize, and this is really important for us. But what are the four things Marx got wrong? The first thing is Marx believed that history is a linear progress. It's a straight line of inability, of progress. But that's not true, okay? History repeats itself. That's the first issue. Second issue is Marx believed in the inability of history. But there's always randomness built into history. Things happen and we don't expect these things to happen. Third is Marx believed class struggle or whatever, everything. But people care actually a lot more about religion than they care about economics. All right? And this is a huge issue in America because with the rest of Donald Trump, then the Democratic Party, they don't know what to do about this because they're like, you know, Trump says that he will lower the price of eggs, but he hasn't lowered the price of eggs. So like, stop warning for him. And what the Democrats don't understand is people want to believe in God. People want a leader. People want a religion. And Trump, for all his feelings, he understands that and gives people what they really want, which is emotional solidarity, a belief in a better world. Last thing, Marx's belief of Vanguard needed to lead the Poletariat into a paradise. Okay, so Marx really believed that you needed an elite of intellectuals, scientists, technocrats, to create the perfect society. But then the question then is, Why would they give up power? Once they have this power, why do they give it up? And the answer is they wouldn't give it up. And that's why communism ultimately fails in the Soviet Union and in China. This makes sense, right? So let's go into specifics. In this class, what you learn is it's not a class struggle by itself that causes discontent. It's three other things. The first is elite overproduction. So a really important principle is history is not fought over between the poor and the rich. It's fought over between the very rich and the natural rich. The upper nobility and the lower nobility. Because Marx came from Jewish aristocracy. Engels, his father was a very wealthy capitalist. These are people who were a lot and they wanted more. Does that make sense? So when you have too many people seeking too much wealth status, it creates conflict. That's the first thing. Second thing is that they have ratutopia, where people live too long. They live too long. They refuse to give up power. They refuse to innovate. They refuse to see status to the young. The third is the idea of financialization. As we discussed, Thomas Piketty and Carol Cookley provide this idea where over time, to make more money, all couples will do is force everyone into more debt. And these are the three factors that cost society to ultimately destabilize. Clear? Great. All right. So let's look at three examples. You look at Soviet Union. You look at China. You look at France. How was it possible for the Soviet Union to defeat Germany? And Germany was at that time the most advanced military in the world. How did the Chinese economy boom after the Cultural Revolution? And how did the Polish friends defeat all of Europe? So what we need to understand is these were not communist revolutions. These were just revolutions that destroyed the old elite. And all this is saying is this, people are playing a game in society. Over time, you have a few winners who monopolize this game, and this causes discontent. What revolutions do is they reset the game, and that creates a lot of energy, because people now want to work hard to win the game. And because of this energy, they're able to defeat their opponents. Same thing with the cultural revolution where the cultural revolution removed the old elite, the bureaucrats. So in the 1980s when trying to open up, you have these young people with entrepreneurial drive. These are companies. But without the cultural revolution, this entrepreneurial drive could not have succeeded. Does that make sense? All right. All right. This is really complicated, okay? But for Marx, what gives rise to industrial capitalism and the bourgeoisie is just technology. and the progress of history. But as we learn this class, it's actually much more complicated than that, okay? So this is really important, okay? What we're gonna do is we're gonna review what we learned previously and put them together to explain what gave rise to industrial capitalism. First thing is the monotheistic revolution, okay? So remember, before societies were paganistic or polyphistic, and then with Constantine, God became the Holy Trinity, okay? The Holy Trinity is the weirdest idea in human history. The holy trinity is this. God is nothing and everything. And what this means is God is both real and not real. God is a symbol and reality itself. And because of this idea, people are now forced to think abstractly about the world. And this gives rise to money, nation-state and science. People are now forced to think abstractly about the world. Whereas people were before could think very concretely about the world. Does that make sense? All right, second thing is gun power revolution where nation states, countries were forced to compete against each other, which led to more industry, more population growth, and more centralization. And this paves the way for the Borscht Rosino, okay? Because now you need the Borscht Rosino to produce industry, okay? And the third is the process of reformation, we discussed this, right? Where you now have anxiety created by this new religion. And they needed to force themselves to believe they are the elect. And then the age of exploration, where the old world, Europe could go and create new markets and still go and bring the potato, corn and tomato back into Europe, which allows for population growth. So in other words, history is a very complicated process. A lot of randomness is built in. And this is something that Marx didn't really understand. All right. So to summarize, what people want is status, not class. People want to feel distinguished, feel superior, feel that they've achieved a great deal. The money doesn't really matter. The money is just a symbol of this. People want religion, not economics. People want God, not heaven. And the proof, again, is what happens when communism wins. So both the Soviet Union and China became theocracies with a lot of personalities. They were not common societies, they were theocracies. They were religious. They were no different in many ways than Catholic Europe during the Middle Ages. Soviet Union fell apart because a party no longer believed in the system and chose to monetize their status and power. And then the third example is North Korea has a fertility rate of 1.79, while South Korea has a fertility rate of 0.78. So North Korea is a theocratic society, South Korea is a capitalistic society. Oh, cult of personality is you believe this person is the manifestation of God. All your hope, all your emotions are invested in this one person. Right, so Stalin, right? His pictures were everywhere. And in school you learn about how great he was. You worshiped him, he was God to you. But something with China during the Mao Zedong era, okay, does that make sense? So we call this a cult of personality. like a new religion based on one person. Alright, so North Korea, which is poorer than South Korea, has more children, right? Why? Well, because people in North Korea, sorry, in South Korea are miserable. They have money, but they don't have religion. They don't have a purpose. They don't have any meaning. It's all competition, okay? So this is like capitalism run amok. Then you go to North Korea and he's president, okay? He's dead, but he's still present. Why? Because he's divine. He's God. He is the forever present. Kim Il-Soon. OK? And I mean, I have to say this, but if you go to North Korea, they're probably happier than they are in South Korea. And the other thing about North Korea is they're not fighting Ukraine. So these are people who are willing to die for what they believe in. So I would say if I had to bet which nation had the best future, I would bet North Korea over South Korea. OK, let's talk about the vanguard idea. So for Marx, a really important idea is you need an intellectual lead to lead the Poleterians into paradise. And this is a man named Macau Buchanan. And he was an anarchist. He was not a communist, he was an anarchist. The difference is this, they both believed in the same thing, Marx and Buchanan, but Marx said you need a vanguard. Whereas Buchanan said, no, a vanguard would destroy everything. It has to be spontaneous. It has to be from the people. OK? Buchanan is also low on ability. His father was a Russian aristocrat. And Marx and Buchanan, they were colleagues, but they hated each other. All right? All right, so we can't believe a lot of things that Marx believes, right? The freedom of every other individual does not limit my own as the individualist claim on the contrary, it is confirmation, realization and human dignity of all persons to see and feel my freedom confirm sanction and boundlessly expanded by universal agreement is happiness, it is human paradise on earth. So for freedom to be fully achieved, everyone must be free, everyone must be equal. Otherwise, no one can be truly free. All right, so Buchanan will explain why a bureaucratic elite will destroy communism, all right? So this is a very important passage from Buchanan. Available to everyone will be a general scientific education, especially the learning of a scientific method, the habit of correct thinking, the ability to generalize from facts and make more or less correct deductions. But of encyclopic minds and advanced sociologists, there will be very few. To be sad for mankind if at any time, theoretical speculation became the only source of guidance for society. If science alone were in charge of all social administration, life wither and human society would turn into a voiceless and servile herd. The domination of life by science can have no other result than the brutalization of mankind. Okay, this is an important passage. All the saying is this, before we were intellectuals, we were curious about the world. Now we are technocrats, we're engineers. We're taught a very specific skill And we're taught to see the world in a very specific way. And we're run by technocrats. And this has led to the globalization of mankind, because it has led to the alienation of mankind. We are now just parts of a machine. So an example, of course, is AI. So these people in charge now want to make AI the dominant religion of the world. They want to make human slave to AI. And that's what Bukhane is warning against. Anytime you let a bureaucratic elite take over, they will think of ways of how to reinforce the power for technology. And this has led to the rise of AI. Does it make sense? OK. And this is describing China very well. The bureaucrats in charge, they have no imagination. They have no empathy. All they care about is, okay, are we checking off the boxes? Do you have enough food to eat? Right, do you have a job? Well, if you have a house, if you have a job, you have health insurance, why are you complaining? Right? So that's what Buchanan is saying. All right, the last thing I want to talk about is this. And you brought this up earlier, okay? It's a great question is, the question we're looking at today is, why is China so similar to America? Right? America is a capitalist nation. China is a communist nation. But if you talk to Chinese people today, they all want to go to America to study, and possibly even to live. Chinese want to become American. So in many ways, America has conquered China. And so why is that the case? And the answer, and I mentioned this before, is it's because communism and capitalism reinforce each other. They share a similar ideology. They share a similar background. They're all actually branched of Christianity. Really, if you think about it. And they have a similar worldview, right? A belief in progress, a belief in past struggle, a belief that you need a technocratic elite to run the world, right? So in other words, communism in China paid the weight for American capitalism. And that's why today you have this going on, okay? What China is doing to children is unconscionable, right? Because we make kids sit in school for like 10 hours a day. They have no childhood, they have no freedom, they have no happiness. Mostly these kids will, they're up depression by age 14, right? The vast majority. Last week there was a huge news that a nine-year-old kid in Beijing killed himself. Nine years old. Yeah, jumped off a building. Nine years old. That's incredible because my eldest son, he's like seven, turning eight, okay? I can't, I mean, like how miserable did he have to be to wanna kill himself, right? Even if the kid succeeds and goes to like Beida or Qinghua, he'll develop depression because he'll never achieve what he wants in life, okay? So all that's happening is we're forcing our kids into depression, into suicide. Why? Because this has become an evil religion almost, right? To believe that for education, you can make more money. And even though everyone else will probably develop suicide, will probably develop suicide or depression or process, you won't, okay? That's, I'm betting you won't, okay? It's insane. I mean, what's happening in education today? it is unconscionable and evil what we're doing to our children in China. And what we're doing this is because in China we've combined communism and capitalism to create the worst possible society. All right, so yeah, any questions? Okay, so why is North Korea so poor? Okay, so that's part of the capitalist brainwashing, where you measure the success of society based on its wealth, okay? But wealth is really just the willingness to exploit your resources, okay? And also your capacity to engage in global trade. So first of all, North Korea is heavily sanctioned. They're not allowed to trade with the world, okay? That's the first problem. Second problem is they focus on, their religion is called self-reliance. They want to be independent of the world. So they purposely choose not to engage in the world in order to maintain the unity of their people. So that's why we call them the Hermit Kingdom. For them, what's important is to maintain their independence and sovereignty from the world. And but that does not mean people are not happy where they are. Okay, I would argue that even though China was a lot poorer during the Cultural Revolution, people were a lot happier during the Cultural Revolution than they are today. Maybe not us, okay? But for most ordinary Chinese, they were a lot happier during the Cultural Revolution than they are today because for them, life was simple and clear and certain. Today, you have globalization, you have the internet, You have noise. It's very confusing for people. And one piece of evidence is young people don't want to have any children today. Whereas in the cultural revolution, people do want to have children because they felt that regardless of poverty, people were going into a certain life. They had health care. They had a job guarantee for them. They had a sense of community. There was solidarity going on. So that really is the trick of capitalism. to make everyone think the same way, which is like money is everything. Does that make sense? Great. Any more questions? These are great questions, by the way. So thank you for asking them. Yeah. So was Marx too idealistic? Marx didn't think he was idealistic. He thought he was extremely realistic. Why? Because he was studying all this history. He was studying all this economics. And he was coming up with a scientific understanding of the world. Marx saw himself as a scientist, first and foremost. He saw himself as unveiling the truth to people. He was, did you understand? For him, it was science. It was certain. It was, it had to happen. Okay? But the thing about Marx is this. Marx is also a person that, if you were to like jump forward today, and he saw the world, created by communism and capitalism, he would be utterly disgusted. He wouldn't be like, oh wow, I'm famous now. I'm the most famous person, one most famous person in the world. I'm like Jesus, okay? He wouldn't be like that. He'd be like, what have we done to humanity? This is far worse than the Industrial Revolution, what's happening, where everyone now is a slave, as a consumer, right? In your mind, all that matters is, I go to school, I make a lot of money, I buy a lot of things, and that's it. And this would have been unimaginable to Marx and anyone actually 100 years ago. It's the fact that humanity has chosen to enslave themselves for no particular good reason. And so the question then we're looking at next class is why this happened? And what I'll show you next class is, Simone Freud had a lot to do with this. Psychology had a lot to do with this. Because before we were focused on the collective consciousness, right? The world as it is, the community. But with the coming of Freud and psychology, we now shift our focus to ourselves. So we come to believe that for our own internal struggle, we can be happy. Others don't matter. We ourselves, if we're happy, we're good. And what McKenon and Marx have taught us is, if everyone is unhappy, you must be unhappy as well. It's only if people are free and happy together can they be free and happy by themselves. And that's the thing that we've forgotten. And that's what's led to the world we live in today. But that's something that we'll discuss next class. Any more questions? Great, okay, so Freud, next class."}

So, this is gonna be a very long class today and I'm going to throw a lot of information at you. The reason why is I want to summarize and review what we've learned about Rome so far. Comparant contrast to the Greeks and I look forward on how the Romans and the Greeks will influence development of Washington civilization, including Christianity. Okay, so I'll be following a lot at you today. So if you have any questions, please let me know. If I'm being unclear, please let me know. Just raise your hand. All right, so let's review what we know so far. So the Romans and the Greeks are very different civilizations. If you remember the Greeks, the Greeks are scattered across the Aegean and across the Mediterranean. They have colonies over the place. So the Greeks are primarily focused on trade, especially with the great empires of the Near East, primarily Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Persia, the three great civilizations that we will discuss starting next week. And so the Greeks have colonies all over these three civilizations, and as such, the Greeks are able to absorb new ideas pretty easily. And because the Greeks are focused on trade, maritime trade, they're a very open-minded people. So that's Greek civilization. The Romans are completely different because they are across the Adriatic in Italy and they're inland. So there are much more insular and conservative people than the Greeks. Also, the Romans have historically been surrounded by very aggressive people, including the Latins, the Sabans, the Atricians. And so Rome has always had to struggle to survive in this very hostile environment. And in order to survive, they developed a cultural system that made them the world's greatest military machine. And the three pillars of this culture are piety, right? Piety, obedience and loyalty to the gods, to Rome and to your fathers. Second principle is that of liberty, which puts the nobility at the very heart and center of Roman society. Liberty means no kings, no dictators, no tyrants. And the third and most important pillar is the idea of republica, right? The public good. The idea here is everyone must sacrifice himself for the honor and glory of Rome. In fact, it was a competition. you want prestige by winning new territory for Rome. Okay? And this is a great system. If you are a poor, small nation, always at war and under threat from larger nations. So remember in 216 BCE, Hannibal destroyed every Roman army. But at the same time, the Romans were able to rally themselves and ultimately defeat Carthage in the Second Punic War. So it's a great system if you're a small and poor nation always at war with larger nations. But this system breaks down when you become rich, big empire, and you're the main major hegemon in the area. And this system will lead to three major problems in the Roman Republic, corruption, division, civil wars. The first one between Marius and Sola, and then between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and then finally between Octavian and Mark Anthony. And also inequality. So now the Rome is in crisis. And the ultimate resolution to all these problems was the beginning of the empire, okay, the emperor. So Octavian became the emperor. He is now known as Augustus Caesar. And again, what he does is he centralizes all military authority in his hands. Egypt is now his private estate, and he uses it to bankroll the army, which is now composed of professional soldiers. Before they were citizen soldiers, so they only volunteered when Rome was at war. But now in the empire, there's a professional-standing army and they serve for like 20 years or 30 years. And they're all paid by one man, the emperor, through his land holdings in Egypt. He also established something called the Pretorian Guard. And the patern guard is basically the secret police of Rome. Okay, so there are no soldiers in Rome, but there's a patern guard. They're responsible for peace and security in Rome. And they're only responsible to one man, the emperor. So even though Augustus Caesar has conquered Rome and basically most of the world, He still has three major problems that he must resolve if he is to be emperor folio, okay? The first problem he must solve is the question of legitimacy. Why is he emperor? And traditionally in the ancient world, your legitimacy comes from your family. How old is your family? How established is your family? Now, there are two major myths about the founding of Rome. The first is Romulus, right? The first king of Rome. The second is Lucius Brutus, in the founding of the Roman Republic. Now Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar are not, do not come from either of these two myths or families, okay? So he has to construct a new myth that shows that his family, called the Giuliai, go way back, they go back to before Romulus. So while he was alive, Julius Caesar planned the seeds of this. Remember, Julius Caesar is a great myth maker. So the myth he came up with is this. There is a man named Ineus. And Ineus is from Troy. When Troy was destroyed, Ineos was able to escape with some survivors and they came to Italy and they built the foundations that would become Rome. So in other words, Romulus is the Senate from Ineos, but Julius Caesar is also the Senate from Ineos. So that is how Augustus Caesar will cement his legitimacy by promoting the idea that his ancestor was Ineus, who is the real founder of Rome. Okay, so he's winning a new myth and he's trying to popularize it. So it's the first problem he's trying to solve, legitimacy. The second problem he's trying to solve is like a new Roman cultural identity. Okay, so remember the old Roman cultural identity was based on piety, liberty, and republican. And this creates problems if the emperor, because remember Marcus Brutus and Desmond Brutus, they thought that they were descendants of, sorry, they thought they were descendants of Lucius Brutus and therefore they had a responsibility to kill all kings, all tyrants. And that's why they assassinated Julius Caesar. So you can't allow this cultural identity to exist, right? Because it will encourage other Buddhists to come kill you, the emperor. So you have to change this. You have to get rid of the idea of liberty and rip up a car, okay? You have to promote a new Roman identity focus on obedience, piety and obedience. And then there's a third problem that Augustus Caesar must resolve as emperor, which is this. Even though the Romans have conquered most of the world, basically the Mediterranean world, culturally it's the Greeks who are dominant. Because the Greeks have a superior culture, they have Homer, they have Plato, they have Fusitides, they have Ischolists. So all Romans acknowledge the fact that Greek culture is superior. And as Romans embrace Greek culture, Augustus Caesar believes they are corrupted. For Augustus Caesar, he believes that Greek culture, it is too hedonistic. And that's ultimately what happened to Mark Anthony. Mark Anthony was this good Roman who went off to Egypt. and we can corrupt it and seduce by Cleopatra and Greek culture. Mark M. became more Greek, and that's why he betrayed Rome. I guess the Caesar also believed that's why Rome began to send it into civil wars because Rome was starting to embrace Greek culture and it made everyone more individualistic, more hedonistic, more selfish, and that's why they fought these civil wars. Okay, so Augustus Caesar now has to somehow destroy Greek culture, or the influence of Greek culture on the Roman soul. And he knows the very essence, the very basis of Greek culture is Homer, especially the Iliad and the Odyssey. These two books were essentially the Bible of Greek civilization. This is how children were educated. When they were young, they memorized the Iliad and they memorized the Odyssey. And that's what taught them how to speak well, how to think well, and how to debate well. Okay? So Augustus Caesar understands that to defeat Homer, he needs to have another. He needs to create a Roman epic to replace Homer in the schools. So he invited a man named Virgil, who at this time is considered the greatest living Roman poet to write another epic in Latin, to replace Homer as a cornerstone of the education system. And he wrote something called the Iñad, which is really about the journey of Iñas as he creates Rome, as he found Rome. So from 29 BCE until 19 BCE, for about over 10 years, Virgil worked on the Ineat under the direct supervision of Augustus Caesar. So they were basically co-authors. Virgil was a poet. He was the one who could put the words together. But it was Augustus Caesar who had the vision of what the Ineat should be. And the Ineat will accomplish all three of these major challenges. It will establish the primacy of the July family as the first family of Rome. It will establish a new Roman cultural identity focused on piety over liberty. And it will show that Greek culture is one of corruption and hedonism. And it must be repelled, okay? So you can make the argument that Virgil's Iniad is the greatest work of propaganda ever in human history. So that's what I will show you today, okay? To do this, what I will do is compare and contrast the Iliad and the Odyssey with the Iniad to show you how different the Roman worldview is from the Greek worldview, okay? So before I start, I need questions about this framework. Is this clear to you? Okay, all right. So let's start with the Iliad. Okay, and remember, this is a very important idea. Homer and Virgil are two different individuals. They're both poets. But Homer was writing when crystallization was just beginning. So he's trying to create the seeds of civilization. He's trying to be a great teacher. Virgil is writing when Rome is an empire that is everywhere and everything. It's basically God. So he's trying to teach people how to be part of this empire. Do you understand? So you can argue that Homer is an educator, whereas Virgil is a propagandist. Let's talk about the Iliad. So the first thing is, the Iliad is a very complicated work. It's a universe onto itself with like dozens of characters. I'm only gonna focus on one character, Achilles, and tell his story, okay? But please be aware, The story I'm telling, it is my interpretation. There are different interpretations. But it is the one interpretation found within the universe of the Iliad. So the basic story, it's very simple. Helen is the queen of Sparta, Mary, to the king of Sparta, Menelaus. She is seduced by the prince of Troy named Paris. They fall in love and they run off together to Troy. Menelaus and his brother, again, Menelaus, they raised an army to rescue Helen, or to retrieve Helen back from the children, to refuse to give her up. And what follows is a 10-year siege of Troy. And the Greeks aren't really getting anywhere, because Troy, it is the largest city in the world at this time. It's a walled city, and the Greeks don't know how to break through the Trojan walls. The Aelites starts when Achilles, who is the greatest warrior of the Greeks, he gets into a fight with Achaemenon. They get into a fight and Achilles calls Achaemenon a dog. You insult me, I fight for you, I will not refuse to fight for you. I will let the Trojans kill all of you. And your agon manon, the king, wants to say face, so he tells Achilles, I don't need you, okay? But in fact, the Greeks do need Achilles because the children have a great warrior named Hector. And Hector recognizes that Achilles has retired from the battlefield and Hector leads his army against the Greeks, okay? And they push the Greeks so far back the Greeks are now trapped in on their ships by the coast. And what Hector wants to do is burn down these ships. Because if he burns down these ships, the Greeks cannot, we supply themselves and they will eventually die in Troy, okay? So at this point, Aegean Mennon has no choice but to beg Achilles to return to the battlefield because only Achilles can defeat Hector in battle. But Aegean Mennon doesn't want to lose face. So he sends a delegation of generals, led by a man named Odysseus, to beg Achilles to return to the battlefield. So Odysseus goes and sees Achilles in a ship, and Odysseus says, listen Achilles, we're dying out here. If you don't fight for us, we're gonna die. Hector is destroying us. If you fight for us, Akemanon will give you everything, okay? All these treasures we are promised in Troy will give to you. Akemanon will give you anything you want. He'll give you the world. And Achilles, because he's an asshole, says, no, I want Akemanon to come back me himself, okay? So this goes nowhere. And Akemanon refuses to come back, So the Trojan's events further and further and about to burn the ships. Petroclas see his best friends with Achilles and he sees that Achilles is conflicted because Achilles wants to jump into the fray. Achilles had a prophecy before he came to Troy, okay? And the prophecy is this, he has a choice. He can either choose to die an old man at home and be a nobody or come to Troy die young at battle in the battle and be remembered forever as the greatest champion of the Greeks. And for Achilles, that's not a choice because for him as a warrior, he loves to fight. He can only achieve Eurymonia in battle. Okay? So for him to sit in a ship and watch the Greeks being destroyed, it is the worst punishment on earth. By the same time Achilles, he's arrogant, he's vain, and he demands Egan Menon to come apologize. Which Egan Menon's not gonna do, okay? Egan Menon would rather see the entire Greek army demolish than to apologize to Achilles. So Protocolis tells Achilles, listen, let me jump into the battle to save the ships. And Achilles says, fine, I will let you stop the Trojan advance, but do not, under any circumstances, fight Hector in battle. So a protocollist jumps into battle and he fights the Trojans, and then what does he do? He fights Hector, right? And then what happens? He gets killed. Achilles hears what the death of a protocollist, and Achilles is so angry at the death of his best friend, that if he forgives Achaemenon, he lets go of his anger at Achaemenon and directs it at Hector. He jumps into battle, he challenges Hector to a duel, and he kills Hector. Then what he does is he takes Hector's dead body, he ties it to his chariot, and then he drags Hector's body around the walls of Troy. And on top of the walls of Troy are Hector's parents, King Priam and Queen Hecuba. And they are screaming in anguish. They hate this devil who not only killed their son Hector, but now is now humiliating and mutilating him in front of the entire Trojan people. OK? So at this point, you would think that Achilles has achieved immortality. He's the deputy Hector in battle. He saved the Greek army and he'd be very happy. But it turns out he falls into a deep depression. He cannot sleep. He cannot eat. All he does is think about protroclists. But he's so depressed, he can't even cry for protroclists. So this is where Homer is really the first psychology. because Achilles is feeling this way because he is wrapped with guilt. If you think about it, it wasn't Hector who killed Protocolis, it was Achilles who killed Protocolis. Why? Because Protocolis wouldn't be dead if A, Achilles did not get that stupid fight with Agamemnon, Okay? B, Achilles just forgave Agamonon when Odysseus came begging, okay? And C, if Achilles did not agree for the protocolis to go into battle, okay? So, without knowing it, because Achilles lacks self-awareness, he is trapped by his guilt over the death of the protocolis. and he is taking out his rage on Hector, okay? He is supposed to return Hector's body for ransom to the Trojans because everyone believes at this time that the dead can only find peace in the afterlife if they're buried, okay? So for Achilles to torment Hector's body like this is means that Hector can never find peace in the afterlife. His father, Priam, is back in Troy, and he can't sleep either, because he's depressed over what's happened to his son. So eventually the gods broker a peace deal, okay? And they tell Prime to go to Achilles, and Achilles will return the body to Priam. So late one night, Prime sneaks into the tent, and he's standing behind Achilles, who is busy discussing military matters with his generals. Now at this point, Priam can take out a knife and stab Achilles to death. And he wants to because he's so angry at this man who's killed and mutilated his son Hector. Instead, and this is the genius of Homer, okay? Priam kneels down and kisses the hand of Achilles. Achilles, the man who has killed his beloved son. And in response, Achilles stands and he is in all of this old man who at this moment has demonstrated more courage, more strength than Achilles has ever witnessed. So in this act of submission, Priam has emotionally defeated Achilles. Achilles is ashamed of himself. And by forgiving Achilles, Prime allows Achilles to now forgive himself. Does that make sense to you? And so the two then start to become friends because in the face of Priam, Achilles This sees his father, Pilius, and he pities Priam for having lost his son. And in the face of Achilles, Priam sees his son Hector, and they both hug and they cry. And this is the first time that Achilles has been able to cry since the death of the protocrats. And these tears release him from the ghost of the protocrats who is haunting him. And this is how the Iliad ends. we've witnessed in the Iliad is the character transformation of Achilles from a cold-blooded merciless, vain and arrogant warrior into a man who is capable of pity, self-reflection, and self-forgiveness. And you can argue that this is a process of civilization. And so the point of the Iliad is even though it's about war, it's really making the argument that love is the basis of civilization. It is what unites us and inspires us. Love is the unifying force of the universe, right? Even though Prime and Achilles are the most bitter enemies, because of Prime's love for Hector and because of Achilles' love for his father Pilius, They're able to find common ground and become friends. That's the Iliad. Does that make sense? So again, it is arguably the greatest work of literature in human history. And this is only one interpretation. There are different interpretations. But you can see how rich and complex, sophisticated the Iliad is. It is, if you by reading it, you'll be inspired to reimagine yourself in the world around you. That's how powerful it is. All right, now let's move on to the Odyssey. The Iliad is about Achilles and its transformation into self-awareness. The Odyssey is about Odysseus. And unlike Achilles, Odysseus does not want to go to the Children of War. Achilles jumps at a chance to win glory at Troy. But this year was giving a different was giving a prophecy which is this if he goes to Troy He'll be gone for 20 years. He lives in Ithaca With his wife Pinappi and they just had a newborn son Tamaqus Okay, and the prophecy is you go to Troy you'll be gone for 20 20 years 10 years at Warren Troy 10 years lost at sea and now this he is who loves his family does not want to go to war So he pretends to be crazy, insane. And so what he does is he takes salt and a plow. And he plows the field and salts it, which kills the field, okay? So clearly this is a sign of insanity. But the Greek soldiers who come to retrieve him are determined to get him because they know that Odysseus is the most strategic and the wisest of the Greeks. He will be the one who will deliver victory to the Greeks in Troy because Odysseus will come up with a Trojan horse strategy. It is his idea, the Trojan horse strategy. So they need him. So to test him, to see if he's really mad, they put his son, Talakes, who's only like six months old in front of him, okay? So if he's really crazy, he would run over his son. If he's not crazy, then he would stop. And obviously he's had to run over his son, okay? So his trick has been revealed and he's forced to go to war. And he hates going to war, okay? But he's determined to win the war for the Greeks. The first reason is he believes the Trojans are unjust. How dare you steal another man's wife, right? Second reason is he wants to build a legacy for his son, Tamakis, right? He wants to go home to Ithaca and tell his son what a hero he is. He wants to build a legacy for his son. The third thing is he wants to reunite the family, which has been broken, right? Menelah and Helen, just as he wants to return to his wife, Penalpia. So this is what we call his worldview, the way he understands the world. And the worldview is what allows us to be human and to exist, right? The worldview explains to us who we are, what do we want, and what we should do. The problem is after Odysseus comes up with a horse, they sneak into the city and they open the gates, The Greeks come flooding in, okay? And now it's total mayhem because the Greeks are killing everyone inside the city. Odysseus kills a Trojan soldier who's attacking him. The Trojan soldier falls to the ground and then suddenly his wife screams at the death of her husband and she comes and sobs at the body of her dead husband, okay? And this creates something called cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is when the worldview and the reality do not match. There's conflict between the reality and the worldview. Remember, Odysseus came to Troy for justice, to build a legacy for his son, Tamakis, and to reunite a family. And what he's doing now is destroying families. The Greeks are just mass occurring everyone. It's not justice, it's just slaughter. It just complete mayhem. And so what happens is Odysseus is traumatized by what he sees. And this is what we call PDSD, right? Post-traumatic stress order. And after Troy, Odysseus becomes lost at sea. He becomes like a sex slave to a goddess in Calypso. So he stuck on an island for seven years, and there's a goddess called Clipso who's trapped him, and he's basically like a sex slave. And every day, when he's not having sex with Clipso, which sucks, he's crying on the beach. He has PTSD, and he doesn't even want to go home because he's ashamed to face his family. He's so ashamed by what's happened in Troy, he cannot face his family. So he's just stuck where he is. Meanwhile, at home, Penelope, his wife, she is waiting for him to return. But after some time, people think, oh, this is, must be dead. So there's about 100 young men, 100 suitors, who come and demand her hand in marriage. Okay? But she refuses to believe, oh, this is dead. So she falls into depression as well. She's waiting for her husband to return, but all the signs are that he's dead. She's been courted by hundreds of suitors, and she can't say no to any of them, because she's afraid her husband is really dead, and she doesn't want to be alone. So she becomes depressed as well. She becomes paralyzed. So she's stuck. This means that Tamakis, the son, is stuck as well. And he becomes a depressed teenager because if Odysseus were dead, he would inherit his legacy. He could become his own man, but Odysseus is not dead yet. No one knows if he's dead or alive. So he's stuck where he is. If Vanellope were just to marry and go somewhere else, he would inherit the property, right? But she's just stuck in a room. So he's depressed as well. So this entire family, okay? It's depressed. Odysseus is depressed. Penelope, Tamaquist, they're all depressed. So they're just stuck there. Athena, who is the goddess of wisdom, okay? And she favors Odysseus. Athena sees all this from up high Mount Olympus, and she pities the family. And she resolves to bring the family back together again. So she goes and tells Clip, so hey, you've had your fun, But you have to let Odysseus go, okay? So now Odysseus is free to go home. And Athena tells Odysseus, listen, do not, when you go home, you can tell Tamakis who you are, but don't tell Penelope and anyone else who you are, because you might be killed, okay? There's a hundred suitors who would kill you if they knew who you were. So Athena disguises him as a different person, as a beggar basically, beggar. And when Odysseus returns to Ithaca, the first thing he wants to know is, does Penelope still love him? Remember, Odysseus is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, okay? He's lost his ability to fight, to imagine. He's lost his capacity for love. So he doesn't even know if his wife still loves him. So he meets with Penelope, okay? And again, he's still this guy. Penelope has no idea who he is. And he cannot reveal himself to Penelope. But he sees Penelope as a strut. And he tries to comfort Penelope by telling her that he has seen Odysseus. Odysseus is still alive. Penelope breaks down in tears at the thought that her husband is still alive. And then she asks Odysseus, how do you know my husband is still alive? Prove to me that you've met my husband. Now Odysseus says, I will describe something intimate about him. Okay, he has a brooch that he carries on his cloak. And this brooch is beautiful. And he goes into poetic detail and describes this brooch. And at this point, when Penelope hears this, she breaks down in complete tears, because now she knows this beggar must be my husband Odysseus in disguise. How does she know? Because only Odysseus would know all the details of the brooch. What is the brooch? The brooch is what Penelope gave Odysseus as Odysseus set sail for Troy, right? It is Penelope's gift to him and it is Audis' promise to her that he will return. So even though Audis has lost the brooch in war, and at sea, the brooch is implanted in his mind. The brooch symbolizes his everlasting love for Penelope. So now like Penelope knows Audis' has returned, they still have to figure out how to get rid of these hundred suitors, okay, how to kill them. Because they're still a threat to the family. So, Panabbi has this great plan, okay? She's gonna organize an archery contest. Audisius has a bow. If the suitors can string the bow and shoot a target, then Panabbi will mirror that shooter. So she organizes competition, and all the hundred suitors, they fail one by one. Okay, they cannot string the bow together. Then the beggar, who is Odysseus, says, let me try. And the moment he strings the ball together, the suitors are afraid. Because they know this can only be Odysseus. Only Odysseus can string the ball together and use it. And then one by one Odysseus takes his ball and he kills all the suitors. What the ball symbolizes is his identity, who he is. The ball, by stringing it together, It represents the resurrection, the stream together of his worldview. Okay? He now remembers that he's a father, a hero, who fights for justice. He fights to protect his family. That's who he is really. Okay? And so it is a, this story is the power of love to heal trauma after war. And again, the main message is love is the unifying, unifying force of the world. It is what will heal you. It is what will bring people together. Okay, so that's the Iliad in the honesty. Does that make sense? And again, the argument is love is a basis of civilization. It is the thing that makes us human. It is what gives us our strength, our courage, our power. Okay, so are you clear about the Iliad in the honesty in the audience before I move on to the Iliad. Any questions? Okay, let's do the Iliad. Okay, so neither the Iliad or the audience talks about the Trojan horse. But the Iliad, the first thing it does is talk about the Trojan horse. So the Trojans wake up one day and they find this huge Trojan horse, wooden horse, outside their gates. And most are like, this must be a Greek trick. Let's just burn it down, okay? But then they capture a Greek soldier. And this Greek soldier is very eloquent. With logic and with building or power, he tells a false story of how the Greeks became disheartened by the progress of the war and they decide to sell home. And to ensure their safe journey home, they built a wooden horse for the gods to win their favor. And the story is so moving and so beautiful that childrens believe him. And they let the childrens' horse in. So the Iliad is not a subtle as the Iliad or the Odyssey. It's propaganda. So what this is telling us is this. The real children's horse is Greek culture, logic, philosophy, and theater. That's what Greek culture is, logic, philosophy, and theater. And that's what the Greek culture uses in order to manipulate the Trojans, to lie to them. So the message here is, if we Romans embrace Greek culture, embrace logic, philosophy, and theater, then our culture will be destroyed. The real Trojan horse is Greek culture. Therefore, we must resist it at all costs. So Enius wakes up and he finds the city in flames. The Greeks are going around massacring everyone, okay? So Enius goes and he tries to save Priam. He runs to the palace and Priam is on his throne and he sees one of his sons being killed by Achilles' son, Neo-Pollimus, okay? Neo-Pollimus. And Prime Cursed Neil Ptolemies. And he says, your father, you insult the honor of your father. Your father was an honorable man. We were friends. And then Neato List goes up to Prime and kills him and says, my father is dead. You should join him in the underworld. It is a horrific scene. So what this is telling us, again, this is not subtle. There is no place for love, friendship, and forgiveness. That's all a lie. It's all just trickery, okay? Only brutality and force will triumph in the end. Ineos is trying to say prime, but then prime dies. And then he discovers that hiding somewhere, he sees Helen, okay? And he thinks that Helen is the one responsible for all of this. She's a whore. She's a slut. If she just did her duty, if she just stayed at home where she was supposed to be, this world would have started. So he really wants to kill her. In fact, he is about to kill her. Then suddenly a goddess named Venus. Also, so the women call her Venus. The Greeks call her Aphrodite. And she is the mother of Ineos. She appears before her son and says, my son, you're destined for greater things. Leave Helen. Return to your family. So Ineos has no toys, but to obey his mother. And he runs home. And he sees that his family is fine. His son is in the jeweless. He has a father and a wife. And they're fine. So he's like, OK, you guys are fine. I'm gonna go and kill some Greeks. I'm gonna die with the city. I'm gonna fight until my dying breath to save my city. And the wife and the father are begging him to not go because you are one man against an entire army. You're gonna get killed. But Indias is stubborn and he's angry right now. Suddenly, Julius here is on fire and it's like a golden crown, okay? And the father says, you see, Ineos, this is a sign. This is a sign that your son will be the founder of a great empire. We know this empire to be called Rome. And this is what stops Ineos from committing suicide. It's like, OK, now I understand. It is my duty to save my son, my family. So he carries his father, who is unable to walk. He carries his son and he carries both of them to safety. They're looking for ships, okay? His wife follows behind. They get to the ship and he shows around and he discovers his wife, it has disappeared. He goes back and he's discovered that his wife has killed herself. Why? Because she knows that in this new world that they're going to, she can only be a hindrance. She wants him to embrace the future and let go of the past. Also, she's afraid that if she lives, she'll be captured and become a slave to the Greeks. And she does not want to dishonor him like that. So that's what a good wife is, right? That's a bad wife because she's independent and she's looking for love. But a good wife is someone who will kill herself for her husband. So, in he is, and there's people, They're on ships and they end up in Carthage. And their guest of a queen named Diddle. And Diddle falls in love with Ineos. They get married and Ineos is very happy in Carthage. The God, look at Ineos and says, hey man, we told you this many times, but you have a destiny to go to Rome. Your son will be the founder of a great empire. That's the plan, that's the destiny. That's your mission, that's your duty. Stop fooling around in Carthage and do what you're told. So Carthage, so Ineus has to go see Ditto and say, listen, I have to go, okay? And Ditto goes insane because she's in love with Ineus. She kills herself, okay? So the message here, again, this is not subtle, okay? The message here is love is a disease, right? Love is a disease a plague upon the world. It was Helen's love that caused the children war. It was Ditto's love for Ineas that will cause the war between Carthage and Rome. Because before she dies, Ditto instructs her people to destroy Rome. In the future, a great city called Rome will arise. You, the Carthage people, have a responsibility to honor my memory and destroy Rome. And that's why Hannibal went to attack Rome. Again, this is that subtle propaganda. Ineos ends up in Italy, like he's supposed to. And there he meets the local king. His name is Latinus. And he's the king of the Latinus. And he is mesmerized, stunned by the nobility of Ineos. And he wants his daughter to marry Ineos. But his daughter has already, is already supposed to marry another prince called Churnus. And this starts a war between Ineos and Churnus. And this war goes on for a very long time. It's like the Iliad. And Churnus kills one of Ineos' friends, okay? Okay? And he sees that the friend of Ineas has this really nice belt. He takes it for himself. And this belt was a gift from Ineas to his friend. Okay? Eventually, Ineas and Churnis get into a duel. And Ineas overpowers Churnis. And at the very last minute, Churnis gives up, surrenders to the sword and begs for mercy. And the Indian wants to show mercy. He's like, I've beaten you, you're no longer a threat. I can show some forgiveness, okay? I can be merciful. But then he sees the belt that he gave his friend. And he knows, Cherness has killed his friend. And so he just plunges his spear into Cherness. And that's how the Indian ends, okay? Now, the Indian is very confusing for scholars because it's pretty awful. And so scholars have debated whether or not Virgil was able to finish the Iniad. And the argument is the ending is too abrupt, and therefore Virgil couldn't have finished the Iniad. It's unfinished. But you think about it, it is finished. Because remember in the Iliad, we see a character transformation of Achilles. But we also see a character transformation of Ineos in this book. So remember, when Ineos sees Helen, he really wants to kill her. And he only stopped because the gods intervened. Remember, Ineos wanted to abandon his family and get killed in the streets of Troy. The gods have to send him a message. So another divine intervention. Remember, Ineos wanted to stay at Carthage and be with Diddle. So the Greeks had to send a messenger to tell him you can't do that. You have to fulfill your destiny and go to Troy, sorry, and go to Rome. But at the very end, when Ineos wanted to kill, when Ineos wanted to kill Ternes, the gods didn't have to intervene. He wanted to show mercy to Charnes, and he recognized, no, my duty is to kill this guy. You understand? So, Ines has become the embodiment of piety and duty. Before, the gods had to instruct him to do his duty. Now he recognizes what his duty is. He embraces it. Now, what's important for us is to remember that throughout this book, there's the idea of destiny. that what Ines is doing has been preordained by the gods because the real purpose of Ines is to go to Rome so that his son can build the Roman Empire. So another major message of this book is the endpoint of history is Augustus Caesar. Everything that is happening is to move towards converge to Augustus Caesar because Augustus Caesar will create the Pax Romana, what we call the Roman peace, which is the idea of eternal peace, peace on earth. Remember that before Augustus Caesar, there were all these civil wars that were killing millions of people, right? Well, after Augustus Caesar became emperor, there is now the Pax Romana, eternal peace on earth. And this is the end point of history. The Roman Empire will mean they will no longer be any wars. They will no longer be any conflicts. Why? Because what the Roman Empire will do is transition us from love to piety. Homer believed that love is the basis of civilization. What the Roman Empire will show us is that piety is the basis of civilization. Love is the force that comes within you, okay? It grows within you, within. But piety is what is told to you, okay? It is what you must accept. Love is what you can feel. Love is the embrace of your emotions. Piety means the rejection of your emotions. Don't listen to your feelings, listen to what you are told. By embracing your emotions, You have imagination. But Piety believes imagination is destructive. What matters is stability and harmony. Stability. Stability and obedience is what will give peace to the world. So for Homer, love is the unifying force of the universe. But for Virgil, love is the force that creates conflict in the universe. Think of Helen, think of Diddle. For Homer, the imagination is the animating force of the universe. It is what gives life. But for Virgil, the imagination is the destructive force of the universe. It is what destroys. It's basically you disobey that creates chaos and conflict. And so we now have a transition from the Greek world to the Roman world that is focused on piety. What virtue is trying to create is the idea of eternity, right, eternity. Something that lasts forever. What Homer is trying to create is the idea of infinity, how we can create the world through our actions and emotions, right. In the Pax Romana, on Nagasa Caesar, all you have to do is obey and the world will be perfect. We have come to the end of history. History has stopped because we have found the perfect, we have found perfection. We have found the perfect model to organize human civilization. We are the perfection. We are the end. OK. And so this is the idea of Roman eternity. And this marks a radical transition in Western civilization. Does that make sense? Any questions? One last point is this. The Romans were the most non-creative people in the world. They were anti-creative. So even though they had, they saw from somewhere else. somewhere else, OK? So the question then is, where did they get the idea of eternity from? Here you guess, Egypt. Next class, I will show you that the Romans are using the Egyptian sense of eternity. So I know this is a lot to take in. So feel free to ask for clarification on any point, OK? Are you OK with this? Sure. Well, I guess the Caesar wants them to reject culture, but they cannot reject great culture because it's so powerful. So this lecture is not about what happens in reality. This lecture is about the new conception of reality as introduced by the Roman Empire. But eventually this will become the new reality, but it will take time. So looking ahead, the Romans will introduce a new idea that will make piety and obedience the cornerstone of society Okay, this idea is called Christianity Hey, look ahead, right? I like this is not happening right right now because the Roman Conception is not as appealing as a Greek conception but eventually the Romans will create a new religion called Christianity that will dominate and and make piety the cornerstone of society and civilization. But looking ahead, any questions? Okay, so next class, we will discuss Egypt."}

Today we will do Genghis Khan and the Mongolian conquest. Now, as you know, the Mongols have a terrible reputation for their brutality, for their atrocities. Today I want to make the argument to you that what they did, given the circumstances, given the constraints they were under, was actually logical and understandable. Okay? So that's the argument I will make to you today. All right, so the Mongols. The Mongols, as you know, they are a step people. The step are divided into the Western steps and the Eastern steps. steps. And they basically go from Hungary in Europe all the way to what is modern-day Mongolia. And as we discussed, step culture is very different from agricultural culture that we find in the Lavaan, in Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and in China. In the grasslands, the economy is what we call nomadic pastoral, meaning they will raise cattle as their source of food and they will travel wherever there is grassland. And because of their economy, they have developed a certain culture. They are extremely violent. Their society, their culture is based around violence. And there's a lot of competition within these certain groups. So, when I think of these people as a nation or race of people, it's better to think them as a culture. Okay, and for the longest time throughout human history they have been divided among many different tribes. Throughout human history the nomadic pastoral people of the steppes have always been in conflict with the agricultural empires. So in response the agricultural empires, China and the Persians, they have built walls and fortifications to counter their threat. Okay? So as you can see, the Mongols will eventually come south and invade most of China and historically the response has been the Great Wall of China. Okay? But also in Central Asia, the steppe people have been a threat as well and they have have built fortified cities as response. So even though the steppe people and their agricultural empires have always been in conflict, the Mongols have had a unique reputation in Western history as the most brutal, as the most violent. So the question we're looking at today is why were the Mongols unique in their brutality? So there are lots of things that were set up with the Mongols that we now know today are not true. So for example, back in the day, they had a reputation for cannibalism. They ate their opponents, they ate their enemies, and we know that's not true today. They also had a reputation for being devious. So for example, when they approached an enemy, they would hold the cross. Okay, the cross is a symbol of Christianity. So the Christian enemies would see this and think that they are allies. Okay, and only when they discovered that these are actually Mongols, by then it was much too late. Okay, so the Mongols had a reputation for being extremely devious. They had a reputation for wanton brutality. They would destroy entire cities and kill all the people. Previously, historians believed they killed about 65 million people. Today, that figure is disputed. But if that were the case, then the Mongols killed more people than any other regime in human history before the 20th century. Genghis Khan is considered the greatest conqueror in human history. So the statistic that surprised everyone is one out of 200 males today, they're directed the Senate of Genghis Khan. So that's our 16 million people, okay? 16 million males in the world are direct descendants of Genghis Khan. So that is the reputation that the Mongols had for most of history. And what I want to show you today is the Mongols are not unique among the steps people. And the way they behave, there was a strategy. There's a logic to the way they behave. Given the circumstances and constraints, they found themselves under. Okay, so as you know in this class, the steppe people were the greatest conquerors in human history. So let's start with the Amnaya, who were based in the Ukraine area. And we know the Amnaya, who are also referred to as the proto-Indo-Europeans, as well as the Aryans. They spread throughout most of the Western world. So they went to Europe, And as we, as you know, they basically replaced entire male population of Europe. And they intermarried with the local woman to create European culture. They also went south and conquered Iran and India. And then they went over to the Eastern steppes as well. So it's really important for us to remember, And I know this is hard, but the Mongol people, they are culturally more similar to the Yamnaya than they are to the Chinese. Even though genetically, the Mongols may be more similar to the Chinese. In this class, we focus on cultural values rather than genetic affinity. So over time, what will happen to the Western steppes is it will slowly acclimatize itself to the surrounding agricultural empires. And slowly the Western steppes will become integrated into the agricultural, into the agricultural neighbors. So the example here is Siphiya. Okay, so Siphiya is slowly, it's an empire, it's a steppe empire, but slowly it's about to integrate itself into what is modern day Eurasia. From the Scythians, you will have a rise, something called the Median Empire, which will then give way to the Persian Empire. Over in the Eastern steppes, the steppe people come to conflict with the Han dynasty. And the Han dynasty, as we know from last class, is really the last ethnically Chinese dynasty. and they are intent on a policy of eradication against the step people. So they come into conflict with the step people who are now called the shu nu, okay? And what this conflict will do is drive these people west. Okay? And this is interesting for us because when they go west, they will splinter off into different groups. When they go all the way to Europe, they'll be known as the Huns. Okay, you may know Attila the Hun. Well, Attila Han is what was the leader of these people. The Huns will drive the Western-Steppe people, meaning the Gauls, into the Roman Empire, causing conflict with the Roman Empire, okay? And the Gauls will become the foundation of modern-day Europeans. Okay? So this is the Hun Empire at its peak when it's in conflict with the Roman Empire. The step people, the Huns, will also give rise to a bill called the Gortuk Empire. And they will sweep down and they will become the Seljuk Turks, which will take over Mesopotamia. And then eventually you will have emerged the Ottoman Empire from these people. So in other words, the Mongols are just the most successful iteration of the steppe people and their conflicts with the agricultural empires. So the Mongol Empire is the second largest empire ever in human history. Only the British Empire had more land. The Mongols were the largest contiguous empire, meaning it was all interconnected together. At its height, the Mongol Empire extended from basically what is modern day Russia all the way to China. The empire that will take over the Mongols centuries later is the Russian Empire. Russian Empire will take over a lot of Mongol territory. Because it is so large, after the death of Genghis Khan and his son, Agade, the Mongol Empire was splintered into four major empires. And these four major empires themselves will assimilate and integrate into the local culture. The Golden Horde will eventually give rise to the Russian Empire. The Yuan Dynasty will eventually fall and give rise to the Ming Empire. So even though they conquer a lot of territory, ultimately their empire is not sustainable. And later on, I will explain to you why it was not sustainable and why ultimately the Mongol Empire declined. But while it was still in place, it creates something called the Pax Monagolica. This is Latin for the Mongol Peace. You've heard of the Pax Romana. We are now living in the Pax Americana. So the Mongols created something called the Pax Monagolica, which is meant they believed in globalization. They wanted their concord nations to trade with each other because they could collect taxes on the trade and they encouraged people, especially merchants, to travel across their empire and trade with each other. And during this time, a very famous Italian named Marco Polo had a chance to visit the world and his travels, especially those to China, captured the imagination of Europeans. This is really the first time that China figured into the European imagination. So this is a map of Marco Polo's travels. And as you can see, he basically traveled all across the Pax-Mangolica. The problem though is that when you integrate the war like this, you also give rise to disease. So the Black Death traveled all across the world. So we believe the Black Death originated in Central Asia in a place we call Kazakhstan today. And it traveled all over the Mongol Empire. It made its way to Europe, and it devastated Europe. It killed anywhere between a third to half of the entire population of Europe. It traveled also to the former Islamic Empire, and it traveled to China, but it was not as devastating. It's very important for us to understand. The Black Death was devastating for Europe, but it was not that devastating for China and the Islamic Empire. And the reason why is sanitation and hygiene. So in China and in the former Islamic Empire, their cities were pretty well organized, pretty wealthy, pretty civilized. But in Europe, the streets were literally filled with manure, okay? They had horses, they didn't have sanitation, people just threw shit onto the streets. And so like when you walk the streets, they were literally covered with shit. And in natural environment, diseases spread very rapidly. But the Black Death is important for us also because it will give rise to the Renaissance, which we'll do next week, okay? So, rather Black Death historians believe the Renaissance could not have happened. The Black Death basically meant a reset of European society and allowed massive innovation in Europe, okay? So as you can see, the Black Death was extremely devastating for Europe. After the Mongols will come another great conqueror called Timber Lane. And he will be the last great conqueror from the steppes. After Timber Lane, the agricultural empires will develop the technology to repel the steppe invaders, mainly gunpowder. The technology and mass armies will overwhelm the steppe people. And eventually, over time, the agricultural nations, mainly Russia, will start to to colonize and conquer the steps. Okay, so let's look at today at Geng's Khan, who is the founder of the Mongol Empire. Geng's Khan will, first of all, unite the warring tribes of the Mongol people. He'll turn them into a confederation, and then the confederation will aim to conquer China, but then it will come into conflict with the Central Asian nations. And so, Genghis Khan would embark on the Central Asian campaigns that are brutal. He'll wipe out entire cities, he'll kill all the inhabitants. They will lay the foundation for the Mongol conquest that will follow after him. Okay? And again, after the death of his son, Ogedei, the Mongols were split into four major factions and they will attempt to continue the legacy of conquest. But what happened is after they conquered the Song Empire in 1279, they will attempt to conquer Japan and Vietnam. And when they try to do so, they will be repelled. They try to conquer Japan twice. And even though the legend is that Japan was saved by the Kamikaze, right, the great divine wind, I will show you that's actually not true. There's another reason why the Mongols stopped invading Japan. So in the East, they've reached a limit of their conquest. They tried to conquer India as well, but when they tried to do so, they were repelled. And historians argue about the reason why this is the case. Some believe it was because of the climate of India. Some believe it was because of some, because the Southern of Delhi had a organized and concerted response. Some other believe it was just internal fighting, okay? When they try to reach Europe, they will try to conquer Poland and Hungary, and even though they win every single battle against the Poles and Hungarians, they will ultimately turn back, and that will be the limit of their conquest in the West. So the Mongolian fighting style is great when you fight in flat planes, okay? These are horsemen with bows, okay? So they're fast, they can cover great distances. But when they try to reach Europe, and Europe is thick forest, right? They really can't conquer that terrain. One really stunning event is when they try to conquer Egypt. Remember, Egypt for the longest time was the wealthiest part of the Western world. But when they try to conquer Egypt, they run into a people called the Mamluks, who fight very similarly to the Mongols. In fact, the Mamluks originally from the steppes as well. And for the first time, the Mongols will be defeated militarily on the battlefield. And this sort of destroys the aura of inevitability and invincibility that the Mongols had for the longest time. And this will be the extent of their conquest in the West. And after these conquests, the Mongol Empire will try to rule their respective empires. But ultimately, they will fail. And later on, I'll explain to you why they were doomed to fail. And the irony is the reasons that gave rise to the empire also the reasons why their empire ultimately collapsed. Okay, so I wanna first talk about Genghis Khan. And so we don't know much about Genghis Khan. What we do know comes from a book called The Secret History of the Mongols. So it is an oral history of the life and times of Genghis Khan and his son, Ogade. Now, the story in the secret history is suspicious. And it's suspicious because it fits very well into the structure of proto-Indo-European myth. So let me show you how it's similar. Okay, in the secret history, Genghis Khan, his mother, and again, they are in the Mongolian grasslands. His mother is about to be wed to her husband. So she's in her carriage and she's along the way to her husband's tribe. But along the way she is ambushed and kidnapped. That's a very common thing in that culture. The way that you obtain a wife is by stealing someone else's wife. And so she's forced to marry a stranger. But the stranger, Dennis Kahn's eventual father dies when Genghis Khan is eight years old. When the father dies, the tribe abandons the mother and her young children, so they're forced to fend for themselves. Eventually, the mother finds a way to find a supporting tribe, and Genghis Khan slowly finds mentors for protection. He eventually finds a mentor who becomes his best friend. And his best friend's name is Jomoka. And the two together are great warriors, and they conquer a lot of territory together. In fact, when Genghis Khan's wife is stolen by a tribe, the two will race off and get the wife back. But by this time, Genghis Khan's wife is pregnant with another man's son. Genghis Khan raised the son as his own, and he made the son here to his empire, which will cause great difficulties when Genghis Khan dies, okay? But that just shows you the generosity of this man. Eventually, Genghis Khan will run into conflict with Jamal Khak. And the two are competing for control of the Mongol world. Genghis Khan kills him to achieve his dominance. And Genghis Khan will overflow the existing Mongolian social order. Basically, all these top chieftains, all these top shamans, he will kill in order to unite the Mongol people and bring about a new social order. So that's the story that we have from the secret history. And that's very similar, by the way, to other founding of other people. Like for example, let's look at Rome, okay? So, remember last semester we discussed Virgil's Inaab, okay? And it's about the founder of Rome, his name is Inius. Inius is a prince of Troy, and he has to watch the destruction of Troy. He escapes the sacking of Troy, where everyone is killed, but he gets lost at sea, okay? Eventually, he stumbles under Carthage, where he falls in love with a queen there named Ditto. But the gods demand that he leaves Ditto, the woman that he loves and he's married, and he does, he betrays Ditto, who then kills herself. Then he goes to Italy, where he has to fight a war in order to establish the children people on Italy, and they will eventually give rise to the Roman people. Okay, so it's a very similar structure, the story of Genghis Khan. Let's go to another story from Rome. So the founder of Rome is named Romulus, who was directed as Senate of Ineos. So there's a king called Numitor, and his brother, Amelius, usurps the throne. And once Amelius usurps the throne, he puts Numitor's daughter into a temple and makes her a virgin. But Mars, the war guard, Mars, visits her and then pregnancy her with twins. Numerator demands the twins be killed and the twins are left alone by the Tiber River and everyone thinks that they will drown. But their marxies safe and a she-wolf nurses them and a shepherd adopts them. Eventually they discover the true heritage and they help their grandfather Numerator kill his brother, Amelis, and restore the throne. Then the two go off to find their own city, which is Rome. Okay? But they're going to be one king. So the two fight and Romulus kills his twin brother, Remus. All right? And then Romulus becomes Rome's first king, which will eventually give rise to the greatest empire in the European world. All right? So as you can see, the structures are very similar. So let's go over very quickly the structure and meaning of proto-Indo-European myth. The thing I want to remember is that what mythology ultimately is, it's a collective subconscious of a culture. Okay, by understanding mythology, we can understand the fundamental values that underpin this culture. So what is the structure we're looking at? Okay, the structure is this. First, the gods favor a man with a divine mission. But the man himself does not understand this divine mission. The gods have picked this man for whatever reason, and this man must fulfill his divine mission. And in the process, he will suffer hardship to become as hard as a sword. Hardship makes you commit. It makes you strong. And to recognize his mission. In the process, he's asking himself, why am I being persecuted? Why am I serving so much? And then eventually he will have an epithany. He will recognize, oh, it's because the gods have a mission for me that I must fulfill. That's why I'm suffering. That's why I'm being persecuted. It's to make me strong and committed. And he will sacrifice his beloved to prove his commitment to his divine mission. This is really important. In proto-Indo-European myth, the hero must always sacrifice his beloved. So remember the story of Genghis Khan. He sacrifices, he kills his best friend, Jomoka. And you think, okay, what's the big deal? Well, in that culture, when two wars are best friends, they're not just friends, okay? They're basically lovers. They have sex with each other, and that's why they're such great warriors together. It's a very common thing. So remember the Iliad, where in the Iliad, Hector kills Patroclus, And Achilles becomes soaring rage that he goes and kills Hector. So why did Achilles become soaring rage? Because Petroclis was his best friend, which at that time everyone understood to mean Petroclis and Achilles were lovers. Achilles loved Petroclis. So when Genghis Khan killed Jomaka, He was basically killing the man he loved the most in this world. That's a very important part of proto-enduring European myth. You have to show your commitment by making the ultimate sacrifice, which means killing the person you love the most. And once he does that, he will shatter the old world to build a new one. That is a divine mission. The gods do not like this world. They want a flood to destroy this world in order for the world to be made a new and this man, the Messiah, he is the one who will shatter the old world. He's the world shatterer. Okay? He's the flood sent by the gods. All right? So that's a basic structure of proto-Indo-European myth. And when we understand this, now what we can do is understand the power of the Jesus story within Christianity. Why is Christianity the most influential and popular religion in the world? It has to do with the story of Jesus. And the story of Jesus, according to the Gospel of Mark, let's look at the structure. It's very similar to the Porto Indo-European mythology. Jesus has a secret divine mission. He's sent by God, or he is God, who's come to redeem the world. He must suffer persecution and doubt. So everyone doubts who he is. No one knows who he is. He's laughed at. He's mocked. He then is sacrificed to wake the world. He kills himself or he is sacrificed so that everyone knows how much God loves them. And with God's sacrifice, this cycle of violence ends and a new history begins. So in proto-Indo-European myth, what's important is that you kill your beloved. But the founding myth of Christianity is, no, I kill myself to show you that violence is terrible. Once God has killed himself, Once God has sacrificed himself, it means that all violence now must cease. The cycle of violence, the cycle of using violence to redeem the world, to cleanse the world must come to an end. Okay? And that's the very idea, foundational idea of Christianity. And so what Christianity is doing that's very clever is, it's seeking to collect the subconscious that's embedded in every individual. And then planning a new idea within the subconscious that grows and grows. Okay, it's almost like a virus until people recognize that violence is bad. Proto-Indo-European mythology celebrates violence, right? Christianity, police violence is the worst thing, okay? So, so, so let's, sorry, this is a bit, okay. All right, anyway, I'll just read it to you, okay? So this is the ending of Mark, okay? Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last, okay? So he's been sacrificed. He's died. And the curtain of the temple was torn into from top to bottom. The temple is the second temple in Jerusalem, where Yahweh is. And at the very top of this temple is a room called the Holy of the Holies. That's where God lives. And the curtain is what hides God from the world, okay? So when Jesus died, the curtain now is 20 and a half. Meaning God is now released into the world, which means that everyone now has access to God. God is now on earth. Okay? Now when the centurion, the soldier, who stood facing him saw that in this way, he breathed his last. He said, truly, this man was God's son. So the first person that Jesus revealed himself to was a Roman soldier. The first person that recognized the truth of Jesus and the power of sacrifice was a Roman soldier who's always been taught that violence is the answer to everything. And once he's converted, he recognizes that violence is wrong and evil. So that's the power of this mythology. Does that make sense for you guys? All right, so now I want to look at real history, okay, because this is mythology. And what I want to do now is show you that Genghis Khan fits into a pattern of a great conqueror. If you look at all the great conquerors of human history, and I'll list four right now, okay? Sgt. Akid, Philip of Massinon, Julius Caesar, and Genghis Khan, you will see they are very, very similar. Okay? So let's get Sgt. Akad. Remember before, in Mesopotamia, it was divided into the Sumerian city states that warred with each other. And these were walled cities because these were walled cities. They couldn't really conquer each other. Sarkonov Akked figured out a way to conquer everyone and build the first empire in war history called the Akkadian Empire. So we don't know much about him, but this is what we know. First of all, he was probably a mercenary. It's very common back then to be a mercenary because these city-states were at war with each other always. He was a cup bearer to the king or Zaba of Qish. Qish is one of these city-states in Samaria. Now, guys, cup bearer is a very important position. A cup bearer means that when you're at the king and you have a feast or a festival for your people, the cup bearer is the man who stands beside you and pours you the alcohol, the wine, right? Which means this is the man you trust the most. So what's it mean for Sargon Akkad to be a cup bearer? Well, it probably means that there were lovers. The king and Sargon were lovers who loved each other deeply. But that doesn't prevent Sargon from killing the king and taking the throne, which starts this massive war in the city states in which Sargon will eventually triumph. Well, so the thing about Sargon is he is really good at winning the favor of mentors, right? And ultimately he will betray mentors in order to achieve his ambition. Well that's also true for Philip of Macedon. So Philip of Macedon, he's a prince of Macedon. And at this time in the Greek world, Thebes was the dominant military power. Thebes defeated Macedon in a battle and Thebes demanded hostages. So Philip was sent as a hostage to Thebes, where he is now mentored by the greatest military strategist of this time named Ipim, my notice, okay? And so Philip II is learning how to win battles. He's learning all the major military innovations of this time from the greatest general of this time. And then what he will do is he will return to Macedon, reorganize the Macedon army and then take them to conquer Thebes, as well as the entire Greek world at the Battle of Shorinia. OK? Well, this pattern is also true for Julius Caesar. At this time, which is about, like, 50 BCE in Rome, Pompey the Great is the greatest general. He's the man that everyone admires. He has the most local power. So what Julius Caesar does is he marries his daughter to Pompey the Great, And this forms a political alliance between the two. Pompey the Great grants him a generalship of the province of Gaul, where Julius Caesar will win military glory. It basically establishes the power, prestige, and fame of Julius Caesar. And this will start a civil war in which Julius Caesar will defeat his mentor Pompey at the Battle of Farselas. Versus the pattern. Well, the same is also true for Genghis Khan. He is mentored by two chieftains, Jamaica and Togo, and he will defeat both in order to gain leadership of the Mongol world. So it shows you how ruthless and ambitious these great congress are. But at the same time, let's remember this. Philip II had a really talented subordinate in Parmenion. Parmenion was really the person in charge of the Macedonian army. In fact, it was Parmenion who was most responsible for Axiom and the Great's conquest of Persia. Okay? Julius Caesar had a talent subordinate in Titus Labinius, who was responsible for his victories in Gaul. And then Genghis Khan had a talent subordinate in Supertae, who was considered one of the greatest military strategists ever. Okay? And so what this tells us is, They're able to exercise tremendous judgment in people. They know who to trust, they know who not to trust. They know who is talented and who is not talented. They know how to win the loyalty of their subordinates. Okay, that's a very impressive skill. And then the question then is, how is it possible that they are rooflessly ambitious at the same time they're able to delegate power in a very effective manner? And the answer is they all believe they have a divine mission. Their goal is not to conquer the world. Their goal is to change the world for the better, as demanded by the gods. Does that make sense? That's the only way we can understand this. Each in their own way believe they are the Messiah, sent by the gods to shadow the world so that it can be built anew. And that's what drives them to kill their beloved. And that's what drives them to do what they do. All four, ultimately, they are able to conquer the world because they develop a professional meritocratic and innovative army. What does professional mean? It means that, look at Sargon the Great, a Sargon of Akit. At this time, there were no professional soldiers. Most people were farmers and you only fought off season. You might fight two, three months of the year. Sarkarov-Adkhead was the first to say, nope, we will have professional soldiers. Everyone else will pay taxes in order for me to pay my professional army, but these are professional soldiers. They are full-time soldiers at war. Meretocratic means the system before was, The nobility always had a priority. The nobility was always right. And Sergeant of Akkid made the system more open and fair and democratic. So if you were talented and you were brave, you could rise within the ranks of the army regardless of your heritage and your background. Innovative means they were always adapting and learning. So Sergeant Akkid was able to conquer the Submarine city states, which, again, were walled by adopting siege warfare, which was unheard of before. And the same is true for Philip, Julius Caesar, and Genghis Khan. So again, Genghis Khan fits into a pattern here of what these great congress look like. Does this make sense to you guys? Any questions so far? All right, let's continue. So now I want to discuss why the Mongols did what they did. Why did the Mongols commit so many atrocities? What was the logic or reasoning behind their brutality? In order for me to do so, I'm going to introduce to you today a new analytical model called game theory. The idea of game theory is this. All human interaction can be perceived as a game in which at least two people are playing and they're trying to defeat each other. So for example, let's just say these two guys are fighting each other. They want to kill each other. Now, according to game theory, each person has a distinctive optimal strategy. It's called optimal strategy. Optimal strategy is given the constraints of your circumstance, what is the best way for you to win? Okay, so if you're the big guy, okay, this is the big guy, he wants the game to be fair, which is like, let's just arrange to fight at a certain time and we'll fight, okay? And he wants to use this strategy because he is most likely to win. But if you're this guy, a small guy, right, let's call him A, and you're fighting B, you don't want to do that because you're bound to lose. So what you do is you figure out a time when B is most vulnerable. Maybe when he's asleep or he's eating and you attack him then, okay? You basically have to cheat in order to win. So each individual has a distinctive optimal strategy. Now, this sounds easy, but it's not because often there are multiple players in the game. Okay, so you have C and you have D. And when you have multiple players in the game, you have to think about alliances and coordination, okay? So it's possible that A and D will form an alliance to attack B, which will force B and C to form an alliance, okay? But once maybe C and B kill off D, then A and C will form an alliance to kill off B, okay? So what this tells us is not only does each person have an optimal strategy given the constraints of the game, but this optimal strategy will change according to the circumstances. All right. Also, what's important first remember is that there are always these external constraints. External constraints might be just weather or weapons or whatever, okay. Okay, so game theory sounds easy, but it's extremely complicated because you always have to switch perspective in order to better understand why this person is doing what he or she is doing. Okay, does that make sense? All right, so let's look at game theory and apply it to the Mongols. Okay, remember, the Mongols are a borderland people and they're fighting empires. And remember, if you're a borderland, okay, borderland empire, You have three distinct advantages. You have energy, you're open, and you're opportunistic. These are the three advantages that you have as a borderland people like the Mongols. As an empire, your three advantages are mass. You have a lot of people. You have organization. You have depth. So it seems, so again, given the strengths, It is not that easy to determine who will win. But we're trying to figure out the mentality of the mongols. We know the mongols have these three strings, and they're trying to defeat the empire, which has these three strings. At the same time, we have to remember the mongols themselves have three fundamental weaknesses that they must compensate for if they are to win. So let's go over their major constraints. The first constraint that they have is extremely low population. There are not that many of them. In fact, they're often our number, often 100 to one. And so that's a major constraint. When Genghis Khan was alive, at his height, he had anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 troops. The second constraint is the idea of distance and geography. What I mean by that is the Mongols have to fight over huge territory Because Central Asia is a huge land, right? And this is problematic because of supply issues, supplies. What this means is if you're the Mongols, the thing that you cannot ever fight is a war of attrition. A war of attrition just means a long war in which you're trying to deplete the other person's resources. If you're the Mongols, the worst thing that can ever happen to you is if you're stuck in a war of attrition. If the siege is too long, the war lasts for too long. Because eventually you'll run out of soldiers. So that's what the Mongols fear the most. So distance. The last thing that's really important is governance. Governance just means the Mongols are nomadic people who do not know how to govern other people. So they don't make stuck in a situation where they're forced to govern other people. Does that make sense? And what this means is the idea of whole territory. When you conquer a new land, what you usually do is you put in place a new regime. They can't do that because they don't have the personnel for that. They often don't even have the personnel for siege warfare. But what they will do is recruit Chinese engineers, Indian engineers, in order to implement siege warfare. But bureaucrats are very hard to compensate for. So these are three fundamental weaknesses of the Mongol system. Low population, they have to fight long distances, and therefore they have to worry about supplies, and they don't know how to govern other people. And if we do this, if we look at what the strengths are, and we look at what their fundamental constraints are, then we can figure out what their optimal strategy is. So this is the optimal strategy for the Mongols. The first is escalation dominance. Escalation dominance is this. There's a concept in both local science called escalation ladder. The escalation ladder, I mean, it's a very simple concept. It means violence always escalates. So for example, I get into an argument with someone. Well, what first happens is we start to argue, but then eventually this argument becomes much more heated and we start to push each other. Then I might throw a punch, if I was to punch back, then I might bite him, he might bite me back, I might pull out a knife, he might pull out a gun. This is called escalation ladder. Violence has to happen over time. Okay? And this is fine, this is fine, Now the problem is what if you're fighting multiple people at once, right? So what you want to do is show other people that you are more dominant, okay? So if you insult me, I'll put a gun on you and I'll shoot you, okay? That's the idea of escalation dominance. I always have the capacity to inflict more damage on you than you could ever possibly inflict on me, okay? And that's why the Mongols did what they did. So what will often happen is the Mongols would send a trade delegation to a nation to negotiate a trade deal. And the nation, usually in Central Asia, they would kill all the delegation in order to insult Genghis Khan. In response, Genghis Khan would send his army to destroy the entire city, burn them city and kill everyone, okay? This is the idea of escalation dominance. You have to prove escalation dominance if you are to be a viable threat to everyone, okay? So that's the first idea, escalation dominance. Second idea is the idea of terror, or what we call psychological warfare. If you are badly outnumbered in warfare, then you have to make people afraid to fight you, okay? If you cannot govern people, if you don't know how to properly manage people, you have to make people afraid to rebel. So the Mongols were notorious for Cyclops of Warfare. So for example, what they would do is this. They would conquer some territory and to ensure the villagers would not ever rebel, they would send one Mongol soldier into the village. And this is one soldier and there might be a thousand villagers. And then what this Mongol soldier will do is randomly kill some villagers. He'll say, hey, you guys come over here, line up, and he starts killing people randomly. And if the villagers ever rebel and kill him, then the Mongols will come and kill everyone in the village. So that's the idea of psychological warfare. But the Mongols do this to themselves as well. So the Mongols have a system where units are divided into units of 10. So 10 soldiers, and then these 10 soldiers times 10 will make up a unit. So what would happen is this. If ever in a battle, one soldier ran away from battle, all of the people in these units would be executed. But if one unit ever ran away, then the next unit, 100 of them, would all be executed. So this gives everyone incentive to make sure your fellow soldier does not run away. So the Mongols had psychological warfare not just for other people, but also for themselves. Not just the way the Mongols fought. And they had to fight like this, given the fact they were greatly outnumbered. and they had to win quickly against their enemies. All right? Does that make sense? Okay? And the last thing, which is the most important, is they had to create an aura of inevitability and invincibility. At this time, people were literally telling people, these Mongols are not human. They are demons. They have come from Tartarus, and that's where we get the name Tartarus. They have come from Tartarus. hell in order to kill everyone. These are demons. Guess what, guys? The Mongols wanted this reputation. They definitely could in order to promote this reputation, because it gave them an aura of inevitability and invincibility. They could not be defeated. There's no point in trying to defeat them. So let's just give up. And most did. Most said, the Mongols were able to conquer so much territory so fast because they that is aura of inevitability and invincibility and most people just gave up, they just pay tribute. If you didn't do so, then they would use escalation dominance and terror to kill everyone. And they would send refugees all around the world so everyone would know about the ferocity and brutality of the Mongols. Does that make sense, guys? So in other words, I had to say this, But according to game theory, everything the Mongols did made complete sense. In fact, it's their optimal strategy. Given the circumstances, given the constraints, what they did was completely logical and reasonable, even though it resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people. Does that make sense? All right. Okay, so now let's discuss why their empire collapsed. All right, so there's a fundamental weakness in the entire Mongol-Latino strategy approach. It's a great strategy if you are trying to conquer the people, when you're trying to govern them, okay, it's an issue. All right, so as we discussed, the Mongols are great warriors like all-step people because of their cultural values. This is a culture that emphasizes three things. First is freedom. Second is egalitarianism. And third is self-reliance. So rather than think of the Mongol the army as a empire or organization, it's more like a confederation. People choose to join this confederation because of the immense rewards that can be achieved for conquest, okay? So this is a culture that values freedom, egalitarianism, and self-reliance, and therefore it makes great warriors. The problem though is that cultures they conquer were extremely, extreme hierarchies, all right? Where you have maybe the emperor at the top, a bureaucracy, and then peasantry at the very bottom. So the vast majority were peasants. Now, I know this is hard for us to understand, but the reason why the Mongols were able to conquer these empires were almost a contempt for these empires. Does that make sense, guys? The Mongols had absolutely no respect for these empires. They thought they were weak, They thought they were corrupt and decadent. So the Mongols were able to conquer them. Does that make sense? There's a contempt for them. The contempt is this. The underlying, the optimal strategy of the Mongols is a concept that never existed in human history before. And the concept is this. People are an infinite resource. So for most of the human history, people were the most valuable resource. There was not many people around. Therefore, you had to treat people nicely if you wanted to maximize their productivity. But where were the Mongols based? They were based in East Asia. They were based in China, basically. And in China, because of the empire, people were treated like an infinite resource. You could massacre them. You could send them off in human wave attacks. It didn't matter because they were an infinite resource. And this idea never existed before in human history. And in the Western world, this concept is radically revolutionary. It was unimaginable, like you could do this. So remember Julius Caesar, even though he, when he conquered Rome, he wasn't intent on massacring people. Why? Because people could be sold as slaves. That was the main way he made his fortune, by selling the gulls as slaves. But if you believe that people are an infinite resource, then you don't want them as slaves. You want to kill as many people as possible in order to inflict terror. So that's the issue with the Mongols. First of all, their value system not lend itself to governing a hierarchy. They didn't know how to and they didn't want to. Also, much more problematic was their contempt for the local culture. If you have contempt for local culture, you're going to have problems managing the people. So in China, during the Yuan Dynasty, the Chinese, there's a class system. The Mongols were at the top, and the Chinese were at the very bottom. The foreigners were sort of in between. And that just shows you the Mongol contempt for Chinese people. And that's why ultimately the Chinese people rebelled against the Mongols. Now eventually, the Mongol leadership would recognize this problem. And they would try to adopt a Chinese-style bureaucracy. But a bureaucracy, and we discussed this, comes in contact with the nobility. Nobility. The nobility is intent on maintaining the Mongolian culture. They did not want to assimilate. But the emperor recognized you had to assimilate if you are to have this empire. And because they couldn't agree, the nobility and the emperor couldn't agree, ultimately it led to the collapse of the Mongol Empire. So that's the history of the Mongols. Any comments? Any questions? I know what Doug is. I don't have any questions yet. But do you want to make a comment? Because I know you've studied the Mongols quite in detail. I'm kind of scared. This is on YouTube. OK, all right. Yeah, all right. So yeah, it's fine. OK, any questions, guys? Like, I know there's a lot to take in. So ask questions. Tell me where areas you are confused by. OK? Yep? Yeah? It's all about you. Yeah? The Longland University of Washington. Yeah, yeah. That's the fun way. Yeah, that's a great question, okay? That's a great question. Vikings versus Mongols, okay? Okay, all right, so, the Vikings and the Mongols all come from the proto-Indo-European culture. What we know about culture is that it's very fluid and it will change over time and it will adapt itself to the local cultures, okay? And so, the Vikings were in Europe And the Mongols are near China. And I have to say, I think if I wanted to be a Viking or a Mongol, I prefer to be a Viking. And the reason why is the Vikings never really adopted a belief that people were an infinite resource. They couldn't because Europe was very poor. And the Vikings, regardless, even though they were brutal, they started to respect for their opponents. They never developed a contempt for their opponents. They were surrounded by the Byzantines, the Muslims, and the Europeans. And these were great warriors. So the Vikings felt they had a lot to learn from these cultures. And in fact, ultimately, the Vikings will assimilate themselves into these cultures in different environments. So the Mongols are different, though. The Mongols are based in East Asia. And they did ultimately adopt a belief that people are an infinite resource. And they had tremendous contempt for Chinese culture. And that changes you as a person. When you believe that people are infinite resource and you are contemptuous of other cultures, It also, in a way, makes you contemptors of yourself. If that makes any sense. And so ultimately, that's why the Mongols were not able to, even though they had tremendous wealth, they didn't really produce cultural monuments. We don't have, like the Vikings, as I mentioned, the Vikings were fundamental development of Western civilization. The Mongols were not fundamental development of any civilization. I mean, they caused a havoc and they were great conquerors, but they didn't leave a rich cultural legacy. So, and I think it has to do with the belief that people are an infinite resource, okay? So, I would much prefer to be a Viking. I would much prefer to be enslaved by a Viking than a Mongol. Like, if I were a slave, I would much rather be a slave to a Viking than a Mongol, okay? If I were a slave to a Viking, the Vikings would at least become my friend. They'd be like, hey, tell me about your culture or any stories that you can tell us. Okay, and if you were a great storyteller, then they would make you, they would treat you very, very nicely because you're helping them learn more about your culture. Okay, then almost out of that, I'd say no interest in other cultures. They were interested in conquering and exploiting other people. All right, I could be wrong. All right, and I'm probably making these rationalizations, but I believe with the Vikings, there's a general curiosity about the world that comes from a general respect of other cultures. Whereas the Mongols were not curious about the world, they were intent on conquest and enslaving other people and exploiting other people. They were predators. And again, that could be my prejudice, but based on my readings so far, that would be my belief. But please change my mind. Okay, all right, thanks for the question. Okay, great question, and any other questions? Or, sorry, so population, okay? So the Mongol population is loosely defined, okay? Do you understand? It's hard to say who's Mongol and who's not Mongol because that entire area has a similar culture and it's very hard to figure out where the borders are, okay? Like, yeah. Okay, great question, okay, yeah. So you're right. So the Mongols are a low population. So why would they believe that people are infinite resource? And the answer is because they are always in contact with China. So the Mongols were always in contact with China. And as I mentioned, the interaction happens in three ways. The Mongols are working as either mercenaries for dynasties in China, or they are trading, or their raiding and pillaging. So for centuries, there's been contact between China and the Mongols. So where did the Mongols learn the idea that people are infinite resource? Well, they learned it from China. And why did it learn from China? Because Chinese warfare was also predicated on the belief that people were infinite resource. Does that make sense? So basically the entire idea of warfare in China is I organized this person's army, I fought on my opponent. And then if my entire army dies, guess what? I'll just go and I'll raise another present army and throw it at my opponent again. It's like human wave attacks. We call this human wave attacks. This was pioneering in China, and the Mongols just took it and used it everywhere else. So if you're the Mongols and you're fighting this enemy and they're just throwing these peasants at you, and you're killing them all, but no one cares, because then, like a month later, another present army comes at you. You quickly adopt the idea that people or an infinite resource, right? Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. And so, if you absorb different topics, so I'm not gonna. That's right, yeah. That's right, yeah, the Mongols were a very open society. Like, if you had a benefit to the society, and so for example, if you were a Chinese teacher, or a Chinese scholar, or a Chinese engineer, or a Chinese merchant, they would quickly assimilate you, okay? And then they would kill everyone else. Okay, so they were a pretty open society. Okay, so does that make sense? Okay, great. Any more questions? Yes? Okay, great, okay. All right, so let's talk about mythology. All right, so again, if you're actually studying mythology, what you recognize is there's a structure that's very similar across many different cultures, right? So if you look at Greek, if you look at Roman, Norse, Mongolian. Okay, I can go on and on and on. There is a very similar structure, even though the characters might be different. But it's a mythology that celebrates violence and individualism as a way to remake the world. It's a way to strengthen individualism violence. So why is that the case? It's about culture, cultural values. So as I discussed in this class, cultural values are the most persistent part of who you are. Why? Because it's part of your subconscious. There's a conscious you, and there's a subconscious. And ultimately, you are your subconscious. And subconscious is composed of your cultural values. This is the essence of who you are. So even though the Polo Indo-Europeans, they were going into different environments, and they were assimilating themselves into different environments. And they look physically different. Culturally, subconsciously, they shared a similar value system. And this value system will then go on to inform the way they perceive the world, their worldview. And this worldview will then benefits itself through mythology, which will eventually become literature. Does that make sense? So they might have changed clothes. They might have changed their hair color, but their soul was still proto-Indo-European. And the same is also true for language. And that's why so many words repeat themselves in different languages. Does that make sense? Great. Any more questions? OK, great. So next class, we will go back to Europe. We will do the Crusades, which will then take us to the Renaissance and the Reformation and the silent revolution."}

Today we do Sigmund Freud. First what I will do is I will put Freud in the context of the Western religious intellectual and literary tradition. All right, so in the beginning, the main religion for us humans during the Ice Age was animism, okay? And the idea of animism is that we humans are no different from every other living conscious being in the world. We are like the trees, we are like the animals, we're all interconnected together. And life is just a cycle of life and death, birth and rebirth. All right? And this is, this religion is still around today in many primitive societies. for example, in the Amazon. And then we transitioned to the mother goddess. So as we became more agricultural, fertility was more and more important. We needed to have more children and we needed to grow more crops. And so we began to worship the mother goddess and women were very high status at this stage in history. But as populations grew and towns came to being, They came into competition with each other. They started to war against each other. This created polytheism. Polytheism is the idea that each place has its own God that's its patron. And when these places come into conflict and war, the way they settle disputes is the losing party, their God becomes their servant to the winning God. And this creates the idea of the pantheon that we see in Greek, Roman mythologies, as well as Norse mythologies. Now, the radical break from this tradition was the birth of monotheism. Now, there's going to be a lot of scholarly debate about which was the first monotheistic religion. Some say there are certain Egyptian cults that were monotheistic. Some say the Jews were. Some say the Zoroastrians were. In this class, what you learn is actually it was the Christians who were the first true monotheistic religion. And the reason why is the Christians introduce the idea of the Holy Trinity. All right, okay? And remember what the Holy Trinity is. The Holy Trinity, the idea is God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, these are different entities, but they are co-equal to each other. They are separate, but unified. They are different, but equal. And this idea, it's very hard for us to logically reconcile. The only way for us to understand this is if God is both nothing and everything. Therefore it excludes everything. There can be no other God with our God. Okay, and this is the idea of monotheism. And the power of monotheism is that for the first time in human history, It creates the idea of the individual. Because when God has everything, you have a direct connection with God. And it removes you from the community. Okay? Now, this will create a lot of problems in the future. But at this point in history, remember, monotheism is being promoted by the Roman Empire as a way to consolidate its rule over its vast territory. At this stage in history, this is not a problem. And the reason why is mediating you and God is the Catholic Church. But not only that, the Catholic Church mediates God for everyone. So in this way, the Church creates its own community. So at this stage in history, this is not a problem. But remember, the Church becomes corrupt And there are many religious reformers who believe that you don't really need the church in order to access God. In fact, you have a moral imperative to access God directly through the Bible. You have to read the Bible by yourself and you have to interpret it properly. Okay? And so obviously the most similar reform is Martin Luther. Now this is important because what will happen is by living in the church, You create direct access to God, and this creates the idea of crisis in faith. The idea of crisis in faith is, how do you truly know as a person whether or not you love God, and how do you know God loves you? Think about your mother, right? You know your mother loves you, and you know you love your mother, But there are many days when you really hate your mother and you fight with your mother. Okay, so it's hard for us not to doubt ourselves. And so this creates the question of faith because in Protestantism, you are required to show absolute faith and devotion in God. If you doubt, if you hesitate, you will be condemned to hell. All right, so this creates the idea of crisis and faith. Historically, there have been many solutions to this problem. Different profits are proposed different solutions. So let's look at three different solutions. So the first solution is the idea of wealth accumulation. So these are the Calvinists, right? They argue that to show your true faith in God and for you to prove to yourself, God truly loves you, you make a lot of money. That is a testament to the power of your faith, wealth accumulation. So that's one solution. It's a very popular solution. It's what gives us capitalism today. The second solution is that if G had, you will die for your faith. You'll sacrifice yourself to promote the truth of God. That's also a solution. Then there's one more solution that we will discuss today. It's hard for us to understand. So I'm going to take some time to explain it fully, okay? This is the idea of transgression. So let me explain it to you slowly. The idea is this. You must demonstrate complete and absolute faith in God to be one of the elect, to go to heaven. To do so, you must demonstrate courage. You must demonstrate financialism. The best way to do that is to prove yourself to God by rejecting the laws of man, by rejecting human morality, by rejecting social taboos, by breaking social taboos, as you demonstrate your faith in God. All right, now I know this sounds like a strange idea, but let me give you an example to show you what this means. Let's just say that in school, I decided to start a new class. And this new class is called Individual Empowerment. And my very first assignment to all my students is I want you guys to go shoplift. I want you guys to go steal a piece of candy from a small store. And of course, you are disgusted and you are pulled by this suggestion. What if you get caught? Well, you might get expelled from school. You might be jailed. Your parents may punish you. You may be outcast from society. And then I tell you, have faith. Trust me. When you do this and you break the social taboo that's preventing you from realizing your full potential, you will feel an extreme sense of exhalation, liberation, excitement. And this will motivate you to do greater things in life by breaking taboos, by transgression against society and showing your true faith in God, you will master your destiny, okay? And so you guys go and you go steal something from the store, you get a little bit, and guess what? You feel excited, you feel exhilarated, you feel energized. Okay, and that's the idea of transgression. And this has always been a very, and this has been around for us for like hundreds of years as well, okay? So these are the three main ways that historically the religious practitioners have tried to resolve the issue of the crisis of the faith, right? Welfare accumulation, that's a Calvinist, jihad, and you also have transgression. Remember transgression, it's very important for discussion. So remember this idea. Now another way to resolve the question of faith is through philosophy, epistemology. Epistemology. Epistemology really just means the theory of knowledge. How do ideas come together? What does knowledge come from? How do we know what we know? Because the question of faith is essentially How do we know? So, epistemology is really philosophy's attempt to resolve this question of faith. Remember before we discussed Kant. And Kant proposed the idea of active subjectivity. Active subjectivity is the idea that we are not just passive consumers of information. We actively participate in reality. We imagine reality in a way that allows us to understand it. What Kant tells us is we imagine space and time onto reality, which creates a word of appearance for us to understand. The problem with Kant is what is reality? And Kant doesn't know. In fact, he tells us it is impossible to truly understand reality. And this goes to problem because if that's the case, then how do we know if reality exists or not? It's entirely possible that we are in a computer simulation. So Hegel comes along and resolves this issue by introducing the idea of the Geist. The Geist, the spirit, the mind. He argues that this is the manifestation of God that is the underlying basis of all reality. And from this reality comes material world. What will then happen is that Marx will come along and he will argue that Geist is really history. Hegel believes that the Geist is in a process of reconciling itself with the world. It's becoming the world and it's bringing us along with it so that one day everyone will achieve full enlightenment. Marx inverts Hegel and puts the material world before the world of ideas. And he argues that history, it is a movement of class struggle. And the end of history is when all class struggle ceases and we all become equal in a worker's paradise. Why? Because as capitalism becomes worse and worse, As the polyterid increase in number, but are exploited and greater, but are oppressed by the capitalist, eventually the polyterid, you and me, will develop class consciousness. And we will unite, we will overflow the capitalist class through collective action. Okay? So this is Marx. Now, today we will study Freud. Because what will happen is Freud will come along and he will present a completely different conception of the movement of history and of the individual. He argues that the individual is really just unconscious forces embedded within the brain. Okay, so these three forces are the superego, the ego and the id. The ego is who we think we are. The superego are these social forces that act upon us. And the id are these hidden sexual urges. And what he will argue is actually these hidden sexual urges are the two foundations of who we are, as well as office civilization. And he names two of them. The first is what is called the edipal, the edipal complex. The second is electro complex. So remember that Ida Puzz is a character from Greek mythology, a king who killed his father and married his mother. Electra is also a character from Greek mythology, a woman who wanted to kill her mother and marry his father, okay? Lecture is from the Ischulist play, the Aristia. Freud was remarkably well read in good mythology as well as well literature. So he argues these are the two fundamental basis of who we are. If you are a man, you are the evil complex. If you are a woman, you are the, you have the lecture complex, okay? Now, this is all strange because cot makes sense, hegel makes sense, marks make sense, and they all seem to flow from each other, and then you have Freud, okay? So the question then is, where did he get this idea? Where's this from? How did he develop this idea? All right, so we'll look at this question in great detail today. All right, so everyone knew that Freud's theory of unconscious is problematic. And he had a very famous student, his best student, his hair parent, named Carl Jung. And Carl Jung really saw Freud as a father, and he worshipped Freud. And he wanted to improve on Freud's theory of the unconscious. And over time, what Carl Jung will do is he will systemize this idea. So for Carl Jung, we have the ego. And the ego is made up of two forces, the conscious force and the subconscious. The subconscious is also divided into the personal as well as the collective. Sorry, it's not subconscious. Unconscious. Unconscious. So the personal unconscious are just our memories or experiences. The collective unconscious is the collection of all societies, memories, and experiences. And they are captured and expressed whenever we engage in society, when we read the food, when we talk to people, when we watch movies, when we read books. the collective unconscious is embedded through society, you breathe it like you would breathe air, okay? So, sorry, Ewan also says that we have the animus and the anima. In other words, we, sorry, in other words, we are made up of two opposing forces, the male and the female. There's a duality to us. So when we meet people, the ego projects a persona. The personas is basically our best self in a certain social context. So in school, you're a student and you try to be the best student. At home, you're a daughter. At McDonald's, you're a friend. So you are different personas in different social contexts. Now, we try to project our best self, But we are made up of a lot of bad memories, bad thoughts. So the ego suppresses the worst aspects of us in a shadow form. So the shadows really the alter ego of the ego. And this, Yoon argues, is what is called the self. And what he tells us is life is a constant process of self-discovery. If you truly want to master yourself, you must discover who you are and that will take a lifetime of self-exploration guided by a psychotherapist. And this sounds much more logical, right? And it's become really the standard model for modern day psychology. Now, you would think that Freud would be happy that Carl Jung came up with this new idea on how to improve his theory. But Freud was infuriated that Jung would question his theory. In fact, Freud was notorious for being control freak. He excommunicated Jung, refused to have anything to do with him. In fact, everyone in the community around Freud now, this is themselves from Koryong, and there will be no reconciliation between the two ever. And that's why Koryong had to go and develop this theory. So, and it's strange because all Koryong is trying to do is improve Freud. So that gives us the second question. Why was Freud so afraid of criticism? Why was it so secretive? And then the third question that we will look at today is, why does this idea become so popular? In fact, the ideas of Freud and Coeulon will become the basis of a major cultural movement called modernism. And modernism is the cultural movement that we still live in today. Now, there are many different definitions of modernism, But for us, the easiest definition is cult of the self. We live in a world, in a society, in a culture that's obsessed with ourselves, with self-improvement, with self-empowerment, all right? So we will look at where this came from, okay? So the three questions we're looking at today is, first of all, we just forget this idea for the edible complex. Second is, why was Freud so secretive? And the third question is, what explains Freud's popularity? Why was he so influential, and why was his influence able to spread so quickly? And what I will show you today is Freud became so influential and so famous, not because his psychoanalysis system was designed to help his patients. Ultimately, his system was designed to protect the interests of powerful interests, powerful men. Okay, that's my argument to you today. Okay, so having made the general argument, what I'm gonna do now is look at the evidence to support the argument, okay? So again, this is a chart that summarizes the different perspectives of these four major thinkers, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Freud. Okay, so to summarize the main ideas, Freud believes that our sexual urges is what underpins our identity as well as civilization. It's because we cannot control our sexual urges that gives rise to religion, which helps us cope with our guilt. He also believes that truth lies and our suppressed memories. And in his framework, God has abandoned us. There's really no God in his system. We are left to fend for ourselves. We are left to deal with the trauma of being alone. All right, so let's put Freud in his historical context. So Freud lived and worked at the end of the 19th century primarily in Vienna. And at this time, Europe was going through fundamental social, cultural, economic, political change. We were transitioning from the pre-modern era to the modern era. Before, we lived primarily in towns and villages where we dealt with each other emotionally. And we had a purpose in our community. But when we moved to the cities, it is money and the clock that regulates our life. And it's still true today, right? So when you come to school, what controls your behavior? It's your grades, as well as the clock, right? If you are late for class, if you're absent, then your grades get deducted. So it's the same concept as we have today. All right. Now, because of these social changes, two new fields, sociology and psychology, are developed in order to try to understand what these changes mean for us as humans. So in the field of sociology, there are three major thinkers, pioneers of this time, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and this man, George Simmel. And George Simmel wrote a wonderful essay, called Metropolis and Mental Life, in which he describes what the impact of moving to the city has on people. Okay, so we'll just read a couple sentences. Instead of reacting emotionally, the metropolitan type reacts primarily in a rational manner, thus creating a mental predominance through the intensification of consciousness, which in turn is caused by it. Thus the reaction of the metropolitan person to those events is moved to a sphere of mental activity, which is least sensitive and which is further removed from the depths of the personality. Okay, so let's use a metaphor. Let's think of food. When you're in the village, you go your own food and then you make the food, you eat it, and that's it. You know exactly where the food comes from, you know how it's made, and you're not really curious about the food. But the one thing about the city is you get exposed to all different types of cuisine, all different types of flavors, and that excites your imagination. You're much more curious about it. You want to know where this food is made. The problem, though, of course, is this is all an abstraction. You have absolutely no idea where the food comes from. You have absolutely no idea where the food is made. And quite honestly, you don't even know if the food is healthy for you or not. So the city life is a higher abstraction. And of course, today, we're at the internet, which is even a higher abstraction. So you go from the village to the city, now to the internet. Of course, this creates a lot of problems for people because this transition causes psychological issues. And the three major psychological issues are, enemy, okay? And what this means is, before in the village, you know exactly what to do. But you move to the city, there are different rules, and it confuses you. For example, in the village, if someone punches you, you punch back. And then afterwards you become friends. In the city, if someone punches you and you punch back, you both go to jail. So it's confusing for people. Alienation means that you have actually no freedom in the city. You work from 9 to 5. You get up at 6 o'clock in the morning. Get up at 7 o'clock. Then get to work at 9 o'clock. Then you get to work at 5 and get home at 10 o'clock. So everything's the same regulated life. And you lack freedom. That might cause alienation. The last idea is disenchantment, where you feel as though you are just a machine and you have lost human agency. So this creates lots of psychological issues. And that's why at this time, psychologists become more popular. This is Simon Freud. And he was a very ambitious medical student who became a psychologist. And he started to see patients. And these patients were often young women who were historical. His history, historical is not a word we use anymore, but back then it just meant that they couldn't control their emotions. They were prone to outbursts, crying. When they saw a man, when they were touched by a man, they screamed, they cried. They couldn't form healthy relationships. Okay, so Freud was tasked with figuring out why this was happening and trying to help this woman. And he spent a lot of time with these women. And he did something pretty novel at the time, which is he basically, he just won their trust and asked them directly, why are you like this? And the woman, after many sessions, after becoming friends with Freud, they start to confide in Freud. And they told him the truth, which is, I'm hysterical, I'm afraid of men touching me because when I was young, my father abused me. And Freud, at first, was shocked. I think everyone would be shocked. But over time, he would hear this story from so many different patients with the same symptoms that he concluded that they must be telling him the truth. And he wrote a very famous paper in 1896 called The Atheology of Hysteria. Atheology means origins, okay? And in it he says, My previously communicated assumption that trauma, specifically sexual trauma, cannot be stressed enough as a pathogenic agent was confirmed anew. Even children of respected, high-minded, perennical families fall victim to real rape much more frequently than one had dared to suspect. Either the parents themselves take substitution for their lack of satisfaction in this pathological manner or else trusted persons as relatives, abuse, the ignorance and innocence of children. So he's arguing that abuse is much more common than we are led to believe. Even those that we think are pillars of society engage in the sort of abuse. So what he's doing is that he's becoming an advocate for this woman. He's telling the world, they're not crazy, they're not being historical. they were traumatized and that's why they're behaving like this. If you got hit by a car, your leg wouldn't, you wouldn't be able to walk. Well, these women are the same way. They were traumatized physically when they were young and that's why they are behaving like this. That's why they have problems forming these emotional bonds of others. The symptoms of hysteria are determined by certain experiences of the patients which have operated in a traumatic fashion and which are being reproduced in a psychological life in the form of and in medic symbols, okay? So what he's saying is this is not made up in the mind. This happened physically, and then it gets represented in the mind. So that's Freud arguing for his patients. Now let me introduce you to a man named Jeffrey Masson. And he wrote a book called The Assault on Truth. His story is this. He went to Harvard, and he became very interested in psychoanalysis. And he began to study it. And he became friends with Anna Freud, who is Sigmund Freud's daughter. Anna Freud thought very highly of him. And she trusted him with the letters of Sigmund Freud. And before, this was not open to the public. And no one knew all about these letters. But Jeffrey Mason spent years going over the letters. And what he discovered shocked him. The early Freud and the later Freud are two different people. They have two different theories about trauma and abuse. And in his book, he presents the evidence, which are Freud's letters to friends. So let's just read a couple. This is early Freud. I, therefore, put forward the thesis that at the bottom of every case of hysteria, there are one or more occurrences of premature experience, occurrences which belong to the earliest years of childhood. Okay? There are a whole number of other things that vouch for the reality of infantile sexual scenes. In the first place, there's the uniformity which exhibit in certain details. So what he's saying is, I know that people don't believe me, but the evidence is clear. I've talked to different people. They don't know each other. They're telling the same story. They're telling the same details. So either there's this giant conspiracy or they're telling the truth. It is less easy to refute the idea that the doctor forces reminiscences of this sort on the patient, that he influences him by suggesting to imagine and reproduce them. Nevertheless, it appears to me equally untenable. I've never yet succeeded in forcing on a patient a scene I was expecting to find in such a way that he seemed reliving through it with all the appropriate feelings. Perhaps others may be more successful in this. When you read Freud, you see him as a very clear, as a very nuanced, as a very balanced thinker. Okay, he accepts there are different possibilities. It's possible that he himself is suggesting false memories to his patients. And he says, this is possible, but I have failed to achieve this goal. And there are others who may be better at this than I, but I haven't been able to do it. Okay, so based on this evidence, He argues that these patients must be telling the truth. This is the early Freud. This is Sandor Forenzi, and for the longest time they were colleagues. They were best friends. They were both advocates for patients. Then they had falling out. They basically refused to talk to each other anymore. And the reason why is, central forensic continue to advocate for patient rights. Whereas, Semen Freud completely changed his attitude. So let's look at the new Freud. Since child masturbation is such a general occurrence, and is at the same time so poorly remembered, it must have an equivalent in psychic life. And in fact, it is found in the fantasy encounter in most female patients. Namely that, the father seduced her in childhood. This is the later reworking which is designed to cover up the recollection of infantile sexual activity and represents an excuse, an externiation, thereof. The grain of truth contained in this fantasy lies in the fact that the father, by way of his innocent caresses in earliest childhood, has actually awakened the little girl's sexuality. It is the same affectionate fathers that are the ones who then endeavored to break the child of the habit of masturbation. Okay, so what Freud is trying to say is, young girls from a very early age, they are sexual animals, they have these urges, and they have this longing for the father. And it's compounded by the fact that the father, in his innocence, hugs and caresses his little girl. It's made worse when the father notices that the girl is masturbating and tries to stop her. And this creates a sense of both resentment, hatred and more longing. Okay, so now what Freud is saying is, it's not the father, the father did nothing, he's innocent. The girl is the one who, because of these sexual urges, has all these sexual fantasies, that she is normally able to differentiate between fantasy and reality. All right, so this is from the essay, Fragments of Analysis of Hysteria. The love hungry little girl unhappy at having to share her parents' affection with her brothers and sisters realizes that all that tenderness comes flowing back when her parents are made anxious by her illness. The girl now knows what we are calling for her parents' love. So now he's explaining why hysteria is so common in society. And the answer is very simple. Women are desperate for attention. It's that simple. They're fine. They have no issues. They just want attention. And that's why they are hysterical, okay? Because they know that illness attracts attention from caregiving males. This is Simon Freud's book, Civilization and its Discontents. And in it, he expresses his contempt for women in society. All right, let's read it. Furthermore, women should soon come into opposition to civilization and display their retarding and restraining influence. Those very women who in the beginning laid the foundations of civilization like claims of their love. Women represent the interests of the family and of sexual life. Their work in civilization has become increasingly the business of men. It confronts them with ever more difficult tasks and compels them to carry out instinctual sublimations of which women are little capable. All right, so for saying this, we must thank women because about women, There'd be no civilization. They give birth. They raise families. But men are smarter than women. And so men are tasked with responsibility of building civilization, of creating science, of creating literature, of creating philosophy, of politics, of administration. But all we want is attention to be doled on. And that's why women hate civilization. First of all, because they're not smart and they can't really contribute to civilization, but also because it takes men away from them. Okay? So now the question then is, okay, this is like really strange because the Freud that we encountered earlier was a scientist, very clear, very nuanced, very subtle in his thinking. This Freud, he's like a myth maker. He's almost like a priest. Okay, so what explains the transition? Okay, well, there's a very simple explanation, right? Simple explanation, which is simple explanation is, he may be treating his patients who are young women, but who's paying the bills? The father, right? It's a father who's paying Freud. So if Freud went to the father and said, oh, I talked to your daughter, it's your fault that she's like this. Well, they wouldn't be very happy. So we can understand why at the end of the day, Freud decided that he needed to change his story if he wanted to maintain his clientele. So the question then is, OK, is there evidence to suggest that sexual trauma and abuse was common in Vienna at this time in history, the late 19th century? And the answer is yes. there is some piece of evidence, not complete, but there's some piece of evidence to suggest this was actually a thing in Vienna in the late 19th century. So Vienna is part of the Austrian-Hungary Empire, and there are lots of secret societies and religious cults at this time. One of them is called Fragonsum. And Fragonsum rejected Jewish norms and believed they were obligated to transgress moral boundaries. Okay, remember the question of faith, right? How do you demonstrate your faith in God? How do you know God loves you? How do you know you're faithful? Well, you break taboos. And they were bringing a lot of taboos. The Fregnance engaged in sexually promiscuous rights, such as the infamous 1756 incident where they were allegedly caught dancing around a half-naked woman. At its height, Fregnance claim perhaps 50,000 followers. That's a lot. 50,000 followers is a lot. And a lot of them were powerful people. permanently Jews living in the Polish Lutheran Commonwealth as well as Central and Eastern Europe. Later, Frank is working courage to convert in mass to Catholicism, okay? And so who are these people? Well, they are followers of a man named Sibatai Zephy who lived in 19th century, who was a Jewish rabbi who lived in 19th century Ottoman Empire. And for many, he was extremely charismatic And he was basically the Messiah. He was the Jewish Messiah. And he preached a religion of transgression because transgression meant courage. It meant empowerment. It meant true faith. And he had a lot of followers. And that's why the sultan called him and said, okay, I'll give you a choice. You can either continue doing what you do and I'll kill you or you convert to Islam. So he converted to Islam. But when he did so, he told his followers, I did so because God doesn't care about what you do. God cares about what's in your heart. As long as you're true to God, what you do in life does not matter. And the religion he started is still around today. And this is from Wikipedia, okay? All this is from Wikipedia And you can look at it online to make sure that I'm just making this up. So as part of this movement, I mean you can read this, right? All right? Sexual abuse was actually pretty common. So we have Evan suggest that yes, these women were probably telling the truth and for a new soul, but for it ultimately had to change the story in order to protect its livelihood. Okay, but there's also another reason why Freud had to change his story. And it has to do with what man named Ignis Simmelweis. Ignis Simmelweis lived in 1840s Vienna. And he was a doctor who worked at Vienna General Hospital. And he was in charge of two maternity clinics, places where women gave birth. Same hospital, same staff, but the maternity, but the mortality rate at the second clinic was much higher than the first clinic. Woman could die giving birth because of fever. So 10% of women were dying in the second clinic. And only about 3% were dying in the first clinic. So, in this case, he was appalled by this. And so he launched an investigation as to what was happening. And he spent seven months, a long, long time, trying to figure out what happened, what was happening. And he looked at all different possibilities. including weather, including treatment, including personnel, everything, okay? And then he had a radical break food, he had an insight, which is this, in the second clinic, it was a teaching hospital. So doctors, when in the morning, woke up cadavers, okay? They would show students how to dissect cadavers. And then in the afternoon, they'd go and deliver babies. And, likewise, he didn't know why because at this time germs were not a thing. that people didn't know about the existence of germs. He didn't know why, but he theorized that there could be connection. So he created a protocol. He basically had everyone wash their hands using a formula of water, chlorine, and lime. And we still use it today, exactly the same formula today. And so he tried this protocol. And it was a miracle. Because after people start to wash their hands, no one died in childbirth anymore. And, symbol-wise, being a rigorous scientist, he collected all this data to conduct a lot of experiments to prove this had to be true, that Washington hands could save lives. And then he presented his findings to the staff, the doctors of Vienna General Hospital, believing that they would praise him and then promote this all throughout Europe in order to save as many lives as possible. Instead, the doctors told him they had to keep this quiet. keep us quiet. They'll promote Sima Wise, they respect him, and he did amazing work, but if word came out that this was true, then people would know that they were responsible for the deaths of these women before, and their reputation would be in tatters. And then Sima Wise, of course, responded by, yes, I understand that, but if we don't publish her findings, if we don't let the world know about this, more women are going died in childbirth. And they fought for a long time, years and years, and then eventually, symbol-wise, he was blacklisted. He was not allowed to work ever in a hospital again. And then ultimately he was confined to an incident asylum where he was killed by the guards. And he died leaving a young family. And so that's what happens to you when you defy powerful people in Vienna in the 19th century and Freud didn't want the same fate. And he also had a young family. So this story is horrible, but if you don't believe me, you can go on Wikipedia. He was institutionalized in the same asylum by his colleagues, and in the asylum he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later. So this is a fate that will happen to you in Vienna if you defy powerful people. So now we have an explanation for why Freud made the transition, why he changed his story. But now there's another problem which is how does Freud convince his patients to go along? Right? Before he told his patients, I believe you, and they trusted him, and now he's changing his story. So how can you convince them that they in fact do suffer from sexual fantasies? And like this experience of sexual abuse, it's all just made up in the head. That's a very hard job to do. So the solution is interpretation of dreams. So Freud pined a new way of hypnotizing his patients. So together they would analyze your dreams. Because if you talk about their memories in their past, you're going to fight back. And it says, I remember very clearly. You talk about your dreams that allows you to suggest suddenly new ideas and new memories, to basically plant new memories and basically gaslight that person. Does that make sense? So the interpretation of dreams. So that is the story of Freud. Okay? But this leaves a question is, why did this spread throughout the world? All right? And that's something that we will look at in part three. So a lot of influence of Freud has to do with Carl Jung, who will take his ideas of the unconscious and systemize it for popular consumption. Okay? So we already discussed his framework, where we are all dualities, okay? We have an ego, we always have a shadow. We have a conscious, but also a unconscious, a personal as well as collective, an animus and an anima. Yong popularized ideas of personality types, right? Injivirt, extrovert, which is what we still use today. All right, the main influence is in modernism, transformative art movement beginning around the early 20th century. So arguably the first great modern artist is James Joyce, who in 1922 published Ulysses. James Joyce was Irish, he was an Irish expatriate, and he actually studied Dante in university. So he wrote Ulysses as a way to imitate almost surpass Dante. And of course Ulysses refers to Homer's Odyssey. Now we're going to read a passage from Ulysses to understand the power of writing. In unilable modality of the visible, at least that if no more thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I'm here to read, see spawn and see rack, the nearing tide that rats the boot. Start green, blue, silver, rust, colored signs, limits of the dying fun, but he adds in bodies. Okay. What does this mean? I have no idea. All right. I have no idea. I can explain to you, Don, I can explain to you Homer and Shakespeare, but I struggle with James Joyce. There are two reasons why. The first reason is he was a singer, so you have to read what he writes as though it's music. It's meant to be read aloud, so it's musical, and that's really the power of his writing. He's more focusing on the style rather than the substance. That's the first thing. Second thing is that he was extremely well read. And everything that he writes in every sentence, There are multiple allusions and references to other books. So you must have read what he read. You must have experienced what he experienced in order to understand him. And there are those who argue that Ulysses is the greatest book in the world. In fact, if you go online, you just Google the best book ever written in human history. James Joyce is up there. Ulysses is either number one or number two on this list of 50 best books in human history. And there are many who tell me, yeah, James Joyce is hard, but if you spend the time to go over what he's writing and connect the references, you will have a transformative intellectual experience. It's almost like doing a jigsaw puzzle. And that's all true, okay? But think about what they're saying. They're saying, what they're really saying is that James Joyce believes that he is God. He has the mind of God. And if you spend the time to understand what he writes, and it might take you years, decades, you will access the mind of God. That's very different from Dante, which is trying to use poetry to bring people into the mind of God, which is the truth of the world. Dante is a lot more accessible than James Joyce. So, let's look at the differences. Modern literature as represented by Ulysses, it is elitist, it's self-referential, okay? It just has a lot of illusions and references, but you actually don't know what the meaning is. Like what is the bigger story here? And it's used as something called Stream of Consciousness Writing, which is it's trying to capture the mind as it thinks and works, okay? That's different from Homer, who was very democratic. who was trying to bring beauty and truth to the people through epic poetry. So starting with modern literature, we have this abrupt change in the nature of literature before it was about empowering people to seek the truth for themselves. Now modern literature, it's really just this very elite club of very arrogant, haughty people. Okay? James Joyce was good friends with Virginia Woolf. In fact, Virginia Woolf actually published James Joyce. In 1927, Woolf published a book called To The Lighthouse, and it's probably her most famous work. And in it, she's also trying to respond to Joyce. To The Lighthouse, it's very much based on Homer's Odyssey. And it's extremely well written, okay? Okay, let's look at what she writes. There were the eternal problems, suffering, death, the poor. There was always a woman dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to all these children, you shall go through with it. To eight people, she had said, relentlessly say that, and the bill for the greenhouse would be 50 pounds. Okay, so what she's doing is she's reading a book and she's thinking about the issues raised by book. She's also thinking about life. Like, I have to go and do something, okay? And that's really how our minds work. So this captures really well, stream of consciousness thinking. And she's heavily influenced by Freud, right? She's trying to go into the unconscious and trying to figure out how the unconscious works. The Lighthouse is really about memory, about perception, about remembering, all right? But again, it's extremely self-indulgent and it's inward looking. And again, it's a radical departure from traditional literature. So let's compare modern literature with Dostoyevsky. Remember before we discuss Dostoyevsky. For Dostoyevsky, the heart is a deep, impenetrable ocean and our psychology responds to external events. We live in the world and respond to the world. We must surrender ourselves to others to seek salvation and redemption. We cannot rely on ourselves to forgive ourselves, to love ourselves. We must rely on others. We are in a community of people. So these are the truths of Dostoyevsky. When we into modern literature, self-discovery will allow for self-mastery. Our psychology responds to our suppressed memories. We can be our own salvation and redemption. It's too optimistic. It's too positive. It's saying that, hey, if you're poor, don't worry about it. As long as you think happy thoughts, you'll be good. This idea of positive psychology, right? And we have today. Cole Young and Freda Sumer for it also had a major influence on Pablo Picasso. And you can see it from his painting, Head of a Woman, okay? Now what you will notice is it's a cubist portrait of a woman, but if you look further, it's actually two people as well, okay? And so what this is doing is it's visually representing the theory of the self as presented by Jung, okay? So do you see the similarities? Great. Okay. So why is this art spreading throughout the world? Well, I mean, not to be conspiracy theorists, but let's look at an article, right? Was modern art really a CIA style? All right, so this article is from JSTOR, which is a academic journal, very mainstream. And let's read what it writes. In the mid 20th century, modern art and design represented the liberalism individualism, dynamic activity, and could have risked possible in a free society. So in other words, right now, the capitalist West is at war with communism. 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, communism is spreading all around the world. It's very popular among people. It calls for collective action. So the capitalist West, the powers that be, they're spreading Freud. They're spreading Joyce. They're spreading Wolf. They're spreading Holocaust, they're spreading all this art, this mariners art in order to create a coldest self. Because if you believe in the coldest of the self, if you believe that you are the source of everything, then you're not capable of collective action. So in many ways, this is a response to problem posed by communism. And this will be obviously most obvious during the Cold War. Does that make sense? All right. So why would that be bad? Why would the cult itself be bad? Well, this is Macau Buchanan, and he explains it very well in his writings. So let's read really quickly what he wrote. Having human in man and freedom above all is a product of a social collective labor. To be free and absolute isolation is absurdity invented by theologians and beneficent who have replaced the society of humans by that of God, their phantom. To say that each person feels free in the presence of God, that is, the presence of absolute emptiness, nothingness. Freedom in isolation then is the freedom of nothingness, or indeed, the nothingness of freedom, slavery. God, the figment of God, has been historically the moral source, or rather, the moral source of all slavery. So what he's saying is, the radical turning point in human history is the invention of Christianity, because it allows, it gives us the idea of individualism. And we think that's a good thing, because we're taught that individuality, individualism means free choice, it means freedom. What he's saying is that's an absurdity. We only have freedom from our community. We only have freedom if others are free around us. If we are free, but no one else is free, then we are slaves as well. So because individuality prevents us from working others from loving others, then that makes us slaves to ourselves. And that allows for the power of being in society to better control us. And so what he's saying is, Christianity is a slave religion. It was designed to make us all into slaves. And this world. And Puccanean lived in the 19th century. But if he read Freud, then he would also argue that the cult of psychoanalysis, it's really about entraping yourself in your own emotions. As for us, we want neither phantoms nor nothingness but living human reality, and we recognize that man can feel free, be free and therefore can achieve freedom. In order to be free, I need to see myself surrounded by man, by free men, and be recognized as such by them. I am free only when my individuality reflected in the mirror of the equally free consciousness of every individual around me comes back to me stringed from everyone's recognition. So what he's saying is this, if you want to be happy, if you want to be free, care about others, be kind to others, work with other people, sacrifice your own self-interest for the greater good. That is what will make you really happy. And that's generally true because think about this. If you're by yourself, will you be happy? Probably not. But if you have a family, you have kids, you don't have any freedom, but you're a happier person. In many ways, you're a more free person because you have better control of your emotions. You have more purpose in life. All right. So let's bring this to the present day, social media. Social media is, it is the democratization of the call to the self. Before, only the wealthy could enjoy the call to the self, right? Only the wealthy could take the time to self-indulge. But now, with social media, everyone can participate in the call to the self. And that has led to a global epidemic of depression, okay? So look at year 2015. You see this huge spike in depressive symptoms. Because 2015 is the year when we had access to smartphones. So now young people feel they can't do anything right. Life is not useful, and I do not enjoy life. This huge spike, which has led to a huge spike in suicide. And this is happening throughout the world, not only in North America and Europe, but also in Latin America and East Asia as well. So the color of the cell, which originated in Europe, has now conquered the world through technology. So that's it. So the answer to the three questions. The first question is, what did Freud get his idea? Second question, what did Freud break up with? The third question, why is Freud's idea so popular today? Well, it's all to serve the interests of the powerful. And that's the world we live in today. And the only solution we're going forward is if we rediscover our humanity, if we are able to find the courage to care about others and put the interests of others before our own interests, we ourselves must choose to kill the cult of the self. Okay, all right. So next class we will do nationalism."}

The end of the journey, the final class. So we've done a lot this year, right? Last semester we did the great books, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible, Republic, Divine Comedy. This semester we did how scripted the world is, right? The world is hopeless. We're all gonna die. And in this final class, I want this class to be about hope. And I want to show you the future. And the argument I want to leave you with, the thing that I want you to remember is that remember Daunte and my company said that the future is not what happens to you. It's not something that you wait for. The future is what you imagine and fight for. The future is what you make happen. There is a God, but God gave us the ability to imagine and the capacity to love. And it's these two things that will guide us and enable us to build a better world. Okay? So that's the message I want to give to you today. The future is what we imagine, not what we have to put up with. So if we don't like the future, if we don't like the way we live our lives, then we can change that with our imagination. And today I want to show you how. So just to summarize what we did this semester, together we analyzed the world. And we made certain predictions about the world, right? For example, that Trump will be elected again in November and that he would declare war on Iran. And this war in Iran will be a disaster for the United States and it will mean the end of the American Empire and it would lead to a multipolar world which will mean endless war and the deaths of millions and billions of people. And because of climate change, our world will eventually collapse at some point. Okay? So this is an extremely hopeless, an extremely bleak and dark picture of the world. But remember, where there is darkness, there can also be light. So in this final class, I want to show you some hope and some light. Okay? So this is what we call psycho-history. And psycho-history is the idea that the future can be predicted. And if it can be predicted, then it can be controlled and harnessed for the betterment of humanity, OK? So where does this idea come from, psycho-history? In the 1950s, there was an American science fiction writer named Isaac Asimov. And he's probably the most famous science fiction writer. If you happen to read science fiction, he's really famous. And he wrote a series called Foundation. And I think there's a TV series now based on foundation books. It's terrible, but you can have a look at it. And in the foundation books, he introduces the idea of psycho history. And so this book is set in the future, like a million years from now, where there is a galactic empire. So humanity has colonized the entire Milky Way. There are billions of planets, and there's an empire that brings peace to this Milky Way. But with all empires, it has to collapse, and this will lead to 30,000 years of war, violence, barbarity. And the foundation proposes a new science called psycho-history, which is to mathematically map out human behavior over the course of a million years. You do that, what you discover is that there are certain patterns to human society, okay? And if that's the case, then you can predict the future. If you can do that, then you can manipulate the course of events to make a better future. So this is what they call psycho-history. And it's a science fiction concept. And a lot of people have been trying to make it into reality. So there's this very prominent historian. His name is Peter Turkin, and he's one of the founders of something called Cleodynamics. Okay? And Cleo is the goddess of history. Dynamics just means movement. So basically, Cleodynamics is trying to figure out the mathematical movement of history. He's trying to create history as a mathematical model. And when he did that, there's certain interesting trends and patterns that he discovered. And one idea that he discovered is something called the overproduction of the elites, overproduction of the elite. And this concept explains why societies collapse. Now traditionally we've understood the collapse of societies as having to do with maybe be like too much debt or too much inequality or maybe climate change or war right? What Peter Turkin points out, and it's a really interesting idea is the reason why society's collapsed in the end is you have too many elites. Alright? So let me explain the concept. Okay, so society has many elites right? You have people like Jack Ma, right? You have people like Zhou Xun, Zhao Wei, right? Movie stars. You have famous military generals, okay? So over time, elites become more and more numerous, right? Number of wealthy people go up. The number of famous people go up. The number of entrepreneurs go up, okay? The problem though is is they all want power, right? Now wealth and fame are all infinite resources, right? But power will always be a finite resource. In fact, it's what we call a zero sum game. So for example, in this classroom, there can only be one teacher, right? If we're all teachers, there's no teacher. So in society, there can only be a few powerful people. If everyone has a power, no one has any power. So what happens over time is that all these people who believe they should have power struggle for power. And because there are too many of them, this internal struggle of the elites ultimately leads to social collapse. So the most famous example is in China, in Imperial China, where you have the Khe Ju system, right? People taking the Imperial examinations to become an official. Problem is, you have too many candidates, not enough positions, right? And guess who ultimately gets upset with society and leads revolutions? It's the Khe Ju candidates who did not become officials. And so they become angry and they lead revolutions to overflow society, right? So the most classic example of the failed Khejue candidate is Hong Xiu-Tran. Do you guys know who he is? The leader of the Tai Ping Rebellion, right? Why did he become a Christian? Why did he lead the rebellion? Because he failed the Khejue, okay? So that's the idea of the over-production of the elite. And he discovered this principle using mathematically modeling of history. He just compared different societies and tried to figure out why they collapsed. And what he discovered is, well, it's because of the internal struggle among the different elite groups. And that's why the Roman Empire collapsed as well. Does that make sense? What I'm proposing to you is that we can actually go a step further in what Peter Turkin is doing, because we have something called now called AI, okay? Artificial Intelligence. And we can harness the power of AI to create real cycle history, which is the ability to not just analyze the past, but to predict the future, okay? All right. So let's first figure out what AI is. So first I want us to understand what artificial intelligence is. Because most of you think you know, but you actually know. So what is AI? All right, the AI, the technical term, is supervised machine learning. That's the technical term. AI is the popular term, but supervised machine learning is the technical and correct term. Have you guys heard of this term? Supervised machine learning. Yes or no? Have any of you taken computer science? Okay, this is called supervised machine learning. Okay, so what is this? Okay, so in computer programming, you're taught to write the algorithm, right? And then the input. You put in information, it gives you the output. And this is traditionally how computers work. You write the algorithm, the computer program, you put in information, and then there's an output. For example, the algorithm could be A plus B. So you put in two numbers. Two, two, you get a four. That's how computers work. Now, supervised machine learning is that I will turn the output into the input. And the reason why I want to do that is that as a human being, I myself may not be able to write the best algorithm. So I want the computer to refine the algorithm for me, to optimize it using the output. Does that make sense? So let's talk about a very specific example. All right? So let's talk about facial recognition technology. You go to the airport, and you scan, and they know who you are. You go to a supermarket, you scan your face, and you pay. You're like, wait, how does that work? OK. So how this works is that there's database, okay, about one billion people, like everyone in China. And now what I need to do is figure out how to differentiate the faces of everyone in China in this database. Okay, does that make sense? So what I do is for the face I create a mathematical model based on topology. Okay, does that make sense? That's the apology. So I turn everyone's face into a mathematical model, which looks like something like this. And you're like, I don't know what this is. You don't need to know what this is. This is like super complicated. But all you need to know is that within this model, there are different equations. So for example, this model is trying to analyze the distance between your eyes and how big your nose is. All right, does that make sense? All right? And so once I create this mathematical model, I am now able to differentiate everyone in China. Does that make sense? Okay, in fact, this mathematical is so precise that I can only look at your eyes and I know who you are. Okay? Because what I'm trying to do is match but your model with a model in the database. But what's important to remember is that if you're not in this database, you can't be recognized. Do you understand? Now, what I will show you is how this model is created. So what happens is this. What I do is I teach the computer how to create this database. So I have input of output. And then what I do is I create a working thesis, or a working theory of what this model should look like. Doesn't make sense. So it can be like this. And then what I do is I put faces. And the output should match what's in the database. And if the model returns something that's different, I tell them this is wrong. And what the computer then does is refine this model until it becomes this. Doesn't make sense, OK? So what all AI is is infinite iteration. Doesn't make sense, all right? So the problem with AI is I need to be able to solve three things. And if I can solve three things, then I can create an AI. The first thing is that I need clear metrics or clear outputs. Doesn't make sense. I need outputs that I can define as a mathematical model. So for example, if I'm in airline, I'm going to use AI to maximize the amount of money I make on a flight. That's my output. How much money can I make out of a flight? I want to have the maximum amount of profit. That's the first thing I need to solve. Second thing I need to solve then is data for input. But the thing about data is that it has to be clean. Does that make sense? It has to be a clean data. So for example, if I want to teach this AI to recognize different animals, I need to give it different data sets of different animals. Does that make sense? I need to label my data. But I can't tell. I can't make an AI that's like, this is the best ice cream in the world. And the reason why is I can't find data on the best ice cream. You understand? Because ice cream, the best ice cream is subjective. So I cannot turn that into a data set. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, the third thing I need to do is create a working algorithm structure. You understand? Okay? Computers can only refine and optimize the algorithm structure. It cannot create it by itself. Okay? So if I'm able to do all three things, then I'm able to use AI to optimize what I wanted to optimize. All right? Any questions so far before I move on? So what this means is that there are certain problems that I can solve using AI. And there are certain problems I cannot solve using AI. So what are easy problems that AI can solve? Well, for example, facial recognition technology. Also, translation software. I can create an optimal translation software. Also, recommendation engines. So if you watch a movie on Netflix, it recommends another movie. Now let me ask you this question. Can I ever solve self-driving cars? Can I ever solve self-driving cars? Self-driving cars. Can cars drive by themselves? Yes or no? Why are you asking? OK, the answer is no. What's the answer no? OK, the answer no is whatever I do, OK, I cannot solve something called the edge case. The edge case is if the car is on the road, What could happen that would screw up my AI system? You guys know? What can't self-driving cars be solved? What can't we have self-driving cars on the roads? What's an edge case? Or this thing that I can never solve? What is it? Excuse me? Yeah, and what is not planned? Hmm? They can plan for traffic. What can they not plan for? And this is why we'll never have self-driving driving cars. They can plan for accidents. What can they not plan for? Easily plan for traffic rules. What can they not plan for? Okay guys, the edge case with self-driving cars is if I as a human being intentionally want to crash into that car, you understand? Does that make sense to you guys? Every other situation I can plan for. But in a situation where I'm the human being and I don't like self-driving cars because I'm a taxi driver and it's still in my job, Right, it's still in my life, likelihood. And I wanna crash in that car. There's no way for that AI to avoid the accident. Doesn't make sense, okay? Listen, listen. AI is a scam, okay? It does not exist. What exists is supervised machine learning, okay? What is supervised machine learning? What I just told you, okay? That's it. That's the extent of our technology. It does not have self-awareness. It can only do what the algorithm tells it to do. And there's no way you can design an algorithm that plans for and prevents a human being who intentionally wants to crash into you. Does that make sense? So AI, in other words, is an extremely limited tool. So you think about actual applications of AI. It's very limited. You also look at self-driving cars. Now, there are cars that have self-driving features, but they are not 100% self-driving. Okay, does that make sense? In fact, they tell you, don't rely on the autopilot, okay? It's there to help you, but don't sleep in the car, okay? Right? Because they don't have an AI system in place to prevent people from crashing into them, okay? Does that make sense? All right, so now that we know what AI is, let's talk about how we can use AI to predict the future, okay? All right, so basically, what you need to do is three things, right? You need to be clear about the output. you need to have clean data, and you need to have a working algorithm. Does that make sense? And so that's what I've been doing this semester. So for example, remember my predictions. The Israel lobby, Saudi Arabia, and the American Empire, basically the need to protect the petrovalder will force America to go to war with Iran. These are the push factors. The problem is that there are no force to counteract this. So for example, the military will be for this because they have shock and awe and they are very confident they can win this war. Iran itself wants this war because it wants revenge against America. Okay? And then the president of the United States will be Donald Trump. He wants this war in order to cement his position as president. Okay? And so because of this, we can predict that there'll be a war in Iran. Does that make sense? Okay. Okay, now given this prediction, what we can then do is use mathematical modeling and statistics to turn this into an AI model. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? Now we have the AI model. Now that we have the AI model, what we need to do now is to refine it. The way we refined it is by going back in history and looking at every single war that started. Doesn't make sense. And so you take this model and you look at the different wars. So for example, the 415 BCE invasion of Sicily by Athens. You look at 1941, Operation Barbarossa. You have basically hundreds of wars that you can look at. And then you take this model, and then you test it using each of these wars. And what will happen is that the model will begin to refine itself. Doesn't make sense. So it becomes more and more refined. But then that's one model for what causes war. I've also said that Trump will become president, right? Well then that's another model that you can use. And once you start putting all these models together, what eventually happens over time is you develop psycho history, okay? Does this make sense, guys? All right? So now the question then is, okay, How would this AI model work? Or what are the ideas behind this model? So we talk about game theory analysis a lot. The idea of game theory analysis is that, OK, guys, there's really no good and evil. There are different players in the game, and they're all self-interested. They all want to win this game. So they're going to develop strategies that optimize their ability to win this game. Okay? So you can use game theory analysis. But then you can also develop new ideas that would help you better understand how the world works, okay? So let's talk about certain ideas that have come up in this course. All right? So one thing I want to talk about is this week's European elections. Have you guys seen the news? The elections to the European Parliament, right? And the results are pretty shocking because it signals a clear shift to the right. So for example, Mary Lapin's party in France picked up a lot of votes. The AFD, the Alternative for Germany in Germany, which is considered a right wing organization, almost neo-Nazi, has picked up a lot of votes as well. The results were so dramatic that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, has called for an early election. And it's possible in three months time, Mary Lapin's party will run and govern France. So how do we explain this shift to the right? And I want to explain three reasons. The first reason is anti-immigration. So for the past 10, 20 years, there have been a lot of immigrants to Europe from Libya, from Syria, from Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, okay? These are mainly Muslim people who threaten the Christian social fabric of Europe, okay? And now Europeans are rebelling or revolting against that. Second thing that they don't like about Europe so far is the idea of federalism, okay? or they can say bureaucratism. But it's the idea that a foreign power Brussels mandates rules that they must follow. So they think it's very anti-democratic, okay? And the third thing that they're rebelling against is the idea of pan-Europeanism. What the people Europe are saying is there's no European identity, guys. There's a German identity. There's a French identity, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, but there's no European identity. They're rebelling against the entire project of the EU. In fact, I would bet that in about five years time, the entire EU would be dead, okay? Why are they opposed to Europeanism? Europeanism? Because ultimately they believe that it's about destroying local identity. It's about destroying local community. It's about destroying my relationship with my neighbors and my friends and my relatives, okay? And my family. Does that make sense? Okay? It's It's imposing a foreign identity on me. And proponents of the European Union would argue that, no, this is just a secular liberal idea. The entire idea of the EU is that for hundreds of years, thousands of years, Europe has been at war. Why has Europe been at war? Tribalism, right? Religion. So the entire project of the EU is to get rid of the factors that lead to war. Local identity, nationalism, religion, right? And what the European voters are saying to the EU is, sorry, we don't want secular liberalism because we want to be human, okay? What we strive for is not a abstract liberal idea. We strive for structure, meaning, and purpose in our lives. Okay? What we really strive for is the capacity to love, create, and learn, okay, and grow. Does that make sense? That's what we are fundamentally as human beings. And when you ask me to obey an abstract foreign entity that is very far from me, then you are limiting or destroying a structure, meaning, and purpose in my life. And so that's what's going on. Not just in Europe, but throughout the world. You think about Brexit, right? You think about the election of Donald Trump, right? All these things has to do with this fundamental human urge to have structure, meaning, and purpose in our lives, okay? Have agency, okay? Doesn't make sense, guys. All right, any questions so far? Yeah, Eric? Okay, so Eric asks, okay, What is the source of all of this? And what Dante and Homer would say is the human heart, the human heart. This is just who we are. And if we cannot fulfill our human heart, we will rebel, we will destroy, we will want to kill. And so in other words, one idea in this AI model is that there is a fundamental underlying structure to human society. If society conforms to the structure of the human heart, this society will prosper. For example, Athens, danger in Greece. That's a prosperity prosper. The word we use was eudaimonia. But if society represses the human heart, then ultimately the society will have to collapse at some point. So that's another principle that we can use when developing this AI model. The last idea that we can use in developing this AI model is the idea of synchronicity, okay? Synchronicity. And the idea of synchronicity is, As a society, how willing are people in following the rules? It doesn't make sense. So when you drive the car, do people actually follow traffic rules? When you're in the subway, do people actually give up their seats for the elderly, for children, for pregnant women? When you go to the park, do people actually pick up garbage and throw it in the garbage bin? Sequinicity tells us that there's a cohesion and trust in society. That society is resilient. And that society can grow or learn from its mistakes. So societies that have high sequinicity will do better in the long term inside societies with low sequinicity. And so societies with high sequinicity would include Japan and Germany, right? And societies with low sequency would include India and Brazil and China, okay? Does that make sense? All right? So these are all of the ideas that we developed this semester or in this year. That there's an underlying truth and meaning to human society. And if we embrace these truths, then society will prosper. But if we try to deny these truths, then eventually, society will have to collapse and we have to start over again. Does that make sense? Any questions so far? Yeah, Celine? Excuse me? OK, that's a great question. So one thing that was not supposed to happen is the idea of mass society. Mass society. You can say that mass society is a complete, what's the word I'm looking for? Deviation from human history, okay? We're not supposed to have mass society. And mass society is completely an accident, a historical accident. But when you have mass society, what happens is that you need an elite, okay? You need an elite. But guess what guys? The elite, the people in charge, they're not better than you and me, okay? You understand? We in this classroom could, we could swap for the leadership of the world, right? And guys, nothing would change. You understand? Right? So you have mass society and therefore you have to have an artificial elite. Because you need people in control. And because they're in control, they need to now maintain the illusion of their power. Okay? They need to create fictions. For example, maybe, well, I went to Yale or Harvard and therefore I should be at the top or maybe I'm a higher IQ than you do or maybe, you know, my dad or my great, great, great, great grandfather was king. Okay? They had to create these fictions. Now what happens over time is that these fictions far apart because they're not that competent. Okay. And the most recent example is you look at the global management of the economy. And you look at the global management of like COVID. Okay. You look at the global management of war. It's pretty incompetent. And so people sort of wake up and like, wait a minute, these guys don't really know what they're doing. Okay. And now, so now the elite is now forced to suppress us. Okay, that's a lie. They have to use force to make us obedient. Okay, and that's what's happening today. And so this repression can go on for a long time, but to control us, they must repress the human heart. Because it's in the human heart to want to question, to be curious, to grow. Okay? And if you think the people in charge don't know what they're doing, then you're sort of compelled to challenge them. And so what they have to do is suppress the human heart. And they do that by trying to get you to focus on buying things rather than thinking. Does that make sense? Okay, all right, any more questions? Yes, yeah, Sally? Yes. Yeah, and it has to turn into a mathematical model. Okay, you understand? So human heart has to become like a model, like facial recognition model. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, so Sally's question is, isn't it true that we're all individual and unique? And isn't it true that over time we change, okay? And that's a great point. But what Homer and Dante would say that, no, no, no, no, at the fundamental level, okay? We all have the same desires. We're motivated by the same needs. There's no one in this world that does not want structure, meaning, and purpose. Now the way you want to achieve this may be different, but that's your underlying motivation. And there's no person in this world that does not seek to achieve these three things, like love, create, and grow as people. That's when you achieve full happiness as a person. When you feel that you're married to someone you love and you have children, when you're doing a job that is creative and when you're constantly learning every day and growing every day, okay? When you achieve that, these three things, what do we call this? When you achieve all three things, what do we call this? Eudaimonia, right? This is the eudaimonia. This is what the Greeks meant by a happy and self-fulfilled life. It doesn't make sense. So there may be differences in needs and motivation. But at the fundamental level, we're all human beings. And we're all driven by the same fundamental needs. Does that make sense? OK. Yeah. Yes. OK. So Sally asked the question, how do you construct this AI? Okay, and so for this AI to be valid, okay, let me explain how we would actually implement it, okay? So, first of all, you need at least 50 to 100 years to actually create this AI, okay? And the reason why is that for this AI to be valid, you constantly need to be testing it, okay? So what I've been doing this class is basically doing a self-AI, right? where I have an integral model and I have a prediction. But guess what guys, we won't know if my predictions are fully correct until like 50 years from now. Is that correct? Therefore I can't validate my analysis until 50 years from now. Does that make sense? And you need to be constantly doing this where you have to be constantly making these predictions and seeing if they're correct or not. If they're not correct, what you have to do is go and change these predictions and analysis. Does that make sense? Then what you have to do is you basically have to, and this is actually what's the most time consuming, is you have to rewrite history. You understand? Because most of history is actually not correct. So what you have to do is you have to take this AI model and look back at history and says, according to this AI model, what actually happened in the Peloponnesian War? What actually happened in World War I? What actually happened during the time of Dynasty? So you basically have to challenge the entire discipline of history and reconstruct a new history that you think is more factually correct based on this AI. Okay, so you have to be doing these two things at once. Okay, making these predictions, it seems that you're correct, but also going back to throughout history and seeing how history can be revamped or changed so that it's more accurate, okay? Does that make sense? Okay, that's a project. But then there's the technology, because you actually need mathematicians and computer programmers and historians to collaborate together to build this AI, right? So I can tell you how I would analyze the issue, but then a mathematician has to turn this into a mathematical equation or a model, okay? Because computers only recognize data and numbers. They don't recognize ideas. I can't talk to a computer. I have to give a computer a number or a equation or model for it to calculate on. Does it make sense? So it's not an easy project. But the argument is that if this project actually works, it would change the fate of humanity forever. Because if there's one thing that you notice in this class, it's like we tend to repeat the same mistakes. The question is, why do we do that? It's because the history that we have is complete bullshit. It just is, it's not true, it can't be true. There's things that we believe, which if you just think about it, can't be true. And we did that last semester when we talked about the rise of Christianity. You're telling me that this illiterate guy named Jesus was able to spread Christianity all by himself after he died, I don't believe that. I think a much easier explanation is that it became co-opted by the Roman Empire in order to control the Empire. Right? But if you were to talk to a historian, they would say you're just wrong. So not only are you trying to predict the future, but you're trying to also correct the past, which is, I think, an even more difficult job. Any more questions? Yeah, Eric? Excuse me? So Eric asked a great question. Will this cycle history model encounter education? The answer is that's the best question, OK? That's a great question. And the answer is yes, what are edge cases? Do you guys know what are edge cases in this model? What would be edge cases here in history? It's called great man theory, OK? Great man theory. And this is a problem. Meaning like, okay, we believe, we argue that these underlying historical forces control humanity, right? But now and then, you have this great man kind of nowhere, and he changes the course of human history forever, okay? The example is before we had Homer, right? Then we had Dante, then we had Plato, Jesus, Julius Caesar, Octavius, Quentin today, okay? We can't account for these people because by definition they're beyond history. They can step outside of history and control history. That's what great men are. So how does your model account for that? Okay, and the answer is you cannot. So in foundation, okay, the solution, okay, so there's a solution to this. The solution is to create another organization. Okay, remember that technical history is an AI model. It's basically a computer. But as Eric points out, you will always have edge cases. You'll always have someone up here out of nowhere And for a reason, he's able to manipulate events to control and direct history in its favor. So what you do to solve this problem is you create another organization. And in Asimov's foundation, it's called the Second Foundation. The idea of the Second Foundation is that there is a computer. There is the AI. But behind the AI are a team of specialists who observe the AI, who observe history, and who correct the AI for edge cases, okay? Does that make sense? So if Putin appears and is like, okay, well clearly I'm not accounting for Putin, well then I changed the equations in the AI to account for Putin, okay? So this team of experts, the second foundation, will correct the AI. Now, what's interesting about the Sex-Sanct foundation is that these people are telepaths, meaning that they can read your mind. Not only can they read your mind, but they can throw your mind. And that's another really interesting motorcycle history. There's a promise that we can predict the future, but there's also a promise that that within our minds there are some special abilities that we might have the potential for but we never ever fully attempted to achieve. Okay? Does that make sense? And is it possible in the future that telepaths will rise? I think yes. And the answer is that you can make the argument that these edge cases that Eric refers these great men of history, they're actually telepaths. Okay, does that make sense? They're actually telepaths. So some like Putin. Why is Putin able to do what he does? And you can make the argument like he has almost some telepathic abilities. Okay? He can read other people's minds. He can control other people's minds. How else can you explain that someone who does not come from a special background? He's not of the Russian elite. But he's able to amass so much power all by himself in only a few decades so that today he's basically the emperor of Russia. And of Russia, he eats his command. Russia just moves the way that he wants it to move. So you can make the argument that Putin is almost a telepath. And is it possible that in the future, we'll have more telepaths, and we can over time harness the power of these telepaths to create the second foundation and to control psychohistory? Possibly, right? Because how else we explain great man? You look at someone like Homer and Dante, right? The only explanation that you can have for Homer and Dante is they had God giving gifts, or maybe God was speaking to them, or maybe they were just speaking for God. That's the only explanation that you can have for Homer and Dante, because they so clearly stepped out of history and directed history. Does that make sense? But thanks for the question, Eric. So edu cases are great men who appear now and then, And you cannot ever predict these people. Okay? Any more questions? Okay. This, yeah? Yes, Celine? Oh, that's a great question, okay. Um, okay. How do you model love, learn, and create, okay? And the answer is that there has to be a certain amount of autonomy or agency in the lives of people. Does that make sense? What we call freedom and liberty. Because if you have freedom and liberty, then you're able to do what you want. And what you want to do is love, create, and grow. Does that make sense? So you need to model agency and freedom into the structure. The second thing is social interaction. In other words, the more we're able to interact with each other, the more we're willing to love, create, and grow. Because these powers come from others, right? You can't love yourself, you have to love someone else. You can't create by yourself, you have to create in a group, okay? You can't learn by yourself, you have to learn from others. So you also have to model in as much group interaction as possible. And the last thing is you also have to model in the idea of compassion. So the idea here is that if I all put you on an island together and you must survive, well, you will become compassionate with each other because that's the only way to survive, right? But if I put you guys into a bank and I say to you that if you make a million dollars and I give you two million dollars, whoever makes the most money, I will give a Ferrari to, guess what, guys, you all hate each other. You all want to kill each other, okay? You understand? So this model also has to factor in compassion. How compassionate is the society? Okay. Because if you have compassion, then people are willing to work together. If you are willing to work together, then people have the greater capacity to love, create and grow. Okay. Does that make sense? Actually guys, we have all these theories. Is this like no one's turned this into a mathematical model? Okay. For society. Any more questions? Yeah. Yeah. So Eric asked the question, is it possible to completely understand human behavior and motivation? And there are two different ways of looking at the issue. The first way is to use a social science approach. So you look at economics, psychology, anthropology, sociology. What are they trying to do? They're trying to figure out mathematically what drives us. You understand? But there's another approach. It's called the literature approach, which is that we can't actually quantify or explain human behavior. But there are truths that can be expressed in literature. Doesn't make sense. So think about the very first book we read, the Iliad, where Achilles has killed Hector, and Prime wants a body back. So Prime sneaks into Achilles' tent and kisses his head. That moment, you can never mathematically express it. You can only write about it. But think about how much truth and power is in that one scene. Does that make sense? Eric, OK? So again, I think someone like Homer and Dante, like their mission is to express to us in the most beautiful way the human truths, OK? Like what drives us? And Dono is very explicit. He says that what drives us is love and the willingness to imagine, OK? That's who we are. If we love, we'll be more human. If we imagine, we'll be more human. And that's really the argument I make as well. And that has to be the underlying truth of whatever AI model you create. Any more questions? Yeah? OK, so Celine asks a great question. OK, well, if it says that we want to love, create, and grow, then why do we end up destroying ourselves? And the answer is that love and hate are one force. You understand? If I can't love you, I'm going to hate you. You understand? Guess what, guys? Creation and destruction is one force as well. If I can't create, then I want to destroy, because my need for creation can't be satisfied. Doesn't make sense. So a society that nurtures our willingness to love and create and grow like the Greeks will flourish. But eventually you reach a point where the elite have a mass power. They've centralized and consolidated power. And so they want to turn everyone else into basically a slave. When you're a slave, you can't love. You can't create, you can't learn, you can't grow. Therefore, you rebel and you destroy the society. It doesn't make sense. But again, the fundamental human need are these three things, but within each of these things is another force. And if love can't express itself, then hate will express itself. Does that make sense? Okay, all right. Any more questions? Yeah? So Sally asked a great question, which is like, who would control this AI? And how can we ensure that this AI is not exploited by the elite in order to justify their corruption and cruelty, okay? And the answer has to be really the second foundation, basically a group of scholars, academics, experts, who dedicate themselves to this AI. Okay? And this AI, the other thing is that it has to be open and transparent. That's why it's so hard to build, right? It has to be open and transparent. Okay? If it's open and transparent, then everyone has to agree that this AI is gonna be used for good, okay? Meaning that what this AI does is, you can ask it different questions, and it will give you different scenarios. And we can all agree on which snow we want. And therefore, we can agree on what action to take. So this AI has to be part of a democratic system where everyone is involved. Otherwise, as Sally points out, it can only be abused. It can only be used to oppress others. But the point of this AI is that it gives us a platform as humans to agree on certain actions that we must stick together. OK? Does that make sense? So for example, we can all agree that climate change is bad. We can all agree that war is bad, right? But this AI will actually give us solutions to these problems, because this AI can map up the future for us. And the AI will say, well, listen, if the United States intervenes in Ukraine, then this will happen. Right? The United States attacks Iran, then this will happen. And that becomes a very powerful argument for correct and proper behavior. Okay? Does that make sense? All right? But again, guys, this is just conjecture, okay? And I've already said this, it's going to take at least 50 to 100 years to build this AI and you will be up against tremendous opposition, right? Historians aren't going to like this. The elite aren't going to like this, right? But at the same time, we have to remember that guess what? Homer, I'm pretty sure if Homer were living in a centralized society, the elite would be opposed to him, okay? Because he was making fun of very famous Greeks, like Achilles, and Menelots, and Agamemnon, right? He was making fun of these guys. Well, guess what? When Homer's writing, society collapsed, right? When Dante was writing, society collapsed. So if it is true, if my predictions are correct and society is approaching collapse, then there should be a lot of space and leeway and flexibility to create this AI, okay? Okay. Any more questions? Yeah. That's a great question. So if the won't different people, different nations want different outcomes. And the answer is, yeah, like if you are alive today, if you're America, you want America to be a hegemon. If you're Putin, you want Russia to be the hegemon. If you're China, you want China to be the hegemon, right? You want different outcomes. So my argument is that the structure of society today is not sustainable. Everything's gonna collapse. And we are going to transition from a population about eight billion people to a population of one billion people. And when you have one billion people and like there's no place to grow crops and pollution is everywhere and war is everywhere, guess what happens? Humans are united in their goals. Which is basically how do we create a better civilization? Okay? Doesn't make sense. When officer that has collapsed, everyone's like, how do we recreate civilization? That's the goal. But in a more progressive, more democratic, and more prosperous way. Okay? That's what I'm betting on. But I don't know. Okay? And again, if everyone's fighting over the AI, this AI cannot be created. Okay? Because different people will want this AI to be biased in a different way. And I can only work if it steps outside of history and steps outside of human interests. If it's speaking for all humanity, rather than one nation or one group of people. Okay, any more questions? Is this clear to you guys? All right, so, all right. So this is the very end and I'll spend like five more minutes to talk about this year. So, this is the very first time I've taught both courses, okay? In the first semester, we read the great books. And I was blown away by how much you guys enjoyed the great books and how much you benefit from reading the great books, okay? And quite honestly, I don't think anyone has tried this before. I know there are great books courses in university, but not at the pace that we had, and certainly not at the level of difficulty that we had. So you guys should be proud of yourself because the great books courses was very hard. And you enjoyed it. Even today, most of you really like the Iliad, right? You guys still remember the Iliad and think very highly of it, okay? So that's very impressive, so thank you. This semester is also a new course where we looked at geopolitics. And I'm also very impressed by how much you've grown as well in this course. The way you guys think it's much more logical, much more analytical. you guys are asking great questions, okay? So thank you again because you don't have to work hard in this course, but you chose to work hard. And this is gonna carry you very far in life, okay? So the course has come to an end. And I will share with you why I teach this course, right? Okay, because some of you know I do have a very prestigious education background as well as a career background. Okay, and I could have been what a lawyer, I think a lawyer, a rich lawyer, a professor. Okay, but instead I'm teaching high school in China. Right, why am I doing this? It's because I have three kids, okay? I have three young kids. My eldest is six, my youngest is only about eight months, okay? And as a father, you have to believe in a better world. But not only do you have to believe in a better world, you have to imagine, you have to fight for it because you have to leave behind a legacy for your children. So why teach this course is to bring you a message of hope. Like through your own imagination, through your own hard work, you can create a better world. You don't have to sit back and just let the world happen. You don't have to wait for the future. You can make it happen. And if you really work hard at it, you can make the world a better place. And I think like this year has proven to me that I can make the world a better place if I work hard because I've seen the growth in all of you. Okay? So I hope we can stay in touch. I hope that you will tell me how you progress because I'm very confident that all of you will do very well in university and in life. And maybe at some point, we can share this dream of psycho-history, you know? I know it sounds very complicated, it's very abstract, but to make this work, you need a lot of people working together, okay? And it's something that's gonna happen tomorrow, but it's something that we might come back to later on in our lives, okay? So that's it. Thank you and we'll see you in touch, okay?"}

So today we will do Germany and thus conclude our discussion of the four great civilizations that are fighting for global dominance. We previously did Britain, America, Tuesday we did Russia, today we do Germany. So to recap, Russian civilization is It's very distinct from American, so Anglo-American civilization, and German civilization is also distinct as well. We're gonna focus on the idea of unity of will in German civilization today. We don't know much about German civilization because they were defeated in World War II. And because the Anglo-Americans control the history of the world, we tend to think Anglo-American civilization is superior to German and Russian civilization. But what I will show you today is that in many respects, the most advanced civilization that humans have ever created is actually the German civilization. Okay, so if you look at a map today in Europe, there's a really interesting fact that may surprise you. The green is Russia. Okay, it's a larger country in the world. Over here are the Baltic nations. And over here is a place called Kalenegrad. It's actually Russian. Okay, so the question then is, how did this come to pass? How was it that you've got this colony of Russians far away from the motherland? And the answer is this, because historically this was not Russian. Historically this was a place called Kahnensberg, which is part of a nation that no longer exists called Prussia. And for a couple hundred years, Prussia was the strongest military, the most advanced civilization in the world. And now it's disappeared. And it's been replaced by Poland, okay, and parts of Belarus. And West Prussia has now become part of Germany, okay? But pressure is no longer its extinct. And the reason why is that in World War II, the allies who won the war, the Soviet Union, the British and Americans decided to destroy pressure. And the rationale was that pressure is a militaristic society that is hell bent on world domination. and by eliminating pressure, we can now bring peace to the world. The problem though is that Connorsburg, which is now Calenagrad, was really the center of civilization for a few decades. This is Connorsburg before in 1800s. As you can see, it's a beautiful port city by the Baltic Sea. and it was really the apex of human civilization. Then of course, World War II happened, and then after World War II, Collinsburg was destroyed, was turning into rubble. Today, it's like this, a very Soviet stale city with no character, with no culture, with no civilization. That's the intent to turn to destroy Kahnersberg, which was for the longest time the heart and soul of German civilization. It is true that Kahnersberg and pressure were extremely powerful, was extremely powerful military nation and as you can see, this is Wikipedia by the way, okay? As you can see there are many great generals and officers who are from Kahnersberg, okay? We're talking about the city. We're not talking about the nation pressure. We're just talking about the city of Connorsburg. But you will also see that there are many intellectuals, writers, who come from Connorsburg. And the most famous of these intellectuals is Immanuel Kant, who will discuss next class. He basically changed the course of Western history with his philosophy. So, Connorsburg was the birthplace of Emmanuel Codd. So how is it that the man who is most responsible for the enlightenment happens to be born in a military stagnation? Okay, that's a question. But not only Emmanuel Codd, but you have also many other great thinkers, including Hannah Orat, who is a Jewish philosopher and who is considered one of the greatest political philosophers of the 20th century. She's also from Connorsburg. Scientists, just an amazing group of scientists as well as mathematicians. Then, of course, you have musicians and artists. So the contribution of Kahnisberg towards civilization cannot be overstated. There are quite a few Jews who lived in Kahnisberg. Connors Burke for the longest time was considered one of the most tolerant cities in Germany for Jews I all we know let's now look at Nobel Prize winners in the sciences physics chemistry and medicine As you can see in 1925 the majority were actually from Germany Okay, Germany had the best scientists in the world 1933, same thing. You got on 1950, same thing. And by 1975, Germany is still dominant. The United States is catching up. It's only by about 2000 when the United States starts to take over, overtake Germany. So again, the question then is, how is it possible for a militaristic nation, hell-bent on world domination, how are they able to produce so many great scientists, so many great philosophers? And this is a very famous quote from Moutere that captures the prejudice of the West against Prussia, where some states have an army, the Prussian army has a state. Okay? This is pretty insulting to Prussian culture. We've looked at many civilizations that are militaristic, okay, including the Romans, Spartans, Aztecs, Macedonians and Qing Chinese, among others. They're extremely successful militarily, but guess what? They were not creative. In fact, they were anti-creative. So how is it possible for the Prussians to be both creative and militaristic? And the answer is, because the Western prejudice against pressure is wrong. They were not a militaristic nation bent on world domination. They were first and foremost a creative humanistic society that was forced into military confrontation which is neighbors because of its geographic location. Okay? So, let's go back to the history of the Holy Roman Empire. As we discussed in a previous class, the Holy Roman Empire was a confederation of German city-states. And there were like thousands and thousands of them that were in competition with each other. Okay? Over time, because of competition from the more powerful states like France, Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Sweden, these city-states were now forced to gel together. The most successful of these city-states is Prussia. Okay? And for the longest time, Prussia was a vast state of the Polish, Lithuania Commonwealth, or the Swedes. Okay? But by the year 1700, it started to come into its own through the leadership, through great military leadership. Okay, and it starts to spread out. And as you can see, it's spreading out really quickly because of its military victories and because of its high culture. By the 19th century, pressure has dedicated itself to uniting all of Germany. And it starts a series of wars that allow for the unification of all the German people. The first is something called the Dano-Prussian War. Then they fight against the Austrian-Hungary Empire, which is a successor to the Holy Roman Empire, and they defeat the Austrians really quickly. Then they move on to France, which is the dominant power of this time, and they defeat France, thus allowing for the complete unification of Germany under Prussian leadership. Okay, so how was Prussia able to be so successful? Well, as we discussed last class, There are certain characteristics about these city states that go on to unify a nation. And the three major ones that Moscow and Prussia share is open, cooperative competition. They're surrounded by enemies and they're forced to be innovative, open, and tolerant in order to succeed. They're forced to be unified, advantaged by disadvantage. So Prussia and Moscow have limited resources, which forces them to focus on human capital, I'm making sure the citizens were well educated and the citizens were hardworking and vacillate. So again, Moscow was under the vacillate of the mongos and Prussia for the longest time was under the vacillate of the Swedes, the Poles, the Lutheranians. And as a result, they're always engaged in the process of reflection and resilience. And that's really the secret to the success of Prussia. All right, at the same time, the thing to remember about the Prussians that differentiates them from the Moscovites is because Prussia is situated within Europe, it has a very different attitude towards humans than the Moscovites. The Moscovites, because of their Mongolian heritage, they tend to oppress their subjects, whereas the Prussians are much more democratic, They're much more progressive, they're much more open. Okay? So this is Frederick the Great, who is considered the great nation builder of pressure for his military victories. What is often ignored is his social, economic, political reforms. He really is the first enlightenment despot. Okay, he's heavily influenced by Emmanuel Quod. They fought very highly of each other. And he was very intent on making pressure the first enlightened state of Europe. Okay, so let's look at the few things he did. He radically reformed the Persian judicial system so that you had rule of law, so that everyone had recourse to justice. Even if you were poor, you could still sue. He abolished torture in the military. And this was revolutionary at this time because you always assumed that you kept your soldiers in check by scaring them. Okay? He established religious tolerance. Remember at this time in Europe, there's a huge war going on between Catholics and the Protestants, and he was tolerant towards both the Catholics and the Protestants, and even to a certain extent to the Jews as well. Okay? And over time, Kahnisberg, which is the heart and center of the Persian nation, becomes really one, it has one of the largest Jewish settlements in Europe. about 5,000 at that point. He grants basic form of freedom of speech. And the most important thing is that in 1763, he establishes a public school system that becomes a source for precious future greatness. And to put this in context, it's only over 100 years later when Britain and France does this. Japan and America will copy, especially, to instill the Prussian education system. Okay? In 1806, Prussia is defeated by Napoleon. Okay, we discussed this. And as a result, Prussia becomes a vassal state to Napoleon. And at this point, what the Prussians do is what they've always done, which is engage in the deep process of reflection. And they decide that in order to defeat France, they must be like France. Remember, this is the French Revolution there's a spread of liberalism throughout France because of the revolution. So the Prussians decided to copy the most important reforms of the French Revolution, which include the abostment of serfdom. Now peasants can become landowners. They destroy monopolies to encourage free market competition. They open a civil service to the no-class before it's only available to the nobility. And the most important thing is the reforms of a man named William von Humboldt. He creates the modern research university. So he founded something called the Berlin University. And so he conceptualized the research university where before you sat in class and you listened to lectures and you memorized what the professor told you, but now you're encouraged to do your own research to write a thesis, which is what we do today. The most important reform he did was to conceptualize public education as a meritocracy. It's an opportunity for the middle class to grow, okay? To grow the middle class and to give the middle class a greater academic role in society. And these reforms in only a few years will allow Prussia to defeat Napoleon and establish itself as a great power again. This is Karl von Kloswitz. And he's considered the greatest military strategist of all time. He's Prussian. He was an officer in the Prussian military. And he fought very deeply about the wars of Napoleon. Why is it that Napoleon and the French were so great? And his conclusion is because they were able to mobilize the resources of society for total war. Okay, and his conclusion is that in the future, as a nation, if you want to win militarily, then you must engage your citizens, okay? You must increase the morale of your citizens. You must make them want to die for your nation, all right? 1848 is one of the most important years in human history. And the reason why is in 1848, okay, these red spots, these were all revolutionary hotspots, okay? So after Napoleon was defeated in 1815, The European powers led by Merneneck of the Austrian-Hungary Empire, he sits everyone down and decides, first of all, how to ensure no wars like that of Napoleon arise again in Europe, how to create peace, but also, most importantly, how to maintain the feudal structure of Europe. Okay, and he and they were very successful at that until 1848 when the middle class when the workers rebelled in 17 different places you will notice that in England in Britain there was no revolution There were no rebellions and the reason why is Because Britain at this point had colonies overseas right Canada New Zealand Australia And so these people who were upset about the economic status in Britain could migrate elsewhere. But these other places didn't have any qualities. There was no pressure valve for social discontent, and so these revolutions started to take place. A lot of these revolutions were suppressed violently. And you would think that pressure, because it is a military dictatorship, it would suppress the middle class liberals violently. But that's not what happened. Let's see what happened. So this is from Wikipedia. What happened was that there were public demonstrations because people wanted more political reforms. And the army killed certain people. And now people are really, really angry. So they're getting ready for civil war. This is another French Revolution. And at this point, the emperor, Frederick William, what he does is he goes and reassures the public that they will negotiate a peace. And what he does to calm the public is the king also approved arming the citizens. He gives guns to the citizens to ensure that the citizens will feel safe negotiating with the army. But not only that. But when the crowds of people went to the king, the king basically agreed to all their demands, including parliamentary elections, a constitution, and freedom of press. Also, he promised everyone that pressure was to emerge forthwith into Germany. Because not only is there liberal socialist sentiments at this point, there's also nationalist sentiments. People want to feel united as a German people, okay? And then what calms people down is the king attends a funeral for those citizens who died during the rebellion. Okay? And they wore, okay, he and his ministers wore the revolutionary tricolor black, red, and gold, which is by the way the flag of Germany right now. Okay? So he's showing tremendous respect to his people. Okay? And that's his oppression attitude. Again, the historical image of Prussians is very stern, very austere, very dictatorial. Okay? But if you look at their behavior, they're very respectful of the people because they understand that in this world, we're surrounded by enemies. There is such a power with France, Russia, all around them. They need to stay united as a people. Okay? This is Otto von Bismarck, the most famous question in world history. He is the founder of something called the Second Reich, the Holy Roman Empire was the first Reich, and the unified Germany is the Second Reich. So he's really the founder of modern day Germany. He's known as the iron chancellor because he gave a speech in which he said that the precision of pressure in Germany will not be determined by its liberalism, by its power. Okay, so he's rejecting the idea of liberalism, of free speech, of openness, of negotiation, of institutions, and he's focusing on the military. Pressure must constrain its strength and hold it for the favorable moment, which has already come in God several times. Since the treaties of Vienna, our frontiers have been ill-designed for a healthy body politic. Now free speeches and majority decisions were the great questions of the day we decided. That was a great mistake of 1848 and 1849, but by iron and blood for violence and sacrifice. So when you read the speech, you understand that he's reputating the liberalism of King Frederick Wilhelm. He's saying that, nope, the armies have gone in and killed all the demonstrators. So that's what he's saying, and that's why he has a reputation for being the iron chancellor, a man of violence, a man of sternness. But he was extremely problematic man, And his ambition was to have a unified Germany in which people were content. Okay? And so this is another speech he made. Same man, but completely different tone. And so he says, the real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence. He is not sure that he will always have work. He is not sure that he will always be healthy. and he perceives that he will one day be old and then fit to work. Okay? So he's simplifying with the plight of the factory worker. He understands that it's wrong for workers to lose their hand at work and not be compensated. It's wrong for workers to get sick and their entire family to go into poverty. It's wrong for kids who are six years old to go to factories to work. It's wrong for managers to beat the crap out of other factory workers. So what they will do is institute the first welfare state, the first socialist state in the world. Look at this. They have health insurance. They have accident insurance. So if you get injured at work, then the state will come in and give you money. They have a pension. They protect workers from abuse. They have Children Protection Act, which means children are not allowed to go work in factories. So in other words, in the year 1800 to 1900, if you could be a citizen of anywhere in the world, you would definitely want to be a citizen of Germany. At this point, in Britain, in France, in America, workers are being exploited everywhere. But in Germany, workers are being given rights. And because they're being given rights, they want to fight for the country. They want to die for the country. And this makes Germany the most powerful nation in the world at this time, okay? And when that happens, in Europe, when you become a hegemon, guess who gets scared at you? Guess who's now going to plot to get rid of you? Britain, right? All right, so at the same time, I don't want to say that Germany is a liberal democracy at this point. It's not. Why? Because as these industrial reforms are happening, there are more groups that are discontent. And they pose a problem to German unity. And these groups are obviously the Catholics. A third of Germany now is Catholic because pressure has united all of Germany. the longest time the Holy Roman Empire was Catholic. So a third of all the people is Catholic. Bismarck, his biggest failure, his biggest mistake was his attempt to suppress the Catholics. Okay? He basically said, listen, we're not gonna fund you anymore and if you insist on suing loyalty to the Pope, then we'll put you in prison. You're not to swear loyalty to Germany. And so the priests all went to prison. Okay? And this was a disaster for Bismarck and ultimately he had to compromise and relent. So the Catholics are a huge problem. Then you have the liberals. So you may have heard the term liberalism, socialism, communism. There's a huge difference between these three terms, guys. So let me explain what the differences are. Liberalism means more political rights for the middle class, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, voting power. Why? Because the middle class have economic power and they want to transform that into political power. The socialists want democracy for all. They understand that for democracy to really happen, you need to provide worker protection. You need to create class consciousness. You need to let workers have unions. So that's socialism. And you have communism, which is more radical. Basically, communists believe wealth should be redistributed, which you get rid of private property and redistribute wealth for more equality in society. Also, communism is an international movement. Okay? You also have Polish nationalists. A lot of people in Germany at this time are Poles. They're Slavic people who have their own language, have their own ethnic identity. And ultimately, they will form Poland, okay? And at this time, they're a huge problem for the German state, and they are suppressed as well. They have people called the Anarchists. The Anarchists are people who believe that We don't need government. We don't need authority. People should just be allowed to do what they want to do. People are self-organizing, and as a result, government is bad. So, they have all these different political groups, and they're all very powerful, and they all pose a problem to German unity. And as a result, they are persecuted one by one. This is important because at the end of World War I, when Germany has surrendered, they will reflect on why they lost. And one conclusion that they had was because of all these political divisions, okay? There are too many divisions within society. Therefore, we need to suppress this division and create one political entity. And this is what allows for the rise, of course, of Hitler and the Nazis. Okay? So this is important to understand. All right. World War I, again, when Germany is too powerful, Britain is forced into action. Britain cannot allow for Hezharmon to be dominant in Europe. Britain went into action against Napoleon when Napoleon was Hezharmon. Now they're going into action against Germany because Germany is too powerful. And World War I, no one expected this, but World War I was a catastrophe. Millions of people died. And it was in the lines of Britain, France, and Russia. Basically against Germany. Germany did have the Ottoman Empire and the Austria-Hungary Empire as allies, but they were not effective. It was really Germany versus the world. And what's amazing is Germany was able to create a stalemate or even – actually, sometimes when Germany was about to win, okay? And of course, when that happens, if Germany is going to win this war, it forces the Americans into action. Okay? Why? Well, first of all, the Americans think like the British. The Americans and British do not want a European powder merch to unite the heartland, to unite Asia and Europe, because then it negates naval trade. Does that make sense? Second reason is the Americans actually lend a lot of money to the British, something called a land lease policy. So if Britain lost the war, then all that money is gone. So America comes in to save Britain. But even at this point, Germany, it was not clear Germany was going to lose the Russia was not of a war, France was divided, Britain was not that effectual. So it's not clear at this point, Germany was going to lose. Chancellor of the Army was going to lose, but Germany had not lost yet. And if Germany could mobilize all its resources, then Germany could withstand this onslaught. But then something happened that was very important that changed the mind, the calculus of these German generals. the 1917 Russian Revolution. Why did the revolution happen? Because Tsar Nicholas was too focused on the war and he neglected the political divisions at home, and this allowed for a revolution to happen. So the German generals, or control during that point, they're scared to death of what's happening in Germany. Because remember, at this point in history, the nation with the strongest working class, the Poleterid, is actually Germany, not Russia. So as a result, this man's name is Paul von Hinderberg. He's very important. He's now head of the German military, as well as head of the German nation. And he forced the German government to surrender to the Allies. And this led to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles had many stipulations that were unfair to the Germans. So the Germans had to pay a lot of debt. They had, they could not longer rearm. They had to reduce the military. They lost a lot of land to France, okay? But the worst thing that the Allies did in this negotiation was it forced Germany to omit complete guilt for starting the war. That was completely unfair, okay? This war happened for many reasons. Everyone was involved. Everyone had a certain blame. but Germany had to take all the blame. Okay, and as a result, the government did not want to sign this treaty because obviously this is going to piss off all your people, but the army forced the government to sign the treaty, okay? And the thinking of the army at this point is, listen, we've been in this situation before, okay? We lost Napoleon, right? And so we just paid off a lot of debt to Napoleon, and then we built. And then when we built, we made the nation stronger. We're resilient. So we'll do the same thing here. We'll just surrender, accept all the terms, then we'll start to rebuild and unify the nation and take revenge against everyone. And that was the thinking of the military. Very simple strategy, right? The War Memorial Republic is what follows after the war. And the War Memorial Republic is 10 years of hyperinflation, social discontent, complete chaos. And when a nation suffers economically, politically, culturally, what it often does is it engages in a deep process of reflection. It goes back into the past and thinks about how to rebuild itself. So some philosophers that are very important for thinkers of how to unify Germany are like Arthur Schrobenheimer. Arthur Schrobenheimer is a very, very important philosopher. His conception of the world is that the underlying force of the world is the will, desire. And the will manifests itself physically in us, in bodies. You understand the idea, okay? So the underlying force of the universe is the will, desire, and then the will will physically manifest itself in our bodies. And then our bodies will seek to do what the will wants, which is to procreate, right? To have sex, to have children, to eat food, okay? Now the great, the great, the paradox of this situation is before the manifestation in our bodies, the will was just one, right? There was no differentiation. But once the will manifests itself in our bodies, there's now differentiation, okay? There's multiplicity, and as such, we see the world for our own perspective, for our own self-respective, which leads to conflict. You understand? It is because we've forgotten that we are just one that leads to conflict and suffering, okay? So his great solution to this is compassion. As humans, we must first and foremost be compassionate towards each other and remind ourselves that we are just one people. And we can do that through the appreciation of art because art is a great unifier, right? Art is the thing that allows us to contemplate the wholeness and the harmony of the world. And then he says that there are some of us who should engage in self-denial, who should become like mucks, Who should deny the world? Because the world is inherently evil. So when you refuse to have children, when you refuse to struggle, to suffer, then you achieve enlightenment. And this is easy for us to understand, because this is a very Buddhist ideology. So he's basically taking Buddhism and Hinduism from India, and he's making it more secular. He's trying to remove the religious aspects of it and make it into a logical system. Does that make sense? Alright, so he says, life has no intrinsic worth but is kept in motion merely by desire and illusion. And as such, if you can remove the desire from your life, you achieve nirvana, you achieve enlightenment, okay? This is a really important passage, okay? Music is thus by no means like the other arts. The copy of the ideas but the copy of the will itself, whose objectivity the ideas are. This is why the effect of music is so much more powerful and penetrating than that of the other arts. For they speak only of shadows, but it speaks of the thing itself. This is really important. So how do we know the will? How can we access the will? It's through music, okay? Because the music is the perfect encapsulation of desire. It is the perfect expression of emotions. And so through music, we can rediscover the unity of the world. the unity of the will. And why is this important? Because it inspires Richard Wagner. Richard Wagner is the most famous musician in Germany. He's really the national poet of Germany. He's a genius. And his great insight is that all art can be combined into one. And this is before movies, right? This is before cinema. So you can put in music, paintings, theater, poetry, philosophy, everything together to create one total art that will inspire and unite the people. And this is why he spends 30 years to create something called the Ring Trilogy. OK? And this is held every year at the Bay Roof Festival. He creates his own opera house in order to stage a play. And it's 15 hours, OK? It's four parts, 15 hours. And it's the inspiration for the Lord of the Rings movies. I'm sure you've seen Lord of the Rings, right? It's a very similar plot. And the plot, very simple. It's 15 hours. Sorry, it's not a simple plot, but I'll put it in very simple terms. It's 15 hours, four parts. So there are people called the Rhine Maidens. These are river goddesses who control the river Rhine. And they have a lot of gold. There's a dwarf, an evil dwarf, who steals all this gold. And with all this gold, he crafts a ring to control the world, to rule the world. And this is important because it's actually taking Schopenheimer's philosophy, desires a source of evil in the world, and turn it into a metaphor. The ring is desire. The ring is what represents evil and suffering in the world. And because we all seek the ring, we cause misery. OK, so this is how it starts. Now up in the sky, there's a god named Wotun. Okay? So Wotun is using a lot of Norse mythology that we learned before from the Vikings, right? Wotun is another name for Odin. And Wotun and the gods want to create a palace for themselves called Vahala. And they hire a giant to build this Vahala. Okay? And they set a contract with him. But the giants want payment first. Okay? So, Walden and the gods steal this ring from the dwarf, okay? And they give it to the giant. But then the dwarf places a curse on this ring. And the curse is that the gods will see their end, the end of days, Wagnorok, every day, okay? So the gods are haunted. And so, the gods are like, we need to destroy this ring. Otherwise, we're always gonna be haunted. We won't be able to sleep. And so they need to kill the giant and get the ring back. But they have a contract with this giant. So Odin, a war turn, conspires to give birth to a great hero, who's half human, half god, but he's not fully god, who will now go kill the giant and get the ring back. That's his great idea. So he gives birth to twins, Siglingde and Sigmund. They're separated at birth, they're twins, and then they're running into each other and they fall in love with each other. Remember, they're twins, okay? Celinde is already married, and so Sigmund is determined to kill her husband, Hunde, and marry Celinde, okay? And this is all part of Wotan's plan. He's really happy. But then his wife, Frick, says to him, no, no, no, no, no. They broken the incest law, okay? They're not allowed to have incest with each other. And so you have to kill Sigmund. And Wharton doesn't have a choice no matter. He has to agree to the death of Sigmund. So he sends his daughter, a vakri named Burhindi, to go make sure that Sigmund is killed against Hundin. But Burhindi, when she arrives, she sees the love between Sigmund and Sigmund So, I see Helmdei and Sigmund and she wants to save Sigmund and defy Wharton's orders. Wharton hears about this and punishes Brunhilde and kills Sigmund, okay? And what he does by punishing Brunhilde is he sentences her to eternal sleep surrounded by a wall of flames. Only the greatest hero in the world, the hero who is capable of killing a giant and retrieving the ring can save her. And this hero is named Siegfried, who's a son of Siegman. Okay, this is Act Three now. Siegman saves her, kills the giant, and now has retrieved the ring. But because he has a ring now, everyone around him is now conspiring to kill him and get the ring for themselves, okay? The problem of desire, which causes misery. So in the end what happens is that Siegfried is killed, Brahindi learns of this treachery and then she kills those who killed him. And then what she does is she sacrifice herself in the flames and throws the ring back to the river maidens, okay? And then what happens, and this is the ending, is the river maidens destroy the ring. But when they destroy the ring, They destroy everything. They destroy Vahalla as well. The gods are destroyed. Vahalla is destroyed. The entire world is destroyed. And this goes back to the Schopenhauer idea that the source of the world is the desire. When you destroy the desire, you destroy the world. But when you do that, you allow for a new beginning. So that's the national epic of Germany, the ring cycle. And again, this is put on every year at Beirut. It's four nights and it's 15 hours in total. There are some theaters that put on 15 hours straight. And the Germans love this. So I'm gonna play for you some music from this opera. And this is the most famous part called the Ride of the Vakarites. As you can see, it's very powerful. It represents the unity of the will. So as people are watching this, they become united as one. Time, space collapse, past, present collapse. This is meant to depict the will, the unity of the will. Okay, that's it. Great. Let's move on. Okay, so building on top of Wagner and Schopenheimer is Frederick Nietzsche, who is considered one of the greatest German philosophers of all time, okay? And he makes some corrections to the philosophy of Schopenheimer and the music of Wagner. Here are the three major differences between Schopenheimer and Nietzsche. You can see that Schopenheimer, he's a pessimistic playdough. Whereas Nietzsche, he's an optimistic Aristotle. So Nietzsche's main complaint is this. OK, Schopenheimer's conception is the source of everything is desire. And from desire, desire will manifest itself in physical bodies in order to obtain what it wants. And that's true. That makes sense. And then, Sharpanah's solution is that we must deny this desire. We must negate this desire, and then we will bring peace to the world. So for Nietzsche, this is confusing because, wait a minute here, the desire that will manifest itself in physical bodies, why would it do that? What's the logic of that? and sharp on numbers say, well, because God is evil, because God wants us to suffer. And then Nietzsche is like, okay, first of all, if God is evil, what's the point of resisting him? Right? If it brings us enjoyment to seek desire, then what's wrong with it? Is it possible that God is good and that God lets desire benefits itself in us in order for us to pursue our desire. Okay? So this is one of the major differences. For Schopenheimer, we are just biological beings that have a will to life. We want to procreate. But for Nietzsche, it's the will to power. Okay? This is a very famous phrase from Nietzsche. The will to power. The will to expand ourselves. Okay? The will to achieve our fullest desires. Okay? Not just to procreate but to impose our will on reality itself. That's the true purpose of life. That's why God created us, to become gods ourselves. Because otherwise, this makes no sense. How do we go from desire to bodies? It only makes sense if the bodies can amplify our desire and help us achieve our desire. Okay? The will to power is a really important concept. Schopenhauer believes that multiplicity is conflict. The fact that this will benefit itself and our bodies can only lead to conflict because we're all fighting for scarce resources. For example, the ability to procreate, okay? But for Nietzsche, multiplicity is creativity. It's because there's conflict that you have action and action leads to innovation. And innovation by itself is progress, okay? And so for Schopenheimer, the ideal person, the Superman is the compassionate monk, the person who feels sympathy for the world and as such engages in a process of self denial, self negation. He refuses to procreate, he refuses to struggle, he refuses to eat, okay? The monk. But for Nietzsche, the ideal is the ubermunch, the ubermunch. The ubermunch is hard to translate. We usually translate it as Superman, but you can also translate it as over man. The person above humanity, the person above history. So the paragon, the example that Nietzsche uses is Napoleon, right? Who is Napoleon? Napoleon is an individual who can step outside of history to control history, to manipulate history. That's what the ubermens is. We ourselves are controlled by social forces, right? We don't want to piss off our classmates. We want to please our teachers and our parents. So therefore, we are slaves to public opinion. But Nietzsche says, to be an ubermensch, you have to ignore public opinion. You have to ignore community consensus and just focus on what is right to you. To look deep into yourself and figure out what is right for you and only you. Okay, that's the ubermensch. And for him, the ideal example, of course, is Napoleon. And why is this important? Because these ideas, in the context of the Weimar Republic, will lead to the rise of the Nazis and Hitler. Because Hitler is promising himself to be the next Napoleon. That's Hitler's promise to the German people. I will be your Napoleon. I will unite you. I will lead you to victory against all enemies. Does that make sense, guys? Are you guys following this? All right, so let's look at a couple of passages from Nietzsche, okay? Nietzsche is a very brilliant philosopher, so he's very complicated, he's very complex, and he can at times be very contradictory, okay? All right, so let's read a passage from the Geology of Morals, which is his most famous book. We can no longer conceal from ourselves precisely what this will, under the direction of the aesthetic ideal expressors, which is hatred of anything human, animal or material, a porence of the senses of reason itself, fear of happiness and beauty, that the desire to escape from all illusion, change, growth, death, wishing even from the desire itself, all this means let us have the courage to confront it, a wish for oblivion, and aversion to life, a reputation, reputation of everything vital to existence, but it is and remains a will. And to say at the end that which I said at the beginning, men will desire oblivion rather than that desire at all. We are desire, okay? It's really a question of how we manifest our desire. In today's society, in the Christian, Buddhist world view, it's important to negate our desire. But when we negate our desire, we negate what our desire could lead us to, which is truth and beauty, and creativity and progress and innovation, okay? And when we negate ourselves, we're not returning back to unity, We are only embracing oblivion. That's a problem with Christianity. It's all, it's turning us into slaves. That's a problem with modernity. That's a problem with society. We are all being forced to become slaves. Okay? Does that make sense? All right, let's go on. To call the tame animal improving it sounds to ears almost like a joke. He who knows what goes on in menageries doubts very much whether an animal is improved in such places. It is certainly weakened, it is made less dangerous, and by means of the depressing influence of fear, pain, wounds, and hunger, it is converted into a sick animal, and the same holds good of the tame man whom the priest has improved. This is a great metaphor. How can we understand the impact of society on people? Well, society is a zoo, okay? We're all cage animals. Think about it, okay? What is school then? School is a zoo, okay? Before you were allowed to run around and explore the world and learn things for yourself, right? And as such, you mastered the world around you. You could hunt, you could farm, you could kill people, you could build alliances, you could write plays. But in school, what do we ask you to do? We ask you to come to school, we ask you to come to class on time, take notes, take tests, and then we give you a piece of paper, right? We turn you into cage animals. So you lose the capacity to think for yourself, right? That's what school is. So there's nothing wrong with what Nietzsche is saying. This is an abundant metaphor to capture the essence of modernity. Society, education, it's all meant to degrade your capacity to think for yourself in order to make you more obedient to power. All right, so if you take Schrobenheimer, Wagner, and Nietzsche together and combine them, What you get is a rejection of Christianity and return to paganism. Okay? So let's look at the differences. In the Christian worldview, there is a God. If there's a God, there is a framework of good and evil. So you must do good and you must avoid evil. But in the pagan worldview, there is no God. There's many gods, but the gods themselves have no power over fate. And as a result, it is up to you to define good and evil. It's up to you to act and to find meaning in the world. Okay, so going back to school, the metaphor, right? Today we have grades and therefore you're focused on getting grades. But if we have no grades, we have no teachers, then you have to go learn for yourself. You would have to go throughout your own education. What's amazing about this idea is you would want to because Nietzsche says we are first and foremost desire, we desire to grow. So if we let you alone and said, no grades, no school, no test. It does not mean that you will stop learning. It just means that you will learn what you want to learn. Okay? Alright, second difference. Christianity demands faith, obedience to God. Paganism demands action. Okay? You seek meaning for yourself through action. The last difference is Christianity focused on individual free will. Okay? Which just means you are free to obey the powerful. But in the pagan mindset, it's about unity of will. If we want to act, we can only do so by working together. We will find a leader to lead us, but the leader only represents the unity of will. Does that make sense? So during the Wabang Republic, with the rise of Nazism, you now have a rejection of Christianity and return to paganism as a solution to the natural humiliation of Germany. And this is what leads to the rise of Adolf Hitler. This man is Paul von Hinderberg, the same man who ordered the surrender of Germany. In 1933, he is president of Germany, the leader. And he appoints Adolf Hitler, the chancellor of Germany. The question then is, why would he do that? Yeah, I mean, why would the head of the army, the head nation make Adolf Hitler chancellor. And the reason is this. Adolf Hitler was a German spy. He was a German, sorry, sorry, he was a spy for the German army. Okay? This is really important. Let me explain this. This is from Wikipedia, guys, okay? So I'm not making this up. It says very clearly, as an intelligence agent of the army, Hitler's job was to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party, the Nazi Party, National Socialists. Okay, so what is this happening? So remember the German Army surrendered because they were afraid of revolution back at home. Who was leading the revolution? The extreme left and extreme right. Okay, what's the difference between extreme left and extreme right? Both are populists. They all believe in workers' rights. The left believe in international solidarity. Okay, specifically with Russia, the Soviet Union, and other workers in the world. The right are nationalist. They believe in German unity. Okay? So the army is like, okay, right now the most powerful group in Germany are the socialists, right? The left. We need to support the right. So Hitler goes into the Nazi Party, the German Workers' Party, and he helps to finance it. Okay? Hitler is giving money to these guys. And because he's such a charismatic speaker, he eventually becomes their leader. But there's point in history, okay, this is really important. This is a really small group of people. They're extreme, they're violent, but they are a minority. The majority of the socialists, okay? This is something that you're not taught in school, but this is very important to remember. It is the army that finances the building of the Nazi Party in order to gap in the influence of the socialists. Okay, because remember, the army now is still dedicated to to avenging the national humiliation of World War I. All right, so this is Carol Quigley, and he wrote a long book called Tradgeted in Hope. And he explains in, oh sorry, Carol Quigley, he was a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He was Brooklyn's teacher. He was Brooklyn's teacher, and he's a widely respected scholar. And in his book he explains how Hitler was able to rise and take over the leadership of Germany. He explains at this point in history that Germany is threatened by two opposing forces. The first force, of course, is communism. The Soviet Union, that's a huge menace to Germany. But another menace that's actually even more menacing is capitalism. Because at this point in history, what's happening is the international capitalist are trying to create a central banking system in order to control the entire global economy. He writes about this. This is the 1920s. The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim. Nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and economy of the world as a whole. This is really important to understand. 1920s, all these bankers in the world, America, Britain, France, Germany, they're getting together and they're conspiring how to create a global financial system that can control the world and create a feudal system. Right? And guess what guys? You don't know this but they succeeded. The system we have today is the one they created. Okay? But I will explain this later on in the course. Okay? But this is something that the Germans, nationalists like Hitler, didn't want. Okay? So, Hitler, he's allowed to rise and the Nazi party is becoming more and more popular. But again, even though they are popular, the Nazi popularists are socialist. So what happens now is the army and the Nazi party get together and assume power. So the first step for Hitler, in order to assume power, is something called the Dite of the Long Knives. This is really important because the Nazi party is an extreme right wing workers party. So the army orders Hitler to kill all their leaders. And that's what happened. This is called the night of the brown shirts. The extreme right wing was eliminated by the army. And the Nazi party and now the army, sorry, so now the Nazi party and the army are now symbiotic, okay? They rely on each other. From now on, the Nazi party will ensure total unity of will at home through suppression of people, okay? And the army will now go march and conquer the world. Doesn't make sense, guys. That's a plan. All right, so, Adolf Hitler is the perfect man for the job assigned to him by the army, because he's a fantastic speaker. Okay, he's very charismatic. We're gonna listen to his voice, so you can appreciate how powerful his speech is, his voices. For the right, if you believe that I was right, that I worked hard, that I didn't use this year for you, that I used my time in the service of the people, they will now have a shield. If yes, then I will fight for you, as I will fight for you. What his speeches do, is they create a unit of will in Germany. Again, the goal is to re-germanize the nation and reunite the German people. The unit of will creates the idea of synchronicity. Remember, synchronicity is a secret to modern warfare. Synchronosity means the organization and mobilization of your people into one task. And this is represented by the picture. If you have people to stand in line for a long time, you can fight a war, okay? And the people and the nations that are really strong at synchronosity, of course, are Germany and Japan, right? Go to Germany, go on the subway, go to Japan, go on the subway. No one is struggling against each other, okay? No one's pushing everyone, even though it's crowded, People are standing exactly where they should be standing perfectly. That is the idea of synchronicity. If your people can do that, they can fight a war and win the war. So this idea of unitive will, they can stand in line for a long, long time. All right, so we're going to look at some speeches from Hitler. And we can see from his speeches, he's trying to create unitive will. He's trying to be the Umar Muttz, the Superman, who will unite his people like Napoleon and carry them to victory through faith in themselves. The unit of will. If man wished to live, then they are forced to kill others. The entire struggle for survival is a conquest of a means of existence which in turn results in elimination of others from the same sources of subsidence. As long as there are peoples on this earth, there will be nations against nations and they will be forced to protect their vital rights in the same way as the individual is forced to protect his rights. One is either the hammer or the anvil. We confess that it is our purpose to prepare the German people, again for the role of the hammer, okay? So he's saying we must unite as a people. We must have unity of will if we are to triumph against our enemies. All right, nothing is possible unless one will commands. A will which has to be obeyed by others, beginning at the top and ending only at the very bottom. This is the expression of an authoritarian state, not of a weak, battling democracy of an authoritarian state where everyone is proud to obey, Because he knows, I will likewise be obeyed when I must take command. Hitler is not being a dictator. He is trying to create union of will. He is the leader, he's the uberman, but that's only because God demanded him to be so. He will unite the German people into a hurricane, into an ocean to crash itself upon the world. In the course of my life, I have very often been a prophet and I have usually been ridiculed for it. During the time of my struggle for power, it was in the first instance that Jewish race which only received my prophecies with laughter when I said that I would one day take over the leadership of the state. And with it, that of the whole nation, and that I would then among many other things settle the Jewish problem. Their laughter was a worryus, but I think that for some time now they have been laughing on the other side of their face. Today I will once more be a prophet. The international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolstering of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. So we don't actually have any concrete evidence for the Holocaust. So one piece of evidence for the Holocaust is this speech by Hitler. But I want to explain what he is saying here. What he's saying is, we the German nation want to be left alone. We want to be united. We want to be unified. But the capitalist and the commoners all seek to undermine us. And who are the commoners? And who are the capitalists? The Jews, okay? It's the Jews who are metaphor for a national, elicable individuals who are conspiring to undermine the vitality and the strength of the germination. All right, so that's what he's saying here. All right, 1939, September 1st is the beginning of World War II, okay? And so he's gonna explain why this is happening. As a nationalist socialist and as a German soldier, I end up on the struggle of a stored heart. My whole life has been nothing but one struggle for my people, for its restoration and for Germany. There was only one watchword for that struggle favored in this people, one word I never learned, that is surrender, okay? So he's telling the people, we're gonna fight this war again. Why did we lose World War I? Because we didn't have faith. We surrendered. If we all came together and we fought to the very best end, we would have prevailed against our enemies. It is quite unimportant whether we ourselves live, but it's essential that our people shall live, that Germany shall live. The sacrifice that is amended of us is not greater than the sacrifice that many generations have made. If we form a community closely bound together by vows, ready for anything, resolve never to surrender, and our will will master every hardship and difficulty. It is the unity of will that matters. All right, 1942, number eight, it's basically at a time in history when the Germans understand they've lost the war. The Americans are now in the war. The Americans are getting ready to invade Europe. The German invasion of the Soviet Union has failed. They're bogged down in the Soviet Union. Germany is overstretched. The entire world has allied itself against Germany, okay? So the war is about to be lost. But let's look at what Hitler has to say. It is with the same conviction that I now stand before you and has never left me, either since the day on which, as an unknown man in the city, I began to struggle first for the soul of the German people and then on beyond the city for more and more followers. In the beginning, I did not have much more to give than faith, the faith that if anyone pursues a just aim, I will be unchanging and understrip loyalty and never let himself be diverted from it, but puts everything into it, then others will be found who are determined to be his followers, and that from this holds in ever stronger faith, much gradually radiated to the whole people. Okay, so this is unity of will. We reject reality. Reality does not matter, because we impose our will on reality. As long as we have faith, as long as we have unity of will, we will triumph. Okay, all right. So let's go back to the beginning. We were talking about Kalaenagrad, right? It is one of the greatest injustices in human history that Connorsburg, which was for the longest time, the cradle of human civilization, the epicenter of enlightenment, it is now completely destroyed. Okay? But, and this is a really, this is an idea from Wagner, okay? By destroying this, the world has cursed itself. Okay? Let me explain why. First of all, the German question now is more relevant than ever before. You've destroyed Connorsburg, but you have not destroyed the desire for unity among the German people. Okay? So this is the memory that will not fade. Okay? So will the Germans seek vengeance? Will another Hitler arise to unite the German people? Now, what you guys don't know is that the Prussians, one of the main forces opposing Hitler, as well as inhibiting Hitler, because Prussia had a very proud culture and it's very strongest part of Germany. But now that they destroyed Prussia, if another Hitler rises, there's really nothing to stop him. That's the first problem. Second question is, okay, let's go back to this map. Europe and Russia are about to go to war each other, right? Okay, well if you are in Europe and you go into Ukraine, you're gonna be slaughtered, okay? But this is Klennengrad, Russian territory, 500,000 Russians, right? You can blockade Klennengrad, you understand? So this could be the start of World War III right here. Does that make sense to you guys? The Europeans blockade Klennengrad and they start to start to starve the people, put in without no choice but to intervene, okay? But the main problem What is this? Cronusburg was one of the main intellectual, scientific, and cultural centers of Europe. That it's lost, reduced the innovative potential of humanity. All right, so what I will show you in next class when we discuss Kant is science comes from philosophy. Culture leads to philosophy, which leads to science, which leads to technology. You cannot have science independent of philosophy. When you destroy a center of philosophical innovation, We destroy a center for sonic progress. So this is something that we will discuss in depth next class as well. So when we look at Kant, so that is Germany. Any questions about what we've learned so far? Was this clear to you guys? Any questions? To me? Yeah, okay. So where did Hitler come from, right? How did Hitler become so charismatic? Okay, so there's a lot of randomness to life, okay? There's a lot of like randomness going on in life. So the army wanted to inhibit the growth of the socialist left wing movement. And it did so by financing these right wing parties. The Nazi party was just one of many parties that the army financed and supported, okay? Hitler became a spy and he became part of this movement and as such he became he became exposed to a lot of the ideas of the Nazi party. The Nazi party, a lot of the ideas come from Nietzsche and Wagner and others as well, okay? And over time, Hitler came to believe that he was the Messiah. Okay, he was the Messiah dedicated to restoring German unity. And I mean, this is hard to understand, but human population is very diverse, so you always have a subset of people who have these delusions of grandeur. And in the same circumstances, they will be proven right. Okay? That doesn't make sense. So another thing that this is, the army needed someone to play the part of the Ubersmanns, the Superman, who could unite the German people and create national unity so the army could seek its vengeance against the rest of Europe and unite the German people. So they're looking for this role, and then Hitler auditioned for this role, and he got the role, okay? Does that make sense? And this is important because towards the end of the class, we'll discuss Donald Trump. And what I will show you is, This is exactly what happened with Donald Trump. Okay? So the American military needs an Uberman to lead America to war against Putin. And there were different people who auditioned, Biden auditioned, it was terrible, Harris auditioned, it was terrible, and they picked Donald Trump. Okay? So it's a very similar pattern. It's a very similar pattern in human history. You can also argue that Napoleon was the same way. Okay. And what makes these people, um, these people different from us, Napoleon, Hitler, uh, Julius Caesar, Trump is they are the total expression of the Zion will. You understand? They have no compassion, no sympathy for anyone. They believe they are here on a divine mission. They are complete. They are the will itself. And they are, and they must impose their will on others to save the world. Does that make sense? So look at Donald Trump, okay? If you want to show Hitler, look at Donald Trump. The guy's like almost 80. He doesn't sleep, okay? He's off traveling around the world all the time. The guy in his, when he was campaigning, he was giving like three speeches a day, right? He would get up in the morning at four o'clock, fly somewhere, give us two hour speech. People loved him. Then he would get up and fly somewhere else. And he would, he could not stop talking to reporters, okay? He has tremendous energy that comes from the perfect expression of the will. You understand? Donald Trump is all will, all desire, all ego, and no sympathy, no empathy, no compassion. That's Hitler and Napoleon. Yeah, that's a great question. So won't people rebel against us? Won't people think this is reckless? And so what Schopenheimer and Nietzsche and others will say is, what we want first and foremost is to return to unity of will, right? In the very beginning, the will was God. That's a big bang. And then the will expanded itself, right? And so we find ourselves alone in an ocean of alienation. And what our hearts really aspire to is return to a union of will. And so when someone says, you can be part of a movement to transform the world. That's much more appealing to us psychologically then to say, oh, you know what? Come to school, do your homework, get good grades, do the SAT, get into a top 50 American school, become an accountant, and for 50 years, do something meaningless, but make a lot of money, and then you will die a happy person. Like seriously, there's no competition, right? There's no competition. So what I'm saying to Americans, we will make America great again. We will be a civilization, a great civilization again. It will require sacrifice, it will require my sacrifice, but it will be worth it because we will make the world whole again, all right? Okay, so again, when you go back to the Hitler speeches, from our perspective, it's not that persuasive, okay? But when you're in a crowd of people and this man is speaking to you with his voice, it's like Wagner, okay? It's like going to a concert. The music fills you and it inspires your heart. Okay? It makes you want to be the ubermensch. Okay? Hitler is just an example, but he's saying you can also aspire to be the ubermensch if you are willing to sacrifice your life for the unity of will. Okay? So this is really important. This is far more appealing to people than the idea of materialism. This is religion, right? Hitler's turning a new religion. And it's intoxicating, right? I mean like, World War II, I mean, the fact that the Germans were able to fight for so long against the entire world, I mean, it's incredible. I mean, it was America, Britain, France, Soviet Union against the Germans. And the fact that the Germans fought so bravely and fought to the very bitter end, I mean, it just shows you the power of unity of will. Okay? And what this also tells us is these things don't die, okay? You can kill a civilization, you can destroy a city, you can massacre people, but you cannot destroy the desire for unity of will because that's what fundamentally makes us human. Okay? Doesn't make sense. Okay? Great. Any more questions, guys? But that's a great question. Thank you. Does that make sense to you? Okay. Great. Any more questions guys? Okay, so next week we will do Kant, okay? And Kant will lead us to Marx and Freud and modernity."}

We have three more classes. The first class we are doing today is on the nation state. Next Tuesday we will do the Soviet Union. And then the last class next Thursday will be the American Empire. And that will do it for the year. 60 classes, we've covered the entire span of human history. So today we are doing the nation state. Nation-state is composed of two words, nation and state. State is easy to understand. It is just the supreme executive authority sovereign to a territory. The nation is a new idea, and it's the idea of a people of a shared identity, whether it's a language, or a culture, or history, or ethnicity. So for example, the Jews were for the longest time a nation, the state. It was only until the founding of Israel that the Jews had a nation state. Today there are many peoples including the Kurds who are people living in the Middle East. They are a nation but they don't have a state. Okay, and this idea of the nation state it is Probably the most powerful ideology in human history it has led people to Tremendous achievements, but it's also led people to catastrophic wars including World War one and World War two. All right. All right so first thing I want to do is go over where this idea comes from and And in many ways it is the culmination of different religious, economic, and social cultural factors. So let's look at them individually, religion. So as we discussed last class, with the Protestant Reformation there is now a crisis of faith because Christianity creates the idea of the individual. The individual is in direct connection with God. Before, the church would mediate this connection. So you didn't have to worry about God, you just have to worry about the church. If you did what the church told you, you could be promised entry into heaven. The Protestant Reformation removes the Catholic Church from the equation. Now you are in direct communion with God, and you must show absolute faith if you to achieve salvation. And so this creates a crisis of faith because as an individual, how do you know you truly believe in God? You know you love your mothers, but do you love your mother every single day all the time? Probably not, okay? But in religion, you cannot doubt God ever. You can never throw a tent per tentrum at God, or you'll be sent to hell. So it creates this conflict, okay? And historically, there have been different solutions to this problem. So the first solution that we are proposed is the idea of money. Let's replace God with money, right? And that gives us the idea of capitalism. The Calvinists believe this, okay? God is money, money is God. If you accumulate enough wealth, then that shows your absolute faith in God and God's love for you. So that's the idea of money. Then people have said, nope, God is reason. So as long as you pursue reason, as long as you show enlightenment, then that shows your faith in God. And this gives us the idea of the Enlightenment. So Enlightenment, as well as Liberalism. Then others have said, nope, God is the individual itself. Okay, so as long as you believe in yourself, as long as you engage in a process of self-discovery and self-growth, then that will lead you into heaven. And this was most famously proposed And we discussed this last class by Freud and Jung. And this has become the basis for what we call modernism, which is still with us today. And then there's proposed another solution to this problem and it's the idea that God is in the nation. And it turns out that of all these ideas, The most powerful, the most resilient, the most enduring is this idea, that by celebrating your nation, you are celebrating your faith in God. Why? Because the other solutions propose a problem. And the problem it creates is the individual is still isolated from others. It still creates a problem of alienation. And the nation solves this problem, right? Because the nation has to be, by definition, a community of individuals with shared identity. So the nation is the perfect solution because it both solves the problem of religion and it solves the problem of politics and community. In fact, the nation is a conflation of both religion and politics. And that's why historically, it has been the most emotionally, emotionally the most powerful idea. Does that make sense? So from a religious purpose, the nation state solves the problem of faith and alienation. Now let's look at economics. So during this time, you have the industrial revolution. And there are many issues created by the industrial revolution. The first problem is you need to constantly expand, because you need markets and resources, right? So expansion. Another thing is that you need to engage in imperialism. Another problem created by the problem of the industrial revolution is the rise of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. Historically, it was the priests and the warriors who were the elite of society. But now, with the Industrial Revolution, the bourgeoisie, the industrialists and the capitalist, are now the new elite. And as such, they obviously want more political power. But what they really want is property rights. They want to be assured that the wealth they've generated can be protected and inherited by their children and their great-grandchildren. Now the problem is this. The problem is the system of the monarchy cannot really ensure property rights. And the reason why is the king can be overthrown. Their stockings can be overthrown. And this is what happens throughout European history. But the nation state cannot be overthrown. Does that make sense? So the nation state is a solution to the problem of property rights for the bourgeoisie. Also, the nation state has the resources to engage in imperialism. And it has the desire to engage in imperialism. Marlar keys are usually pretty conservative. They like to maintain their position and they will form alliances in order to maintain their position. The nation state is aggressive and expansionist and imperilous, okay? Does that make sense? So in an economic perspective, the nation state solves a problem all created by the Industrial Revolution. Okay, so that's the economic factor. Then let's look at the social cultural factor, social cultural aspect of this. So what's happening because of the industrial revolution is that people are moving from the towns, oh sorry, I said this wrong, they're moving from the villages to the cities. You have this massive process of urbanization. Also because in the industrial revolution, There's more trade. There's not the market. So these goods are proliferating throughout the entire country. And this creates the idea of systemization and standardization. And you have mobility of people, of goods, and of ideas. The mobility of new technology. not just in factories and not just in like steamships, but also in print. And this spreads literacy and information. So think of this as just the beginning of globalization, right? In China, we're in your in your with new ideas all the time because of the internet, because of access to the world. But for people, for most people, this can be frustrating and bewildering. And it creates psychological issues. Primarily the idea of enemy. Enemy just means a loss of sense of cultural rootedness. As things change, you don't know how to adapt to the change. Your values are based on the past. You're not sure if your values can confront the future. Also, alienation. Alienation just means a sense of powerlessness. You lack agency. These changes are happening so fast and so quickly, you don't know if you can control these changes. Also, this enchantment. This enchantment. This enchantment means all these changes are dehumanizing. you're becoming just a caulk and machine. You're becoming no more than a machine. In today's world, AI could possibly be placed as all. So it's creating all this doubt, all this confusion. And the nation state, okay, so there are different solutions to this. There's communism, there's liberalism, and then there's nationalism. And for people, okay, all three ideas are appealing, But communism preaches the idea of international solidarity, which can be for people even more confusing. Liberalism preaches the idea of individual rights. But if you're poor, the right to speak, the right to organize does not really apply to you. And the fact of matters that most people are poor. But nationalism, the fact that we are one group of people in a struggle against other groups of people, This is powerful, okay? This is appealing. Also, if you think about it, nationalism can absorb other ideas, right? You can be both a nationalist and a liberal. And in fact, most people work. You can also be a nationalist and a communist, which was what, so it was a silent proposal, right? And this is what Mao Zedong proposed. So nationalism is the one ideology that can absorb and control all other ideologies. Okay, does that make sense? So for these three particular reasons, religious transformation, economic transformation, and social cultural transformation, the nation state became the best idea of that time and it spread really quickly. All right, so let's talk about widespread. Okay, to understand widespread so quickly, let's talk about game theory. Game theory. So let's imagine, let's do a thought experiment and say there are millions of us playing a game. It doesn't matter what game we're playing. It could be like checkers, it could be chess, it could be monopoly, it could be game of tag, it doesn't matter. But there are millions of us individually playing this game, we're all individual players. The problem is this, the problem is that if maybe a group of us, maybe three or four or five, they decide that they will coordinate, they're gonna play the game together. Maybe because they're family, maybe because they're friends, it doesn't matter why. But the moment they decide to play as a group, This automatically forces everyone else to group together. Okay, and that's the idea of the nation state. The moment that France decided we're a nation state, that forces everyone else, Germany, Russia, Italy to become nation states as well. Because otherwise, you're gonna lose this game, right? The other thing that's really important for us to remember about this theory is this. To win this game now as a nation state, it does not actually matter your size. What matters is your cohesion. How well you're willing to work together to play this game. Or maybe unity of will. So for example, maybe there's a bar fight between four brothers and ten strangers. Well I would bet the four brothers are more likely to win than the ten strangers. The ten strangers don't really know each other, they don't really care. There's not much at stake here. But the four brothers need to protect each other. And they love each other. And so they're gonna fight a lot harder. They're gonna fight to the death. Whereas the 10 strangers, if they feel, they're gonna lose, they're gonna run away. So that's the idea of the nation-state. What determines the strength of the nation-state is unit of will, cohesion. Not size, not wealth, not territory. That's really important to remember. Does that make sense? Okay. So the idea of the nation-state comes from two different sources. The first is the Enlightenment. The second is Romanticism. Okay, so to summarize, to recap, the Enlightenment is this major intellectual trend happening in 17th and 18th, in the 19th century Europe at this time, right? The spread of reason as a God. The spread of science, of literacy, of free thinking, of debate, right? Romanticism is something we didn't really talk that much about, but Romanticism is a direct response to the problems created by the Enlightenment. Because Enlightenment preaches the idea of science, of social forces, of an idea called theism, which is God has set the rules of the game. He's left us, and we're free to play the game. And this creates a lot of anxiety in people. So romantics were a movement to respond to the problems created by enlightenment. So they focused more on nature rather than science. They believed that there is a divine power to nature that we can access by embracing it. They believed in the idea of individual will to change the course of history, that individual, that we are stronger than the historical social forces around us. and they rejected materialism, they were very spiritual. Now the Romanics are a huge movement of people. Have you studied this before? So I don't wanna generalize too much, but the Romanics were a response to the Enlightenment thinkers. From the Enlightenment we have Rousseau. And Rousseau, so I'm sorry, I'm just gonna say it wrong. We saw, remember, a wrote a book called The Social Contract. And in the book he argued that as individuals we are born free with inevitable rights, like the right to life and liberty. We choose to surrender some of these rights in order for more safety and security and wealth possibilities, okay? So the people come together and it creates what's going to call the general will, which is the collective mind of the people. Okay? And from the general will, you will have the government. The government exists in order to serve the general will, which serves the people. Okay? Does that make sense? The government exists in order to protect individual rights of people, to ensure their happiness, to ensure their well-being. This is where Abraham Lincoln gets a famous phrase, all the people by the people for the people. Okay? He is just reiterating the idea of Rousseau. And this of course is implemented by the French Revolution. Napoleon and the French. French, French. And the general will becomes manifest in the nation state. Doesn't make sense. So proposed idea and energy discussed, the French Revolution implements this idea and gives us the first iteration of the nation state. Now this is really successful because what it does is it conceives of a country as a unified whole, almost as a body. This is new in human history because before the monarchy, the monarch, the people and and military were all separate. Okay? In fact, it was very common at the time for monarchs to hire foreign mercenaries to fight their wars. The people weren't really engaged in war. But now that, in the French Revolution, when you can see the nation, the country, as you find a whole, you can now draw on the people to become your soldiers. And in fact, when you do this, you can create almost an infinite supply of soldiers. And because the people believed that they are fighting for themselves, they are more motivated, they are more energetic, they're more willing to sacrifice themselves than for mercenaries who are just in it for the money. And that's why the French Revolution was able to spread throughout Europe and basically conquer Europe, including Spain, Italy, and Germany, okay? But once the French conquered most of Europe, it now stirs resentment against the French because before these were free and independent people who had control over local matters. And now the French were coming and posing a new political, economic, and social regime on them. And there were foreign troops, French troops, to make sure that you had to obey. Okay, so this creates a lot of resentment. And the people's response was to create their own form of nationalism, but in response to French nationalism, okay? So now they're being influenced by romanticism. And in romanticism, their response is this. There is a culture, okay? And it gives us a people, okay? So from the beginning, there are no individuals. There's only a culture. And so it creates a community. And the people, their responsibility is to protect their culture, to enhance the culture, to spread the culture. And the best way to do this is through the nation state. Okay? So this gives us a different interpretation of the nation state. And because the French are now imposing their culture on our indigenous culture, then we have responsibility as a people to rebel and fight back. All right? And this will give us German nationalism. So it's the Germans who first proposed this idea, but then it spreads to Italy as well. So these are two extremely different interpretations of nationalism. In the French interpretation, which is also supported by the Americans in the British, the nation exists to protect individual rights. In the second interpretation, romantic German interpretation the nation said exists in order to protect a culture Okay, because it's culture that gives life to people Okay, what the Germans will say is the culture something that you don't think of it's already in your blood All right, does that make sense? Okay, so That's a general introduction or any questions before I move on to specific examples and evidence Okay, great So we're going to summarize and look at the origins of the nation-state, okay? All right, so really important is to understand the nation-state replaces the monarchy. Okay, and there are three fundamental differences that I want you to remember and emphasize. The first is for the monarchy, the bureaucracy is only authority. Why? Because the bureaucracy is what represents the monarchy, right? But in the nation state, it's the people or the culture. In a monarchy, the elite are the aristocracy, those that have been rewarded by the monarch. But in the nation state, it's usually the bourgeoisie that are the elite, the industrialists, the capitalists. The monarchy, it's pretty flexible because it is really about shifting alliances, right? monarchs, cooperate with other monarchs to maintain the peace and to prevent other monarchs from encroaching on their territory. And as a result, the monarchs tend to be conservative people. They like to weigh things as they are. And they work towards that, okay? So after Franco-Lucian, there was something called the Congress of Vienna in 1815, where the monarchs of Europe basically decided to never fight again. And this was a successful model until 1848, when the people rebelled against them, okay? But the nation state because it is almost like a new religion. It wants centralization and systemization. It wants everyone to buy into the nation state. And as a result, it's expensive. It's either expensive outwards or it's expensive inwards. Does that make sense, guys? Alright, so let's look at some evidence or support for this argument. So this is a really good book called Seeing Like A State by James Scott, published by Yale University Press. Fantastic book, okay? If you are interested in this stuff, I highly recommend you read this book. And it explains how the nation state comes about because of the process of systemization and civilization created by all these social forces happening in Europe at this time, okay? quickly what he wrote. Three factors in the end conspired to make what Kula calls the metrical revolution possible. So the fact that we use the meter that came about during this time. First, the growth of market exchange encouraged uniformity in measures. So capitalism. Second, both popular sentiment and enlightenment philosophy favored a single standard throughout France. Enlightenment. Finally, the revolution and especially in Napoleon, the Napoleonic state building actually enforced the metric system in France and the empire. So just summarizing what we discussed in the first section. And then Scott summarizes, the homogenization of measures then was part of a larger, mandatory simplification. At one stroke, the equality of all French people before the law was guaranteed by the state, they were no longer mere subjects of the Lord and sovereign, but bearers of alienable rights as citizens. So this is just repeating what I said, which is the main purpose of eventual evolution was creating a nation state that guaranteed individual rights. All right, this is Imagine Communities by Benamick Anderson. And again, he goes into why the nation state was born and how it spread. And he explains, what made the new communities imaginable was a half-fortorious, an explosive interaction between a system of production and productive relations, capitalism, technology of communications, print, and the fatality of human linguistic diversity. Okay, so what he means by that is that at Europe at this time, there really is no conception of the idea of a national language. Everyone just spoke what's local to them. There's also no conception of race, okay? We discussed this. Race is a really new concept that was alien to most people, okay? Okay, but now that you have print, you're able to spread language, and you're able to create a national language. And this is key to the nation-state, because print and language allows people to think the same way, and to imagine a shared history. Right? Because culture, it's all just made up. History, it's all just made up. There's something real in it. Okay? And because of this, it's destroyed linguistic diversity. So if you were to go to France in the year 1800, and you go from village to village, they would speak different languages, right? All right. This is too long to read, okay? But I'll just summarize. And what he says is this. Before the advent of the nation state, the elite of Europe, the way they communicate with each other is through inner marriage. Okay? And as a result, there really wasn't like a sense of national identity. But now with the rise of print technology, there's now separation, right? Because you spoke your own language. And this is important because the bourgeoisie are the new elite. And in theory, they would want to move their capital around Europe. They want to move to places where the capital would be more safe, where it would be more productive. But the idea of a national language prevents them from doing that. Does that make sense? Great. All right. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, we talked about. We're just going to read a couple of sentences from his book, The Social Contract. Each of us puts his person and all his power and common under some direction of the general will in our corporate capacity we see each member as an individual part of the whole. But I'm wrong to speak of a Christian Republic. Those two terms are mutually exclusive. Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence. It's spirit is so favorable to tyranny that it always profits by such a regime. Journey Christians are made to be slaves and they know it and don't mind much. This short life counts for too little in their eyes. Okay, so this is the theory of the separation of church and state. This is beginning of the idea of separation of church and state. fundamental ideas of the French Republic. And that's why in today, there's so much antagonism between Islamists and the government. Because the Islamists want to maintain their tradition. They want to wear the hijab. They want to maintain their cultural customs. But the French nation prevents them from doing so in public places and in schools. Okay? So as we discussed, Napoleon will spread French enlightenment principles throughout Europe. In 1805, he defeats both the Russians and the Austrians at the Battle of Austro-Lithes. And at this point, Napoleon should be made Holy Roman Emperor. Okay? He should be made Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire as his tradition. But the Emperor at that time decides you know what rather than give up the throne to Napoleon I'm just going to dissolve this confederation the empire and this was a major blow to to these people okay because the empire in in their minds existed for a thousand years okay ever since Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire is direct here to the Roman Empire okay so for a lot of these intellectuals living in the Holy Roman Empire, this was extremely embarrassing. The Napoleon will create something called the Confederation of the Rhine, which replaces the Holy Roman Empire, and it's basically a Basel state to the French. And this will antagonize a lot of the Germans, because they feel as though their culture, their history, it is being eroded. But at this time, this is really important. The Germans don't have a sense of Germanness. They don't really have a sense of a national identity. So what happened is to counter the French, German intellectuals will attempt to create a new German national identity. This is Ernst's art. He's a poet. And he believes that this new identity should be fashioned like this. Let the enemy of your heart be your church. Let us be one people. Let this nation be our religion. Let hatred of the French be your religion. Let freedom and fatherland be your saints to whom you pray. All right, so he's considered a father of German nationalism because he's pretending this idea that we Germans must exist in opposition to the French. Okay, and this idea is gonna drive a lot of the catastrophes of European history for the next 100 years. This is Johann Fekte. He is a student of Cod. He has a major philosopher in his own right. He's considered a founder of a German idealism school and he explains that, okay, If you want to create a nation state, we have to figure out how to do so. What unites us as a people? And it's not history because we have different histories. And he decides, because he's a huge fan of Shakespeare, that this shared heritage will be one of language. We will speak one language together, and this language, the German language, is what will define our culture and our identity. He writes, description and characterization in such a language is itself a directly vital and centrist matter. So our cultural identity, our guised, will be manifested in our language. So at this time, there's a tremendous explosion of German literature to spread the idea of language. He also explains that the nation state, the nation, it is not just a collection of people. Let's read these passages together because it's really important. Let the component parts of our higher spiritual life be just as dried out and thus let the bands of our national unity also be just as torn apart, lying about in well disorder, scattered and disarrayed as are the bones of the seer. Let them be bleached and dried out by many centuries of storms, the luches and blazing sun. The animating breath of the spiritual world has not yet ceased to blow. It will also take hold of our national bodies in our bones and join them together so that they might gloriously exist in a new and transparent life. So what he's saying is the nation is not a collection of individuals. What the nation is, it's individuals who are transformed together that creates a nation. And the nation will transform everyone. All right, so let's summarize the differences between enlightenment and romanticism because the enlightenment is what's going to drive the French nationalism and nationalism is what's going to drive German nationalism. Okay? It's science versus nature, reason versus emotions, liberty versus will and struggle. Okay? Does that make sense? For our struggle as a people, we can liberate ourselves from a French and we forge ourselves as a great nation. All right. So, the main difference between French nationalism and German nationalism. Okay? Separation of church and state for the Germans, the nation is the church. The French believe in the general will. What's in the best interest of everyone? The Germans believe in the geist, the spirit of your people. Does that make sense? Great. All right, so I'm going to use an example to highlight the difference between the French form of nationalism and the German form of nationalism. It has to do with the Jewish question. There are lots of Jews throughout Europe at this time. There are minorities in these countries. And the question is, with the right to the nation state, what do you do about the Jews? And they're prone because the Jews believe themselves as a nation. They don't have a state, but they're a nation. And the Jews have the Bible, which gives them a shared language, a shared culture, a shared history. So how do you deal with people in your nation that are explicitly not part of your culture. And they're very adamant about not being part of your culture. So the French, okay? There is any symptoms throughout Europe at this time. But the response to animism is different in different nations. In 1894, there's something called the Dreyfus of Fear. And the Dreyfus of Fear is this man, Alfred Dreyfus. He's Jewish by ancestry. But at this time, a lot of elite Jews have already acclimatized, assimilated into the popular culture. And in 1894, he was arrested and accused of being a German spy. Alfred Dreyfus was an officer in the French military. The problem is that French counterintelligence conducted a short investigation and they quickly found out that this man was not the spy. But the French military didn't want to lose face. Also there were a lot of anti-Semitic elements within the French military. So rather than just say, you know what? We got the wrong guy. We were wrong. Let's forget about this. Their response was to put this real spy on trial and acquit him. It's like, no, you know you're innocent, even though the evidence also suggests he's guilty. And we're gonna put dry fists and they put dryfus in prison in a penal colony far away for his entire life, okay? And so news of this leaks, and this creates a national controversy, right? And a man named Elma Zola, who was probably the most famous writer in France at this time, he writes a newspaper article called IACUs, okay? IACUs, the French military of corruption, of incompetence, of negligence. I accuse a French state of corruption, incompetence, negligence. And so the question then is, why are these people so riled up about this one guy in prison? And the answer is, it has to do with the French identity. At this point in history, there's this huge conflict between French liberals who see themselves as hears to the French Revolution and monarchists who want to get rid of revolutionary elements. For the liberals, like ML Zola, the Republic is about maintaining the rights of all citizens. And if one citizen loses his right, if one citizen is mistreated by the justice system, then all citizens will be mistreated by the justice system. So even though Alfred Dreifers is a Jew, the French form first and foremost as a French citizen because the French nation exists protect the rights of all those who are citizens of France. Okay, does that make sense? That's why this was a huge deal in France. And it lasted for about 10 years. And of course the German response to the Jewish question, what's the Holocaust? Okay, so these are two different conceptions of nationalism, the French and the German. All right, any questions before I move on? Okay, is this clear? Great. So let's continue on the nation state, okay? So before 1848, the nation state nationalism, it was contained in Europe because nationalism was actually a threat to the monarchy, right? Because nationalism would reduce a lot of their powers. But in 1848, there were too many revolutions and rebellions throughout Europe. And monarchs at this point recognized that they can't really hold back the tide of social change. And so certain nations like Germany start to embrace nationalism as a way to contain these social changes. Once they should say it came into being, they needed a philosophy about culture. And this man, Charles Storwin, provides that in the origin of species, right? He presents a new theory of human development that contradicts all Christian teaching, which is the idea of evolution, okay? And so the idea of this is that God has no design, okay? We are who we are by random chance for the process of evolution. And this will give birth to the idea of something, racism. Okay, because if it's true that God has no say in how we develop, if it's true that we develop by chance, then we can also extrapolate from this that, well, there's certain people that must be inherently superior to others. Right, there are certain people that must have evolved to be more intellectual, to be more scientific, to be more brave. And because Europe at this time is the wealthiest and strongest and most advanced part of the world, then we can also reason that Europeans must also be superior as the people to everyone else, the Africans, the Asians, okay? Right? So this introduced the idea of sonic racism. And this is a really popular thing to do back then. One thing that they were really interested in is skull, because they figured out if they can measure the skull, then they can make generalizations about the different brains of different cultures. And of course, the entire point of this exercise was to prove that in fact Europeans were superior. OK? This also leads to the idea of eugenics. This is Francis Colton, who is a cousin of Charles Darwin. And both Charles Darwin and Francis Colton was concerned about the gene pool, right? Because for Darwin, evolution meant that bad genes were systematically eliminated from the system. But at a time of improved sanitation, of improved hospital care, then people who should have died are living, right? And this is gonna dilute the quality of your gene pool. So Francis Goulton proposed the idea of eugenics, that a nation that society should systematically eliminate bad genes from the gene pool in order to maintain its purity. And there are three ways that you can do this, right? The first is you can do forced sterilization. So people who might be handicapped or they are criminals, you sterilize them to prevent them from reproducing. That's one solution. Another solution is, well, execution, right? So if you're a criminal or you are physically violent or if you are low IQ, then we should just execute you to prevent you from polluting the gene pool. And the third solution is to limit migration, okay? Limit immigration and limit migration. And this is an extremely popular idea in the United States, right, because at this time in history, you have all these Europeans from low genetic stock, the Polish, the Irish, the Italians, the Eastern Europeans coming into the United States at this time. And this was supposed to be a real threat to the WASP elite. And that's why in the United States this eugenics movement really takes off. The really central eugenics movement in the world at the end of the 20th century, sorry, at the end of the 19th century, the beginning of the 20th century, is really the United States. there are many many states in the United States that pass forestalization laws. This is Madison Grant. He wrote a very popular book about how there are different races. And the Nordic race, the Germans, the Scandinavidians, and the British, they are the dominant race. They are the superior race. But over time, the numbers are deluding. And therefore, the Nordic people must work together, okay? And guess who really enjoys this idea? Who was a big fan of Madison Graz, Hitler, right? And the Nazis will translate his book and spread his book. And a lot of his ideas will become a basis for Nazi eugenics policy. And the Nazis were notorious for taking the disabled, the handicapped, and basically forcing them into gas chambers. This is what he says, a rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit, which solved the whole question in 100 years, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd up our JLs, hospitals, and insane as times. It's hard for us to imagine, but in the 1930s, this is a really widespread idea in America, in Britain, and in Germany. Extremely widespread among the elite. In fact, in 1935, if you asked me what was most likely to happen, then I would tell you that America, Britain, and Germany would ally themselves, because they saw themselves as one people and they would attack the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union was a Slavic country that was communist and both the Slavs and the communists were a threat to the Nordic people who were capitalistic. Right? That's in 1935, that was the most likely scenario. In fact, there were a lot of people proposing this scenario. So why is it that it would be America and Britain who would support Soviet Union in destroying Germany? Well, that's a question we will look at next class, okay? Because it's a huge mystery what had happened when the, when in reality it should have been America, Britain, and Germany versus Soviet Union, okay? All right, so this now gives us the age of imperialism. The Europeans now need more resources, but they're also spreading their cultural mission to slice the entire world because they are the master race, right? They have the white men's burden to civilize all others. Now, they didn't go into Africa before because of malaria issues. If you're European, you went into Africa, you're going to die. But with major advancements in medicine, they now had medicine against malaria. And very quickly, they basically carved up Africa amongst themselves. They had a conference, and they decided who we get, who. And their imperialism in Africa was notorious, right? It was one of the worst atrocities in human history, especially in the Congo, which was controlled by Belgium. Basically the king of Belgium, Leopold, had a mercenary army go in, insulate the people and extract all the resources from the Congo, and it was his own personal property, whose own personal estate. Okay? All right. Also China, okay? So China was basically carved up by the Europeans, right? The Americans negotiated something called the open door policy and they were agreed to carve turnip into different sections, okay? We call these the treaty ports. Now, the problem for the Europeans though are the Japanese. So in the European understanding of the world, the Europeans are superior, right? Especially the northern people. So everyone else should automatically submit and surrender to the Europeans. And that's what happened in Africa, and that's what happened in China, but not in Japan. Japan underwent tremendous social change called a major restoration to go from a feudal society into a modern industrial nation that in 1905 was able to defeat a major European power, the Russians, in a war. Okay, and this was shocking because this went against all understanding of the world at this time. What really surprised people was the rapid pace of transformation in Japan. It was as though everyone decided that we as people needed to change and we're gonna change today, okay? And that's what Japan did. So you look at politics. In 1898, they will establish basically a parliament. And by 1928, you had universal male suffrage. Basically, in 1928, every man in Japan could vote. Economically, the Japanese economy exploded. If you go to Japan today, you'll be amazed by how well organized the society is. Everyone, almost everyone in Japan, reverse parks. If you look at this picture, maybe there's this one guy for whatever reason who decides not to reverse park. But everyone else reverse parks. There's no law that says you must reverse park. Everyone just does it because of a sense of social cohesion. In the 13th century, the Mongols having conquered Korea and China and most of Asia, launched two invasions of Japan, which both of these invasions failed. Now, the myth is the kamikaze, the divine wind, which saved Japan from the invasion. That's not true. That's just part of Japanese mythology. The real reason, what really happened is the Mongols were able to land forces both times. But what they discovered was they could not divide and conquer. Usually the policy of invader is to find local allies, establish a beachhead on the island, and then slowly expand outwards. That's a policy. But in Japan, the Mongols could not find any local allies. The people were united against the invaders. As a result, it became too expensive and too burdensome for the Mongols to take over Japan. Okay, does that make sense and this is and this creates the sense of national identity and national unity that still persists today All right, and that's why I just say this but The strongest nation in East Asia is not China. It's Japan Okay, you have to look at social cohesion. You have to look look at how willing people are willing to fight and die for the nation and And historically, the nation with the most patriotism has always been Japan, not China, okay? So please keep this in mind. All right. Now we go into World War I and World War II. In 1871, the German Empire is proclaimed, okay? The Prussians unite all of Germany into one political entity, and now there are threats to Britain, Because remember, the British foreign policy is, we must always ensure a balance of power in Europe. If one power arises, we must fight it, okay? So when Napoleon arose, Britain spent infinite amount of money and resources to defeat Napoleon, which it only did, okay? Now with Germany in power in Europe, Britain is now going to challenge it and ensure a balance of power in Europe, okay? Does that make sense? At the same time, what's happening is the spread of nationalism throughout the Ottoman and Austria-Hungary Empire. Remember the Ottomans and the Austria-Hungary Empire are these multi-ethnic empires that don't really have any reason to exist anymore in an age of the nation state and of nationalism. Okay, so this is the Ottoman Empire. They're based in Istanbul, okay? but they also occupy what we call the Balkans, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia. So the Greeks rebel against the Ottomans and they're successful in doing so in the Greek War of Independence. Now, we talk a lot of the Greeks and it may surprise you to hear, like for the most of its history, the Greeks didn't concern themselves as one people, as one culture, as one nation. So that's why the Greeks never were able to expand that far. The Athenians, Spartans were too busy finding each other to deal with others. Ultimately, it was the Macedonians who conquered Persia, not the Greeks. This is the Italian War of Independence. The Italians rebelled against the Austria-Hungary Empire. So the Austria-Hungary Empire comes into threat as well. And again, the Austrian Hungry Empire, it is a multi-ethnic state. And the nation and the different ethnicities in the Austrian Hungry Empire, it is clamoring for independence. The Austrian Hungry Empire, there are lots of Slavs, Slavic people within it, and they're calling to Russia for aid, okay? And as you know, what starts World War I is a assassination of the hated Austrian Hungry Empire by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo, right? Which brings also the Hungarian empire into direct conflict with Russia, which then brings in Britain and Russia, sorry, which brings in Britain and Germany as well. And this creates World War I. And World War I and World War II are the deadest wars in human history by far, okay? Millions and millions of people are killed. After World War I, You have the rise of extreme nationalism, which is what we call fascism, okay? Fascism is just the extreme version of nationalism. This is Mussolini, who is the founder of fascism. And he explains fascism in this way. We have created our myth. The myth is a faith, a passion. It is not necessary for it to be reality. It is a reality in the sense that it is a stimulus, it's hope, it's faith, it's courage. Our myth is the nation. Our myth is the greatness of the nation. And to this myth, this greatness, which we want to translate into a total reality, we separate everything else. If I was to believe that, the nation, the people is in the eternal struggle of the fittest. It must defeat other nations if it is to survive. And even though the nation looks weak, as long as we stick together, as long as we believe in each other, As long as we fight together, we will be invincible. Okay, and this is the, again, this is the romantic nationalism, driving both Italy as well as of course Germany. This is our fascist, Philip Marini, and he says, we want to glorify war, the only cure for the world and militarism, patriotism, and the beautiful ideas which kill. Okay, so for fascists, war is a good thing because war automatically unites people together in the final struggle for survival. And war is a process that you can use to remote people into the most extreme nationalist. Does that make sense? This of course leads to the rise of Hitler in Germany, as well as Stalin in the Soviet Union. So we're gonna focus on Stalin, next class. I mean he's that important of a historical figure, okay? So, but after World War II, people started to look at the tremendous carnage catastrophe of what had happened, okay? This is Hannah Arendt and she wrote a book called The Origins of Tolateranism. It is a fantastic book, by the way. It's one of my favorite books, definitely consider the greatest work of political philosophy in the 20th century. It's basically required reading in university when you go there. And in it, she basically tries to explain why the Holocaust happened, why World War II happened, how is it possible for the Nazis to rise in power in Germany and for the Communist to rise in power in the Soviet Union. But what she explains is this. The ideal subject of the Salterian rule is not to convince Nazi or to dedicate commonance, but people for whom the distinction between that and fiction, true and false, no longer exists. So what she believes, what she argues is that these regimes systematically eroded people's capacity to judge for themselves. Okay? Basically, these regimes destroyed the idea of the individual. That's what allowed for totoleontinism to arise in these states. This is Karl Popper. And Karl Popper is like Hannah Arendt, a European Jew who escaped the devastation of the Holocaust and the war. And they both went to America. And he wrote a very famous book called The Open Society. And he argues, the open society is one in which men have learned to be some extent critical of taboos and to base decisions on authority of their own intelligence. So what he argues is for peace to happen, for peace to ultimately thrive in this world, we need to celebrate the individual rather than the nation. So we need to be skeptical of these grand theories of human history. We need to avoid Hegel. We definitely need to avoid Marx, but also Plato. These are the three baddies of the Western tradition. Plato, Hegel, and Marx. Because they're anti-democratic, they're anti-individual, but also they have a theological view of history of things that's moving towards the final end. That is a megalomaniacal view to understand the world. We need to be skeptical. We need to ecumenically make change to society. And so what he's really doing is he is proposing that Anglo-American civilization is far superior, far more scientific, far more advanced than both Russian and German civilization. That's what he's really doing. And that's why Karl Popper's open society has become an integral basis for the American Empire. Okay? So very quickly, let's understand the difference between World War II and the Pax Americana, which is the age we live in today. World War II was about the nation state, okay, the rise of nationalism and fascism. The Pax Americana is about the international rules-based order, okay? The nations, human rights, the Geneva Convention, all these things, okay? It's what they call the rules based in national order. Another difference is World War II was about mercantilism. Mercantilism is basically your own separate trading zone. You only trade within this zone. So that creates an incentive for Britain, for Germany, for France to go and conquer other colonies in order to facilitate their own industrial production. America's saying, no guys, let's just focus on global free trade. Let's have everyone trade together, and if everyone trades together, there is going to be peace. War II was a separation of the union of will, right? That's what fascism is, the union of will. We as a people, if we come together, we will be this invincible, inelible historical force that will overwhelm the whole world. Today, we just focus on consumerism. Just go buy things, guys, okay? Buy things, be happy, we're good, all right? So this is this introduction. We will discuss this when we finish the class with the American Empire, okay? That's next Thursday, all right? But that is that, okay. So, call purpose open society, rule break, and the American Empire creates these new trends in society that really weren't there before, okay? So for example, identity politics, okay? Identity politics is one such trend. Identity politics is really the celebration of individual helplessness. We're all individuals and we all require the state to help us. So the state is fundamentally about protecting the vulnerable, including minorities, including women, including immigrants. Does that make sense? That's what identity politics is, really. You also have mass immigration. And again, mass immigration is celebrated in America and in European nations right now. And historically this was not true. They maybe they had immigration, but it was more of an academic need. And there's a lot of political pushback against mass immigration. Today it's celebrated. But when you do that, when you have identity politics and mass immigration together, ultimately creates a conservative pushback, which is what we're seeing today. Okay? So the Trump era, which started only a few months ago, there's mass deportation going on. It's possible that you guys would not be allowed to go to the United States. All of this is possible because of this conservative pushback. All right? So in other words, even though the nation state created a lot of problems that the Pax Americana is trying to resolve by focusing on more individual rights, the focus on individual rights is gonna create more problems that may also allow for a return of nationalism in the future. And I think that's a very strong possibility that we'll discuss at the end of the course on Thursday. Okay? All right, so that's it. And again, what's really important for us to remember is that this is all just set up for the next two classes, which will end the course. So this is all just background information for you guys. But was anything unclear about today? Anything you guys are not clear about? Any questions? Oh, what's the difference between naturalism and occult? So there's really little difference between naturalism and religion. But a cult is something that we mean, it's much more like limited, much more small, and it requires rituals as well, okay? But I think you're right, I think like, you can make the argument that nationalism, it is a form of religion, definitely. Great, okay? Does that make sense? Thank you. Any more questions? Okay, okay great. So next class, we will do the Communist Revolution, the Soviet Union and the rise of Stalin."}

So today we continue the Vikings and this morning we will look at their world view, their cultural system. And as I mentioned last class, I do believe that the Viking culture is truly one of the outstanding cultures in Western civilization. The problem, though, is we know actually very little about the Viking culture, and there are certain reasons for that. The first reason is that they were purposefully an oral tradition. So it is our prejudice, it is our belief that a literary culture is superior to an oral tradition. It's harder to read and write. But what we forget is that when we transition from an old tradition to a literary culture, we lose a lot in the process. And there are many cultures that have the capacity to read and write, but they chose not to because for them it was much more important to preserve their old tradition than it was to adopt a literary culture. And as I explained in today's lecture, there are many actually good reasons why you would want to preserve an oral tradition. That's the first reason. The Vikings were purposely an oral tradition culture. The second reason is that eventually the Vikings would convert to Christianity. And in this conversion process, which would take generations, they had to abandon a lot of their tradition and heritage, including their mythologies and their historical memory. The Vikings were perceived as barbarians by the Christians. And because of the traumatic Viking encounters with Europe, there was an intention or purpose in trying to eradicate the Viking memory. Okay, so please keep in mind that we don't know that much about the Vikings. What we do know about the Vikings comes from two sources. The first is archaeology. We basically dug up their graves, some of their graves, not all their graves, and through their graves we're able to reconstruct some of their culture. But the main source of our understanding is through Norse mythology. Unfortunately, we only have a fraction of their entire mythology. Their mythology is vast, it's grand, it's epic, it's beautiful. But we only have a fraction of that. And unfortunately, over time, Christians, Christian intellectuals, want to sanctify or purify the Norse mythology. Because the Norse mythology is extremely violent and sexual. And so they basically clean it up, which means that a lot of what we have has been interpreted through Christian lens. So please be careful about that. So I will try my best to reconstruct the Viking worldview. But please understand there are severe constraints and limitations. And the way I will reconstruct the Viking worldview is by comparing contrasting it with other mythologies, other civilizations, other cultures, and by using literary interpretation. And ultimately, by using my imagination. So please take what I say with a grain of salt. Be skeptical, be suspicious, ask questions, challenge me, where you feel you need to. Okay? All right. So let's get started. All right. Let's look at the Viking tradition in contrast to the Greeks and the Romans. Okay? So the Greeks. How do they see the world? Remember, the idea of the community was the idea of the polis. The polis is, gives us our work for politics. The idea is that a community is a group of men, only men, who come together to debate and argue of the future of the community. And as such, the individual is someone who stands out. The word they use is eudaimonia or arete. Eudaimonia means flourishing. You can only flourish if you stand out among a group of men. Arete is proving your excellence among a group of men. And so, I'll give you two examples of this Greek worldview. So the first is Achilles from the Iliad. Remember, in the Iliad, Achilles tells everyone, I am in Troy to seek personal glory. I don't care about the Greeks. I don't care about Helen or Troy. I don't care about what others think. I just want to stand out. I care about my own personal glory. And that's why he's willing to let Hector and the Trojans almost destroy the Greek army. Okay, so that's one example. Another example is from Herodotus, his book Histories. And it has to do with the Athenian leader Themistocles. Okay, so this is a year 480 BCE. And in the year for ADBCE, the Persians are invading the Greek mainland. Sparta, Athens have united against the Persians. The Persians burned down Athens and the Athenian people are on their ships. And at this point, the Spartans who are in command of the military and Athenians have a huge argument. The Athenians want to challenge the Persians on the sea and defeat them and defeat their navy. The Spartans want to use their navy to protect their homeland, the Peloponnese, against the Persian invasion. And they cannot come to an agreement. So what the Mastocles does is he sends a spy, a servant, to the king of the Persians and tell him, The entire Greek Navy is stationed in Salamis. Okay? And, but they're about to run away from you. So here's a great chance to send your entire Persian Navy to crush the Greek Navy once and for all. And that's what the king does. And at the battle of Salamis, the Athenians, and the Spartans destroyed the Persian Navy and churned the course of, not only the war, but of Western history. Because if the Persians had won that day, then we would be living in a Persian-influenced world as opposed to a Greek-influenced world. But if you think about it, what Achilles and Thamexies are doing is what we would call sedition, or treason, or betrayal. But that's just the Greek worldview. The Romans had a very different perspective. They understood community as fundamentally about tradition. And as such, the individual had to be pious to the tradition, had to be loyal to the tradition. They used the word piety. Now, in China, we have a concept called filial piety. Guys, this is very important. Completely opposite. In China, filial piety means obedience to your father. What your father says is right, okay? That's what it means. But in Rome, piety means loyalty to the traditions of Rome. So the classic example is Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar wanted to be king. He was about to break a lot of Roman traditions. So his friends, including his biological son, Marcus Brutus killed him. It was more important for Marcus Brutus to be loyal to the traditions of Rome than to be loyal to his father. Okay, so that's the Roman tradition. Then you have the Viking tradition. For the Vikings, and this is very interesting, the community is a set of stories. Okay, and stories are not the same as tradition. Tradition is what is past. It is what is written down. Stories are memories that are living. That which a community tells about itself. And therefore, there is a flexibility to these stories. They can be reimagined over and over. The basic structure, the outline is the same, but the community has to constantly relive and reimagine these stories. And therefore, the individual is a person who acts out these stories, acts out these stories. And he acts out these stories by either through ritual, either through adventure or exploration. Okay, so this is hard to understand, okay? How is this different from the Roman tradition? But let me tell you a story to illustrate this Viking culture. Okay, so 30 years ago, a long time ago, I was having lunch with a new friend. And he went to a very good school called Georgetown. It's based in Washington, DC. And it's where Bill Clinton went, okay? This is where a lot of the Washington foreign policy elite go to school. And he told me that at Georgetown, there's a tradition, a competition among undergraduates. And the competition is who can go the furthest to do the most useless thing. And a lot of undergraduates participate in this competition. So what my friend and his friend did was, one day they got in a car, they drove 12 hours to Canada, they came in the border. They cross the came in the border, then they got out of the car and went into the forest to take a piss. Then they got back in the car and drove all the way back to Georgetown. They spent 24 hours driving so that they could take a piss in Canada. Okay? Now you think this sounds really stupid, but the most interesting thing about the story is that it is memorable, right? Memorable. And what this means is that 50 years after they graduate from Georgetown, people will still remember what they did. Not only that, but they'll tell their friends, they'll tell their colleagues, they'll tell their children. So this memory will persist over time. No one to remember who got the best grades at Georgetown that year. No one to remember who had the most money, who made the most money in her life. But everyone should remember these two guys who got in their car and drove 24 hours just so that they can go to Canada to take a piss. So that is like in culture. It's not about winning glory or protecting tradition. It's about doing what is shocking, what is new, what will add to the imagination and the memory of the community. Does that make sense? So the main memory is, of course, the mythology, Norse mythology. And Norse mythology, I would argue, is the greatest mythology in human history. We still have it today. Okay, you might have seen these Marvel movies, right? Thor, the Thor series. There are a lot of TV shows based on the Vikings. So the Viking culture, the Norse mythology, it's still celebrated today. Okay, so let me explain to you why I would argue that Norse mythology is probably the greatest cosmological system we have. Okay, so first it's grand. In this mythology there are nine realms. Okay? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. And it's all connected by a world tree called Idrcel. Okay? No one knows what this world tree looks like, but it's basically the equivalent of God in this system. Okay? And in this Idrcel there are three gods who control the fate and destiny of the world called the nones. So it's very grand and epic. Also, what's important to understand is there's nothing outside this universe. This is it. Second is that it's complete. What I mean by that is it has a beginning and has an end. The beginning is there's a rift, and from the rift steps a frost giant named Imar. And then comes a cow, a cosmic cow, who then licks the ice and that releases another god, who will eventually give birth to another god, who will give birth to the three major gods, including Odin. And these three major gods will kill Imar, and from Imar's carcass they will build the universe. OK? That's the beginning. But there's also an N. And the N is what I call, what's what they call, Ragnarok. Ragnarok. And Rana-rok is the end of everything. It is a final battle between the gods, what we'll call the Asir. So Odin is the all-father, the main god, but in all children are called the Asir. The Asir will fight a final cosmic battle between them and their enemies. And in this final battle, everything will die. Nothing will be left. Then that's it. Now, as I mentioned, the Christian tradition will take the story and adapt it for its own ends. So in the Christian tradition, right now it does happen, but guess what? After the end of the world, two humans, a man and a woman, will emerge from the destruction and reconstitute the world, okay? That's the Christian tradition. In the Norse tradition, everything ends. And you may think to yourself, Oh, well this sounds extremely pessimistic. That's only because we're looking at it from our perspective. From the perspective of the Vikings, the end of the world means that you must cherish every single day. Live with honor, live with glory, live with courage. Cherish every moment, okay? And that's the idea. The third thing about Norse mythology is that it's unified. So all the characters, everything that happens is contained within this mythology and contributes to the development of this mythology. So this mythology not only includes gods, but also includes humans, okay? Who are champions of the gods. So there's a very famous love story within this mythology between a human named Sigard and a Valkyrie who is a servant of the gods named Brumhilde. Eventually what will happen is that there'll be a very famous German composer named Wagner who will take the story of Sigard Bohemdi and this entire Norse mythology and construct something called the Ring Cycle, which is the most famous opera in German history. and this becomes one of the foundations of modern German culture. This Norse mythology will also become the inspiration for tokens epic called Lord of the Rings. Okay, so these are the two most obvious examples of how Norse mythology still impacts our world today. And as we go along the semester, I will show other influences. So what Norse mythology is trying to do is create community among the Vikings and instill certain values. The three major values that these stories manifest and express are courage. The courage to explore, the courage to seek what is new and unknown, to venture forth into the unknown. because Vikings are mainly explorers and adventurers. Rating is only a small part of their community, okay? Second is the idea of loyalty. And this is a very important concept. When you go out on new adventures, you're usually going out with your brothers, your friends. It's like a band of brothers. So you have to survive. you have to be willing to die for them. You have to die for each other. If the survival of the group requires you to make the sacrifice, you have to do so. Loyalty. Loyalty means love for each other. It does not mean obedience. Remember, the Viking world, it is very egalitarian. There's very little hierarchy. There are high status people, but there are high status because they're proving themselves worthier than the others because they're braver, because they are stronger, because they are more clever. The last liking value is resourcefulness. So the idea here is when you venture off into the unknown, you cannot know what to expect. You can't plan ahead, you can't be strategic. So you can only be resourceful, meaning you must respond to the danger as it arises. That's what we call quick witted. You have to have street smarts. So these are the three main values or ideas that Norse mythology is trying to express and instill in the people. So that's a general introduction to Viking culture. Now what I will do is I will provide evidence and examples for this argument. But is this clear to you guys? Okay, all right, so now let's do the PPT. And look at the evidence and the examples. Okay, all right, the Viking worldview. All right, first thing I need you guys to understand is that every culture, every society fundamentally asks itself three questions. That this painting from Paul Gauguin captures, okay? Where do we come from? Where, what are we? Where are we going? Every culture is trying to grapple with these three questions. Paul Gauguin, I'm not sure if you know who he is. He is a very famous French artist. He started off actually as a financier, a stockbroker, and then he basically became disgusted with the material lifestyle of modern society. So he got on a boat and went to Tahiti, where he painted. He interacted with the natives. And through this interaction, he began to grapple with what it means to be a human. What is the human project? And what he believes and what most actually anthropologists believe is to be human is to ask these three questions. Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? And that's ultimately what Norse mythology is trying to grapple with as well. Okay, so again, we know our evidence or understanding of the Vikings comes from archaeology. So we are able to take up their graves. And what we discover is, and it's very interesting, is that each grave is unique. And it seems that each grave, in its own way, is telling a story about who this person is. It's like this grave was not meant just to send this individual into the afterworld, but also to remember him or her, and his or her achievements and life. Let's look at some reconstruction of these graves. As you can see, this woman is buried with tools and arrow, as well as a dead horse. So we're not able to reconstruct her story, but obviously those who knew her knew exactly what the story represented. This is another example where man is buried with his ship. The Vikings are the only society to bury people in ships. Another example, and as you can see, they're all unique. In fact, what's really interesting for us is to appreciate that funerals were the most important aspect of Viking society. It's what brought the community together, and it was what they remember the most. It is funerals are what contributed to historical memory in the Viking world. As you can see, this funeral is extremely elaborate, involving a lot of animal sacrifice. These horses are being gathered up to be sacrificed. There's also human sacrifice. And these funerals can last for a long time, 10 days. So again, because the Vikings never wrote anything down, we actually don't know that much about these funerals. In fact, we only have one historical record of a funeral. And this happened in the Viking Rus. So this is Eastern, the Eastern world near the Volga. And it was written down by a Muslim diplomat and traveled by the name of Ahmad Ibn Badlan. And he is from the Abbasid Caliphate. And he is in the Viking world in order to negotiate a treaty of trade, okay? The Bassids and the Vikings treated it a lot. And as an honored guest, the Vikings invited him to a funeral of a deceased chieftain or king, all right? Now there's certain things about this funeral that's important for us. The first thing is that it would last 10 days, okay? It's a very elaborate affair that requires a lot of choreography and coronation. The second thing is that a third of the man's wealth were spent on the funeral expenses. So basically a feast for everyone, okay? A third were spent on his funeral clothes that was tailor made for him. So this is like the best clothes. And a third was given to his wife. What this tells us is, first of all, this man, even though he was high status, he didn't have that much wealth, right? And second of all, the Vikings are a very egalitarian society. The third thing that's important for us, they didn't care that much about wealth, period. Right? They spent a third on the funeral. They just burned away the money. Okay, so what's also important for us to remember is there is a funeral director. There's a woman who Ibn Faddin calls the angel of death who was coordinating and orchestrating this funeral. During the course of this funeral, there are things that happened that actually disgust him. So before we continue, please keep in mind that Ibn Dallin, he's an observer. He doesn't speak the language. He doesn't know culture. So he doesn't exactly know what's going on. Second of all, he's a Muslim. So he has his own cultural worldview That is in conflict with the Viking worldview. The third thing is he is writing this down after the fact. And if you do that, what often happens is that you will misremember a lot of things. So please take his description with a grain of salt, with some skepticism, but also please remember that we have no choice in that matter, because this is the only written record of our Viking funeral from this time. Okay, so we have absolutely no choice in the matter. So let's look at what he writes and then try to reconstruct the Viking culture and understanding. Okay, so first thing he says is, they cut a dog into and threw the halves into the boat and placed the man's weapons beside him. Okay, so again, they are celebrating his life, they are memorizing his life. They had two horses run themselves sweaty, cut them to pieces and threw the meat into the ship. Finally, they killed two cows and a cock and did the same with them. Okay? So not only are they remembering him, but they're giving him supplies to help to sustain him as he ventures and voyages into the afterworld. Now, this is interesting. They asked for human sacrifice and a slave girl volunteers, volunteers. Okay? Clearly she didn't volunteer, but she volunteers. And let's see what, what happens. Meanwhile, the slave girl went from one tent to the other and had sexual intercourse with the master of each. Every man told her, tell your master that I have done this purely out of love for you. Okay, this is incorrect. It should be for him, all right? So this is really confusing for us. It's a funeral and they're having sex with the woman who is about to be sacrificed. So we have absolutely no idea what's going on. But I'm going to make a guess. I'm going to use my imagination. First, it's important for us to understand who the slave girl is. She's not a normal person. I believe, I would argue that she must be the lover of the deceased chieftain. Why? OK. It's logic. Remember the Iliad. In the Iliad, the entire story begins with a problem. The problem is that Eggermanon, the leader of the Greeks, he has kidnapped a girl who happens to be the daughter of a high priest to Apollo. And the king and the priest comes to him and says, I will give you all the gold in the world, but please give me back my daughter. And all the Greeks are said, oh, you should do that Eggermanon, please give back the daughter, okay? That's just the custom of war. If a father can ransom the daughter, you have to return her. But Aegean Menonon says this, I'm not going to return her because I love her. I love her more than my wife. And as a result, the High Priest prays to a polo who unleashes a deadly plague among the Greeks. The Greeks are dying. So finally Achilles steps up and says to Aegean Menon, you have to return the girl. All right? Now Aegean Menon has lost faith. So he says to Achilles, fine, I will return the girl that I love more than anything else in the world, but you must give me your girl, your slave girl. And Achilles gets so angry at this that he refuses to fight for the Greeks, which leads to the disaster of the chosen war. Okay? So what is this telling us? This is telling us that in this world where these men are far from home and they kidnap These slave girls, they fall in love with them. And in the process of falling in love with them, these great men confer stats and power onto these slave girls. Okay, does that make sense? All right, I know this is hard to understand, but this slave girl is not a normal girl. She is the lover, the mistress, essentially the wife of the chieftain who's died. Okay, so another question then is, why has she volunteered to cure herself? Okay, well if we continue the logic, then I would argue that it's because without the man, she has no status and power in the community. She'll go back to being a slave, and she might be ostracized. So by volunteering and sacrificing herself, she will win status and power and honor for her children and for her relatives in the community. She will make her family part of that community. Okay, that's why she does this. Now then the question then is, okay, I don't get it now because if in fact the slave girl is the chief and favorite mistress, and if this slave girl does in fact love this man, why is she having sex with everyone? Okay, and the answer is in this world, gifts are very important. Basically if you go to war and you win things, you have to show everyone, okay? So what this deceased man is saying, now that I'm dead, I give you one final gift. And it's the greatest treasure that I can possibly give you, which is the woman I love, okay? And that's why each man is forced to have sex with her. And they tell this girl, when you go to your master, tell him, I only do this out of my love for him, Him not for you. I don't have sex with you. I do not want to have sex with you but I will in order to Celebrate him to honor him to love him Yes, so do that's a great question in the imagination are they having sex with the dead master and Yes, you can make that argument okay because remember in this world Homosexuality is not it doesn't exist. It's very it's okay for men have sex with each other It's okay for men to have sex with, together with one woman, okay? And that's how they create intimacy and bonding. Because remember, when you're out in war, you have to be able to make the ultimate sacrifice. So you have to bond with your fellow soldiers. And the best way to bond is through sex, okay? Sex with each other, but also sex with other women, okay? So, yeah, so you can make that argument, okay? Again, I don't know what goes on their heads, but if you extend the logic, yes, then they think they're having sex with a master, through the girl. All right, and that's why they say, I'm only doing this out of my love for him, not for you, but for him, okay? So, let's continue, okay? In the afternoon, they move the slave girl to something that looked like a door frame where she was lifted on the palms of the man three times. So the door frame represents access to the afterworld, okay? So she's being sacrificed now. The first time she saw her father and mother. The second time she saw all her deceased relatives. And the third time she saw her master in paradise. Okay? So what this is, is she, the slave girl, who is not part of the community. What she's really doing is implanting her personal memory into the community as a whole. She's making her family part of the community now. She's talking about her past. And everyone, again, this is a community event. Everyone's observing. Everyone can hear her. So they know that after she dies, they must honor her memory by honoring her wealth and family. There it was green and beautiful. And together with him she saw man and young people. She saw her master beckon for her. Then she was brought chicken, which she had caspated, in which it was then thrown on the boat. Again, this is some strange ritual that I have to say no idea what it means, but it must mean something. Often what they do is they reenact mythologies. So there must have been a famous story where a woman decapitates a chicken for some reason. And she's doing that. They are reliving mythologies. All right, let's continue. There after the slave girl was taking away to the ship, she removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. She took what was most valuable to her and gave her to the old woman, who is the angel of death, the funeral director. So what she's doing is giving thanks to the old woman. She's giving her a gift, she's bribing her for the honor of being sacrificed. Thereafter, she removed her anklets and gave them to the old man's two daughters. Then they took her abroad the ship, but they did not allow her to enter the tent where the dead chipped in lay. She's about to be sacrificed. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang. These intoxicating drinks are often psychedelics. All right? So these psychedelics are meant to enhance her visuals. Now she's singing. Before the old woman urged her to enter the tent, I saw that the girl did not know what she was doing. Notes, Ibn Thalim. So Ibn Thalim is completely confused by this. But what we need to understand is, this is highly choreographed, right? Every person knows what to do in this process. It's a ritual, meaning that there's a script in place, and meaning that the chieftain and the slave girl and the old woman all disgust us beforehand, okay? That's the only way this makes sense. Then the girl was pulled into the tent by the old woman and the men start to beat on their shields with sticks so her screams could not be heard. Okay, so the tent is being surrounded by warriors with shields, okay? Six men enter the tent to have intercourse with a girl after which they laid her onto her master's bed beside him, all right? So six men basically rape her together. And what this is doing is reenacting the memory of being with their chieftain, right? Going out in raids, sacking a city, and then raping the woman together. Guys, I know this is terrible. I know this is terrible. But again, we have to try to understand their world view and their practice. The two men grabbed her hands and two men her wrists. The angel of death looped a rope around her neck and while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs over the knife. Okay, she's being sacrificed by the angel of death and that's how she dies. All right? Thereafter, the closest male relative of the dead chieftain walked backwards naked, covering his anus with one hand and a piece of burning wood with the other. Again, this must come from a certain mythology, okay? That's the only way we can explain this practice. Why is he going around naked? He ships a flame after which other people added wood to the fire, okay? And that's how he dies. All right, again, this sounds gruesome. What they're doing is they are celebrating the man and implanting his memory into the community. Because everyone participates in this funeral, the man, his memory is now part of the community's collective consciousness. He has become a story within the community and therefore will be remembered forever for his achievements. Does that make sense guys? All right, so this is again a depiction of the funeral. And again, the Greeks and the Romans had equivalents. So that, and we'll discuss these equivalents so you better understand what's going on. For the Romans that's something called the triumph. The triumph was the highlight of Roman life. It was basically a general who won great conquests and so he came back in a military parade. The parade will offer a lot of things. It would offer some pictures of the Concord territory. It would parade treasures like elephants or gold captured from the conquered people, it will also parade slaves and captured people, usually kings, and it will feature the soldiers as well as the triumphant general. What's important for us to remember is at the end of this parade, they go to the temple of Jupiter, their god, and they will sacrifice these slaves and these captured kings to the god, to the god Jupiter. So it's very similar to the funeral, guys. The Greeks, on the other hand, had theater to build the community's collective consciousness. The community all participated in the theater. So there were no professional actors. It was community members that participated in the theater. And the community, the spectators, would judge which theater was the best. It was the highlight of the community to pick the best playwright for that year. It was the greatest honor, it was like winning the Nobel Prize, basically. The theater was, it's very different. They didn't practice any human sacrifice. They didn't parade slaves around. What they did was, often was, write about war from the perspective of the enemy. Okay, so, Euripides wrote something called a children woman where he wrote about the children woman who were raped and captured and kidnapped by the Greeks. And this is wrote about the Persian loss. Okay, and that's why the Greek civilization is considered the most imaginative in human history because it practice empathy. It changes perspectives. it's willing to celebrate everyone. Okay, so that's a Greek world. Okay, all right, let's talk a little about Norse mythology. Remember what I said was that Norse mythology, its purpose is to express and promote three values, courage, loyalty, and resourcefulness. So the example of courage is Odin. At the beginning of the world, Odin who's a god of knowledge, he wants to seek all knowledge. So he flies around Ijosephal, the world tree, and he goes into different realms. And he meets a god, what's something called the wealth cosmic knowledge. If you drink from the soup, you gain cosmic knowledge. So Odin wanted to drink it, but he had to make an offering. So he offered what was most valuable to him, which was his eye, guys, okay, his eye. So he plugged out his eye, gave it to the god, and drank from the wealth cosmic knowledge. But once he drank from the well and learned cosmic knowledge, he became more curious about the universe. And so he started to venture into more unknowns. Eventually he went into the realm of death. And no matter how hard he tried, he could not penetrate this world. There are too many wins. There are too many barriers. So he killed himself, right? Because that's what you do. If you want to enter a deaf world, you have to kill yourself. So he killed himself and was dead for a long time. But in his death, he was able to see all the secrets of the universe. And then afterwards he resurrected himself. So Odin personifies the idea of courage in the Viking world to seek the unknown relentlessly, even if it costs you your life and your eye. The idea of loyalty. So in the Norse world, there'll be a Ragnarok. And there's a wolf, Fenris, who will foreshadow the arrival of Ragnarok. He's very dangerous. But when he's born, he's just a little pup. So the Esar, the gods, basically decided to adopt him as a pet. They think he's harmless. And his master is Tyr, who is the god of war among the Aesir. But very quickly, Fenerese grows to be huge. And now the gods seem as a menace. So they try to time up. But no matter how hard they try, they can't time up. And it becomes like a game. And Fenerese thinks this is really funny. But the gods become really worried. So they go to the dwarfs. And they ask the dwarfs to create a magic rope, which they do. And Tyr goes back to Fenerese He says, hey, let's continue this game of us trying to tie you up. Femurist is like, okay, but how do I know that you'll release me if I can't get out? Here, put your hand in my mouth, and if you don't release me, I'll take your hand. All right? So the gods discuss this and tear volunteers to do this, knowing that he's going to lose his hand. And that's what happens. They tie Ferenc up and Ferenc wants to be released. God to refuse because he's a manist. And then Ferenc just cuts off, bites off the hand. That's the idea of loyalty. Loyalty to your friends. Resourcefulness. So the gods are always at war with the frost giants. One day a man named the builder comes to them says, I can build you a wall to protect you from your enemies in 18 months. This is Asgard, the home of the gods. And the builder says, I will do this, but I want three things. I want the sun, I want the moon, and I want the beautiful goddess Freya in marriage. And Odin and the gods are like, no, that's a stupid deal. And then Loki, who is the god of mischief, and the blood brother of Odin, says to Odin, take the deal, but make it six months, give him six months. That way he'll finish about a third of the wall and we can finish the rest. And all the things, that's a great idea. And the builder agrees to this deal on one condition. He's allowed to use his horse in order to carry the bricks and the concrete. And the gods agree. they don't know is the horse is a magic horse. And the horse is able to travel as fast as light itself. And so the builder's able to really quickly build that wall and he's about to finish the wall. Odin says, Loki, you got us into this mess? Get us out of this mess or I will kill you. So what does Loki do? Loki thinks and he's a shape shifter, right? And he's able to shape shift into a mare, a beautiful horse, okay? Like this. The builder's horse sees the mare and becomes really excited, right? And he runs off. And the builder's not able to finish the wall. And Loki gives birth to a horse, a baby horse, that then becomes Odin's horse, okay? That's the idea of resourcefulness. There are some really funny stories within Norse mythology. Okay, one of the funniest is this. Thor has a magic hammer named Mogenere. He loves it. He loves it so much that he sleeps with it. He puts it under his pillow. One day he wakes up and finds it missing. So of course he thinks it must be Loki. Because Loki's always playing these tricks on the gods. But Loki says, I didn't do it and I will find out for you who did it. So Loki explores and he finds out that it was the Froschine King who stole the hammer. The Froschine King will only return the hammer if the gods give him Freya as a wife. Loki goes back and Freya says, screw off, I'm not gonna do this. So Loki says to Thor, I have a plan. The plan is he's gonna dress Thor up as Freya. He's going to put a wedding dress and a veil on Thor and Loki will disguise himself as a bridesmaid. Stupid plan, but they do this. They go off and the Frostyron King doesn't really notice that Freyja is a huge man. They have this huge feast. And unfortunately, Thor loves to eat and he loves to drink. So basically this huge feast, Thor is eating this oxen, he's drinking all this beer, and he's burping in the process. So Frost Giant King is kind of like confused, but he's also really excited. At the wedding, the Frost Giant King presents the hammer, Moldenir, to Thor, and he lifts the veil to kiss Thor, and that's when he realizes that it's actually a man. Then Thor gets his hammer and beats a crap out of the king. So there are many stories like this, which are really funny and imaginative. What do these stories tell us about the understanding of the individual in the Viking world? This is Neil Price. And to prepare for this lecture, I did a lot of research, including listening to his YouTube lecture, which He has over a million views on YouTube. But he's a Viking expert, he's an archeologist. I highly recommend that you listen to his YouTube videos if you're interested in this material. But this is what he has to say about the Viking worldview. The Viking, the individual, is shaped by four forces. First is the hummer. The hummer is basically the shell, or the shape of the person. the outer being. So it may not be the body actually, but it's the shell, okay? Second is the idea of the ha-ming-ja. The ha-ming-ja, think of it as a pet who follows you around, and it personifies luck. Okay? And because it's a pet, you can either nurture the pet or not nurture it. Okay? You nurture it by showing courage. So in battle, if you run off, if you enter the battle of courage, the pet will be with you. But if you run away and hide yourself, the pet might run away. And in the liking world, all that matters is having ja. You win if you get lucky, not because you're stronger. The third idea is huger. And huger is your essence, your soul, who you are really. And the last idea is phaija. And phaija is what you inherit from your family. It is the guardian spirit of your family. So think of it as the collection of your ancestors who whisper you advice in your dreams. Today we recall this concept intuition, right? Intuition, that's what it represents. So as you can see, Neil Price and other experts are showing us that we think of the Vikings as barbarians, but in fact, they're very complicated and nuanced understanding of themselves and the world. Okay, so now the question then is, how are the Vikings able to do this? My argument to you is it's because of the oral tradition. We are simply not creative as people who tell stories every day and who make stories the heart and center of the community. So this is an over-generalization, an over-simplification, but I want us to understand this graph before people live in their old tradition. What this meant is they tell stories. When you tell stories, you need at least two people. You need the speaker and you need the listener. You can't do it otherwise, okay? You can't tell a story to yourself. So you need at least two people. But often it was a whole community that participated in the stories. And what this meant is that the stories were living things. There were things that you played with that were flexible. They were a clay. You can change the stories over and over. Each person who told the story would tell it different. So there are like millions of different versions of these nor stories that I just told you. Okay? Because each person can interpret that story differently. So these are living memories. And that means that each story is unique. Now there's a concept and cultural theory called the aura. Okay, the essence, the soul. And each story has its own soul if you think about it. Let's contrast this with literary culture. In literary culture, reading and writing, you have to do it by yourself. You cannot write with a friend. It would be terrible if you did that. But the benefit is that whatever you write leaves you and becomes part of the page. It's permanent now. And as a result, your words can escape time and space. It becomes timeless. We have Homer because Homer's words were written down, even though Homer was probably illiterate. Today we live in the visual culture. So think of videos, think of photographs, right? First thing to understand is that it's passive. Both in literary and oral culture, you have to participate. You have to use your imagination to make the thing alive. But with a photograph, it's all provided to you, okay? It's a very passive experience. It's self-enclosed, meaning it's impossible for you to add anything to it, okay? But you get more information that way. So there are benefits to visual culture. So for example, a map, right? If you look at a map, it tells you a lot more information than if someone tried to explain it to you with words. And the last advantage of a visual culture is, it is universal. So if an alien species came down to our planet and looked at our pictures, they wouldn't know what's going on, okay? Whereas if they heard a story or read a book, they would have absolutely no idea what's going on. So, this is the old tradition in contrast with literature and visual culture. The old tradition is extremely complex. We tend to think that it's just about telling a story. But if you think about it, there are so many variables and nuance and factors in the telling of a story. And that's why each version is unique unto itself. So I could teach the same material, but we change the classroom. If we change the students, if we change the lighting, the experience of being in this classroom would change. The Norse, the Vikings, the way they told stories is they would tell it in a big hall. Because remember, it's usually cold up north. It's snowing outside. They would tell it in a big hall. And it's dark. So they have a big fire inside the hall. And the storyteller, the bard, would recite the story or tell the story beside the fire as everyone listens. Some important things to know about this. First is the halls were huge. They were as huge as a Greek amphitheater. So you could see about 1,000, 2,000 people within the hall. Second is the idea of darkness. When it's dark and you can't see, your ears become much more perceptive. So the words have become alive. They're more colored. They're more detailed. They're much more imagery. And third is these words are bouncing off the walls and they're creating echo and resonance. And so these words almost like bonds that unite everyone in the telling of the story. And if you think about it, this experience is very similar to the Ice Age. Remember last semester at the very beginning, we did the Ice Age cave paintings. And what we need to understand is people came together in these caves not to paint in the caves but to tell stories about where they came from, who they are, and where they're going. All right? And all of our ancestors, every one of them, for thousands of years, participated in this process of converging in these ice caves and hearing stories being told to them in these dark, wet caves. So this takes us back to the time of the Ice Age. It's activating a nostalgia within us and that's why the oral tradition is so powerful. Okay? All right. So these stories have been told in a certain way to excite the audience. So think of this class. In this class, we have no tests. I don't even take attendance. So when I present material in this class, it has to be interesting for you, right? Was it interesting? But it's shocking. It has emotions. It has structure. When I come to class, I actually do not script out my class. What I do is I think of the narrative structure, the story I want to tell, and then in class, depending on your reactions, depending on the question you ask, I will change some of the details in the story to make it much more interesting for you. In the old tradition, it's a co-creation, collaborative process, and that's what makes it so powerful. As an experiment, what you can do is this. Think about this. In class there might be some material you found really interesting, right? So then you go on YouTube, I post these lectures on YouTube, to try to remember the experience. And what you'll find is you cannot, okay? Because we've switched from oral culture to visual culture. The same is true if it's your birthday, okay? It's your 18th birthday, you got with your friends. And you have a wonderful time. And you're like, I wanna take a picture to remember this experience. But what you will find when you do that is picture doesn't really capture the experience for you. The picture cannot bring back the feeling for you. And that's why the Vikings were so insistent on maintaining their old tradition and not transitioning into the literary culture. Because their old tradition is what gave the community purpose and meaning. If you gave that up, then your community would lose cohesiveness. Does this make sense to you guys? Alright. So, what's the old tradition? Again, we've lost it. We've mainly lost it. But remember what it is. Okay? Let's take two things that you know very well and merge them together and then you can experience what the old tradition is. It's basically the immersion of a movie. Think of going to a good movie. And remember the power, the immersive power of being that movie. You are in that movie, okay? You combine it with the intimacy of a conversation. You just think of having this four or five hour conversation with your best friend and talking about life and love in general. The old tradition combines these two things and that's why it's so powerful. That's why it cannot be remembered. The Viking old tradition was extremely powerful, but it was so powerful that it cannot be remembered. It cannot be written down. But as I will show you in future classes, this old tradition will go on to influence major European civilization, specifically the Germans and the British, but also the Russians as well. So again, for most of human history, we as humans have shared our time together telling stories. Why do we lose the old tradition? Remember this. Why do we lose the old tradition? Well, we transition to a literary culture that emphasizes reading and writing. So in school, we have you read books, but we don't have you tell stories. We don't tell stories to you. We went from paganism to Christianity. Okay? The problem with Christianity is it is extremely centimonious. It focuses on what is good and evil. Whereas pagan culture is like whether it's interesting or not interesting, whether it's memorable or not memorable. Live a memorable, interesting, adventurous life. And the Christians are like, no that's not good because if you do that you're going to create a lot of evil. So live a good life. Avoid committing evil. The last thing is we went from a Gatian world where everyone can contribute to the story to a hierarchical world where the top the elite It insists on indoctrinating us and controlling how we think. All right? Okay, does that make sense to you guys? Any questions so far? So this is why we left the old tradition and adopted literary and visual culture. Okay, so to conclude the class, I know this is a lot to take in, it's a lot of information, I apologize, okay? But let me conclude with a story. So I have two young boys and I sleep with them, okay? And what I do is I tell them stories. I don't have them, I don't have them do math. I don't have them read books, but I tell them stories where I make them the characters, the heroes of the story. So I'll tell you one story that I told my youngest son, Mao Mao, okay? The story goes like this. It is Mao Mao's fourth birthday. And I tell Mao Mao, on your fourth birthday, something magical happens. You can pray to God, and whatever you wish for, God will grant you your wish. So Mao Mao is really excited, and he thinks a long time about what he wants. On his fourth birthday, he prays to God and says, I wish for a room full of strawberries every single day. single day. He says that and God immediately responds. Immediately in his room it's full of strawberries and Mao Mao, he loves strawberries, he eats it right away. The next day the room is also full of strawberries and he eats it again, the third day again. But by the fourth day he's kind of sick of strawberries. So eventually strawberries overflow and fill the house and then they fill the street. At this time, the neighbors are really worried and we have to explain to our neighbors, oh, it's because Mao Mao wish for strawberries and that's why we have so many strawberries. But hey, let's share strawberries together, okay? And the neighbors are at first happy but then eventually they get sick of strawberries too. And then the strawberries fill the entire street. Then the city of Beijing is filled with the strawberries. Now it's a national emergency, okay? the military come, scientists come, and we're ever trying to resolve this issue. Then the whole country of China is filled with strawberries. Then the whole kind of Asia is filled with strawberries. Eventually, everyone has to get on a spaceship and get out into space and go to the moon to recolonize the moon. But strawberries keep on overflowing until they reach the moon. At this point, the entire world says to Mao Mao, Listen, your fifth birthday is tomorrow. Please pray to God and tell Him, no more strawberries. Mama, if you do this for us, we will make you president and king of the world. We will give you all the chocolate in the world. We'll give you all the gold in the world. Can you please do this? Can you please tell God no more strawberries? If you do that, we'll give you all the chocolate in the world. And Mama says, yes, I will. And on his fifth birthday, Mao Mao closes his eyes, prays to God and says, Dear God, I wish for a room full of chocolate every day. And that's how the story ends. Okay? Now, it's a very strange story, but guess what? My son's been remembering this for a long time, but knowing that, it's going to inspire him to think about the story and tell his own stories. Okay? What I was going to do is change the story a bit and now he has his own story. He can change the characters. He can change some of the details. That's the power of the old tradition. But if I were to write down this story, I couldn't say it in this way. I couldn't do it. Let's see how I would change the story if I wanted to down. Let's say the same story but now I write it down rather than say it to Maomao himself. There's 4th birthday, Mama will pray to God for a room full of strawberries every day. Immediately his room filled with strawberries, he ate them happily. The next morning his room filled with strawberries, he ate them. The very next morning his room filled with strawberries, he did not eat them. So I have to make this story shorter, more compact, so that's easier to read. The house filled with strawberries, and the street filled with them, then the city, then the country. On his fifth birthday, Mama prayed to God for no more strawberries. His room became clean and Mama understood the power of words. You understand? Why am I doing this? Why has literary culture changed the story? Because now I know that the words leave me and they leave Mama. They go out into the wider world and therefore people will judge my words. They will think that I'm a bad father or whatever. I'm conscious of that, okay? So I change in a way that is not so offensive so that people can better appreciate this. You understand? You see the difference between oral culture and literary culture. In oral culture, you can be intimate. Therefore, you can play, you can experiment. You can be curious, you can be adventurous. And that's what leads to the imagination. But in literary culture, everyone is watching you. 100 years from now, people are still watching you. Therefore, you have a sense of shame. You're very conscious about your effect on people. So a metaphor we can use is, this transition from oral tradition to literary culture is really like the story of Adam and Eve, where because they ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge, they develop a sense of shame. They understood that they are naked, And therefore, they're being watched. And because of this, they are thrown out of the Garden of Eden. So I want to leave you with that metaphor. Oral tradition, we leave it behind and we think that is a good thing. But we tend to forget the power and beauty of the oral tradition. So I leave you with three questions, Okay? To help us better understand and remember the lecture. The first question is, what is the imagination? What is the memory? Well, in the old tradition, we would think that the imagination is just an extension of the memory. By making our stories memorable, we excite the imagination. Therefore, we allow for the process of creation. Second question is, could we have Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare without the old tradition? And the answer, I think, is no. I think we would not have the greatest poetry in human history, but it would not for the old tradition. In fact, if you think about for the past 50 years, what has humanity, even though there's like eight of us, we have more wealth and technology than ever before, what literary masterpiece have we created? I know you guys read the Dora La Club in school and it sucks. I'm telling you right now, it is terrible. It's a piece of crap. And I can't think of a literary masterpiece of the past 50 to 60 years, okay? There's some very entertaining books, all right, but not of the stature and power of Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare. And the last question I have is, does civilization make us less creative? Okay? Does being in civilization make us more ashamed of exploring, of being curious, of playing. Are we less creative because of civilization? Okay, so that's it guys, any questions? Okay, so next week we will do the Abyssin Caliphate, okay? All right, so I will see you guys next Tuesday."}

Today is my last day in Beijing. Tomorrow morning I board a flight with my two boys for Toronto, Canada. That's where I was, that's where I grew up. My parents are there. So it's really the first time my kids are seeing their grandparents. And everyone's really excited about it. This morning my wife and I We sent our three kids to kindergarten, then we went to the hospital so I could do some blood work. I have high blood pressure. I turned 50 next year, so my wife is very anxious about my health. And then after the hospital, I checked the news and Israel is attacking Iran. So, my previous videos have said that this would happen, but I am surprised by the accelerated timeline. It seems we're headed towards World War 3 far faster and far harder than I could ever imagine. So like everyone else, I'm just praying and hoping that things turn out for the best, but also preparing for the worst. So this is really the first time that I've had a chance to talk directly to you guys. So let me tell you about myself, why I'm teaching this course, and what my plans are for the future of this class. So I was born in China in 1976 but when I was six my family and I immigrated to Toronto Canada and my family was poor but I worked really hard and I got a full scholarship to go to Yale University and I was really thankful to my teachers and the opportunity to empower myself for education. So after I graduated from Yale with a degree in English Literature. I've returned to China and I've been ever since working in education, doing everything I could possibly do in order to promote education reform in China. And I've worked various capacities. I've obviously worked as an English teacher, but I've also worked as a principal, curriculum director, a teacher trainer. I've worked in all levels of education in China, kindergarten, primary school, junior high, high school, university as well. Three years ago I got hired at this school that I'm at now, a private school in Beijing that helps students go abroad. And I first came in actually as a curriculum director overseeing the humanities curriculum at the school, which is what I specialize in. But the school needed teachers because of COVID. It was really hard to recruit teachers back then. So I was teaching AP English and it was my first time teaching Advanced Placement English. I really didn't know what I was doing so I just thought that we would just read a lot of books. So the kids and I read Julius Caesar, Paradise Lost, Virginia Woolf, Don't Leave the Vine Comedy, The Iliad and the kids loved it and I love teaching it. So in the second year I built a great books program at the school and again it extremely successful. We read the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Iniad, the Bible, the Divine Comedy, and the kids loved it. But while teaching it, I recognized there's a problem. And the problem was the kids being Chinese had absolutely no historical context to work with. So this year I started to develop a new program which is the program that you've experienced, you've been experiencing for the last 60 classes. My goal this year was to teach entirety of human history from the Ice Age up until the American Empire which is what I taught yesterday. And again it's been great for for the kids and it's been great for me because it's really often an opportunity to think very deeply about history. Specifically, it's given me an opportunity to think about the possibilities of history. And over the course of teaching this course, I've decided that I want to create a new intellectual movement, a new sort of history, and I call it predictive history. The idea is that in the future, I hope that history is able to accomplish three major goals. The first goal is to connect the events of the past into a coherent story. Second is to help us understand, explain the present. And the third goal is to be able to predict the future. And I think that if what we teach across all three goals, then it must be true history. And I think if we have true history, then we humanity, the world, can better organize, better control our future. And that's my ambition. As you can imagine, I was deeply inspired by the works of Isaac Asimov. As a young boy growing up in Toronto, Canada, I didn't have that many friends, but I read a lot of books. And one of my favorite series was the Foundation series. And in it, Isaac Asimov proposed the idea of psychohistory, which is the idea that we can mathematically model the present and the past so as to predict the future. And that I think is what will be my future ambition moving forward. I want to build the intellectual foundations for the possibility of psycho-history. And that's my long-term thinking. So about this course, I initially uploaded the classes so that my students can review the lectures because these are Chinese students and their English is not that great. And there were a couple hundred subscribers initially and everyone was fantastic. I'm so thankful for these initial subscribers because they believed in me, they commented, valuable feedback and I try to interact with them as much as possible. This past month something odd happened. My channel just blew up. I went from like 300 subscribers at the beginning of May to about 20,000 as we speak right now and it's constantly growing and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive so thank you so much for subscribing, for liking, for commenting. I try to read every comment but as you can imagine this is so many comments and I would like to respond to every one of them but again there's so much going on in my life. I have three young kids that I have to take care of with my wife. I also have to prep for classes and because I have three young kids I've been sick a lot. It's allergy season in China. COVID's still going strong so I'm trying my best right now to take care of my kids. So my apologies if I don't respond. I will try to respond over the summer but again I'm so thankful for all the support, all the positive feedback that I've received recently. So I finished teaching the course yesterday, 60 classes, coming the entire span of human history. And a lot of you are curious as to what the plans are moving forward. Well, tomorrow I'm going back to Toronto to rest, recuperate, relax. It's also, the summer is also a really good time for me to reflect on what I've taught and how I can improve the course. I also will be doing a lot of reading. Some of you have suggested Emil Todd, which I will go into deeply this summer. I will also look at Oswald Spangler very carefully. Some of you have commented that I'm very weak in terms of philosophy. Marx, Hegel, Kant are pretty weak. I'm pretty weak at. And I admit that. So this summer I will try to brush up on my philosophy. I also need to study economics in depth as well. So Adam Smith and other economists, because that really right now is the weak point in my analysis. I don't have enough cash flow economics in my background to fully comment on what's happening economically in the world. So that's my plan. When I return to Beijing in May and August, I'll be teaching a new iteration of this course. So rather than 60 classes, I'll try to cramp everything into 30 classes. Now some of you have bravely watched all 60 classes. I guarantee you in this new series, you'll be really impressed and you'll really enjoy it. I'm going to add tons of new material and I'm going to make the themes much more salient, much more coherent so that you can see the underlying structures of human history much more clearly. second semester which starts in February will be a lot of fun. Second semester I'll be teaching geopolitics. So what I'll be doing is I'll be looking at current events, trying to analyze why these events are happening and making predictions about what will happen. So the second semester will be a lot of fun. Some of you are really enjoying this channel and I'm so grateful that you are. And don't worry. I love being able to teach to a global audience and I'm going to keep on doing this for as long as I can. Some of you may be curious as to what my long term ambitions are. Well, as I said, I have three kids and I love teaching and I really want to develop a cycle history to its fullest possibility. So my long term ambition is actually to set up my own school that specializes in the teaching of the liberal arts, of the humanities and build the foundations for psycho history. I want this school to be the best ever. I want this to be Plato's Academy. I want this to be the Jedi Temple where I'm training the intellectual Jedi's of the future. These will be the future intellectuals, the future writers, the future historians of humanity. And I hope that we together, when we build this community, we'll be able to lead humanity forward. And that's really my ambition. So again, thank you so much for watching my lectures. I'm really thankful. Some of your comments have really made a deep impression on me and they're gonna really help me improve the course for next year. So I promise you that I will offer a much more lean, much more clean, much more enjoyable viewing experience in September. I will also try as best as I can to fix my hair because I know that's been a concern for a lot of you. Okay, so enjoy your summer. I'm going to engage in the process of deep reflection and deep learning, deep reading this summer so that in September, in the fall, I can deliver the best quality content I can to everyone. Because I'm so grateful to everyone for watching. Okay, well, that's it for me. for me, enjoy your summer and I will see you in mid August."}

So today this morning we are doing the Renaissance Specifically we are asking the question how the Renaissance how did the Renaissance start? because the Renaissance was a was an intellectual revolution in Europe that would ultimately change the fate of Europe. Okay guys The Renaissance was a reimagining of classical Greece in a Christian-European context. So what the Renaissance is going to do is combine classical Greece with Christian Europe and it's going to create modernity. So the ideas, the values that underpin modernity, the world we live in today, starts with the Renaissance. Okay, so the question we are looking at this morning is how did the Renaissance start? Okay, and there are lots of very different theories. And what scholars today believe is it was a perfect storm of cultural, historical, academic trends. Okay, so let's look at the main factors. The first is the decline of Constantinople. So for hundreds of years, Constantinople was the epicenter of European culture. It is the here to the Roman, Greco-Roman legacy. But as the Ottoman Turks start to encroach on Byzantine territory, a lot of the scholars, a lot of the major thinkers of the Byzantine Empire, they start to shift back to Europe. And they bring with them Plato, Aristotle. Okay? So that's one major factor. The Crusades. The Crusades, remember we discussed the last class, it was a time when Europeans encountered the Muslim world at mass. And as a result, they absorbed a lot of the culture and politics of the Islamic Golden Age. Then there was a fact that in Italy, you had many different city-states in competition with each other. And as we discussed in many classes before, when you have that, called open cooperative competition, which leads to innovation. Also, what's really important for us to remember is that because these city states were always at war with each other, everyone was a participant in history. Remember, if you are in an imperial bureaucracy, if you're a bureaucrat, you can sort of stand outside of history and observe history. But if you're a participant in history, then you are fighting wars. You're a participant in politics. Okay? You're always thinking about the relevance of your theory to reality. The three major city-states of Italy that will give rise to renaissance are Florence, Venice, and Genoa. Venice and Genoa are known for their slave trade. Okay? So they're trading slaves with the Muslim world. and through this trade, they're bringing back the books, the ideas, the values of the Islamic world into Europe. As well, because of this trade and commerce, these three cities become extremely wealthy that allows them to patronize the arts. So you have the rise of a merchant elite in Florence. The family is called the Medecis, okay? Why this is important is previous elites were either of the warrior class or the priest class. If you're a warrior class, you win your legitimacy by fighting the battlefield. If you're a priest, your legitimacy comes from God or the gods. But if you're an emerging elite, the question then is where does your legitimacy come from? And so because of this question, the Medesys are forced to patronize a lot of the arts. They will patronize individuals, including Da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, basically the major orders of the Renaissance. At this time, from 1305 to 1308, there are actually two popes in Europe. There's the crisis of legitimacy and authority in the Catholic Church. The pope moves to Avionon, and therefore the pope doesn't really have authority over Italy. You also have the rise of universities and monasteries. Universities and monasteries are places of theological debate and discussion. And they store the classics, and this is where a lot of new ideas will come from. And then the last factor to think about is in 1440, around then, a man named Gutenberg, he will invent the printing press. And the printing press allows for the rapid dissemination of literacy and knowledge. So what scholars believe is these various factors will coalesce into the Renaissance and Mark and the intellectual revolution in Europe. Now, the thing that you will remember about my teaching in this class is I disagree with scholarship. I think there's one factor that they're missing out, and it's the main factor in the creation of the Renaissance. I believe I will argue to you today that Dante, the divine comedy, is what ultimately sparked the Renaissance. While Dante, the Renaissance, this revolution would not have been possible. So this class, I'm gonna present you the scholarly mainstream argument, and then I will present my argument, which is that Dante is most responsible for the Renaissance. Okay? So a basic fact that we need to remember, if you look at all the major figures of the Renaissance, okay, including Raphael, Galileo, Boccaccio, Michelangelo, okay? The person who was born the earliest is actually Dante, actually Dante, okay, in 1265. So that is a good clue to suggest that perhaps it was Dante that sparked the Renaissance, that he's the secret sauce that made the Renaissance possible, okay? And throughout this class, I will make you this argument. But first let's just go over through the scholarly mainstream argument, okay? So first you remember that it's that before the Renaissance, Europe was connected with Africa, Asia, and the Middle East through these dense trade networks. As we discussed previously, the three main city-states that are involved in global trade are Venice, Genoa, and Florence. Venice and Genoa are the ones who benefit the most in this trade because they are by the coast and they're the ones that are most strategically located to benefit from this trade. And this trade, mainly slave trade actually, so Genoa and Venice will engage mainly in slave trade. Florence will not engage in slave trade, it will engage mainly in wool. So this is Venice and the slave trade made Venice extremely prosperous. This is Florence in around the 15th century. Okay, so one thing to remember about Italy at this point is that it is divided into warring city-states. And as a result, they're always in competition with each other. They're always at war with each other. And as we discussed previously, this scenario will drive innovation in Europe, mainly commercial innovation. By about the year 1000, as we discussed last class, Europe is now prosperous and they are engaging in commercial trade. The problem is how do you facilitate trade? So for example, if England has a lot of cotton and then France has a lot of bananas, what What if England doesn't want bananas? Well, England and France cannot trade with each other. So the only way to get around this is by creating a currency that everyone wants, and the currency that everyone wants is gold. So in Florence, they create something called the gold flora, which is the currency of Florence, but because it is so prestigious, because it's mainly gold, everyone wants it. And so the gold floren becomes the currency of European trade. And the family that most benefits from the status of the floren is the Medecic family. So this is Casomo, basically the founding patriarch of the family. And so what he will do is he will pull the resources of rich people in floren to create a bank. Meaning if you're a merchant you can borrow from the speck and what he will do is he will set up branches All throughout Europe in order to facilitate an underwrite European trade Okay, and obviously he gets a cut of all this trade and as a result the Medici family become tremendously Wealthy and they create the Medici dynasty from this family four popes will emerge Okay, four popes who emerge, they will eventually take over Florence and create their own monarchy. As we discussed, if you're a merchant family, you have a legitimacy problem. You didn't win the title, you didn't win your wealth on the battlefield, you don't represent God, all you have is a lot of money. So in order to legitimize themselves, they will go on a massive spending spree in order to make Florence the cultural capital of Europe. Okay, so they will, first of all, fund these massive, our cultural projects. The most famous church in Florence is called the Santa Maria di Forre. It's still there, you guys can still visit it. It's the fourth largest church in the world. It's absolutely stunning, okay? Here's another view of the church and the city of Florence. And it's still there today. you fly to Florence, you will still see this picture, okay? It is incredibly well preserved. This is what inside the church looks like, all right? They were also patronized artists. The most famous artists of this time were patronized by the Medici family. So Michelangelo actually lived with the Medici family for a while. And of course, he's most famous for a painting called The Creation of Adam, which we will discuss. The Creation of Adam is also famous for a statue of David. You also have Da Vinci, who is considered the archetypal Renaissance man. If you think of the Renaissance, you think of Da Vinci. So these are some of his paintings. He is a remarkable genius. He has what we call a polymath, which means that he dabbles, or he's interested in every single field of human knowledge. The sciences, philosophy, poetry, art, music, everything. And he takes all these different disciplines and combines them into his art. Okay, this is one of his most famous paintings, The Last Supper. And this painting I will show you is a work of genius. Okay, so later on we will actually discuss the last supper, but first I introduce it to you here. This is the School of Athens by Raphael, one of the most famous paintings in the world. You also have Father Celi, Donatello. And again, these are the most famous artists of the Renaissance, and the Meticis patronized every single one of them. Later on in this class, we'll actually discuss these paintings. But as the Medici are patronizing art and culture in Florence, the printing press is being invented by Gutenberg in Germany. And the printing press, it marks a revolution of literacy in Europe. This is a picture of what a printing shop looks like. So think about this. So the printing press first arrived in Venice in 1469. Only 30 years later, there are 417 printing presses in the city. Think of these as publishing houses. In the first 50 years, there are 20 million volumes of books that are printed in Europe. So the printing press is a revolution of literacy and knowledge in Europe that democratizes knowledge. Everyone now has access to Plato, Aristotle, the Bible. And what they're reading are some of the major thinkers of the Renaissance. So in terms of poetry, there are three major poets. There's Dante, there's Petrarch, and there's bocaccio. You also have Niccolò Machiavelli, who we still read today. His most famous work is called The Prince. The Prince is really one of the first political treatises in the world. The question then is how do you best govern a state? Today we remember the Prince for its strategy, for its almost was a moral strategy on how to rule a state. What we need to remember is that McAvelli himself during his time, he was a startling Democrat. He believed that the people needed to have a say over the fears of Florence. And as a result, he came into contact with the Medici's who tortured him, okay? But he wrote the print in order to raise awareness about politics. He believed that if we are to have a world functioning republic, then everyone needs to understand how politics works. And then you also have from Florence, Galileo, who we will discuss next week. He is the father of science. So these are the major thinkers of the Renaissance. The philosophy, the value system that underpins all this artistic production is the idea of humanism. Okay? So, what is humanism? And how is it different from Christianity? Okay? So, these are the three major differences, guys. Okay? So, let's look at them. If you're a Christian, the Catholic Church for the longest time struggled with what is the nature, what is the idea of God. Okay? And human is concerned with what is the story of humans. Do you guys understand? This is the major revolution in the intellect brought on by the Renaissance. A transition from a focus on ideas to a focus on stories. Second major difference is Christians always ask, how do I save my soul? How do I ensure that I go to heaven? But humanists ask, how do I flourish? How do I make the most out of my talents? How do I have the best possible life on earth? So the Greek word is eudaimonia. So humanism is actually a return to the values and belief systems of classical Greece. The last major difference is Christians are always asked, how can we best serve God? can we best obey God? But humanists ask, how do we achieve goodness? How do we make the world we live in today beautiful and truthful? Okay? So these are the three major differences that separate Christians from humanists. And what this world and what humanism will represent is a radical reorientation of focus from the afterworld into the here and now. Christians care about what happens in heaven, humanists care about what happens today. How do we make the most out of today? How do we make the world a better place? Does that make sense to you guys? So having said that, let's understand concretely how this transition happened. It happened mainly through art. So the main transition to emphasize is a transition from a focus on ideas to a focus on stories. So what do I mean by that? Okay, let's look at some classical Greek sculptures. If you look at some Greek sculptures, the thing that stands out is the motion, the the tension, the emotion in the sculptures, right? There's a story being told. You can almost feel that this person is alive and thinking. You can almost go into this person's character. It's a story. This sculpture is actually even more obvious, right? Within the sculpture, there's a story taking place. It's almost like you're watching a movie. And what your mind does when it's looking at the sculpture, when it is in conversation with the sculpture, it is imagine what happens before and after. You are making the sculpture alive with your imagination. So that's classical Greece. By the time we hit medieval Christianity, the very concept of art changes. It becomes more of an idea. So this is from the Carol legion Renaissance. So basically the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire. And as you can see, the artwork, it's much more static. Okay, there's not really a story here. What's being conveyed to you is an idea. You don't really have to imagine what's going on because there's really no space for you to imagine what's going on. So the main artwork during the medieval Christian period are stained glass windows. So you go inside a church and you see pictures on the windows. And what these are are almost like visual aids. So when the priest is talking about the stories of the Bible, he's using these pictures to illustrate his point. Because remember at this point, most people are illiterate. Because of these stained glass windows, the effect that is created in the observer is blinding and awesome. Remember, these are windows and they're high up in the church. So the light is coming through. It makes the pictures wholly illuminated with light. It's awesome. You're forced to send back. But it's also blinding. Blinding just means that it's hard for you to imagine what's going on. The purpose of this artwork is to make you submit before the power of God for you understand the awesomeness of God. Does that make sense? You're not here to participate, you're here to submit. So as you can see, this is a church. You can see how the light comes in and it blinds you. And it's hard for you to really participate in the artwork. So this is the idea of medieval Christianity. The idea that through artwork you are trying to represent the eternity, the awesomeness, the mystery that is God. All right? By the time we hit the Renaissance, the attitude is completely different. Okay? This is the Vinci's, the Last Supper. And from Blinding and Awesome we go to Compelling and Curious. What this means is compelling means that you are drawn into the picture. All right? Why? Because of death, okay? Meaning the picture moves backwards and it moves forwards. And because of this motion, you are drawn into the picture. Look at this table, right? Look at this table. It's not a complete table. It's too much too small for 13 people to eat. It's much too thin, right? So what your eye believes is this table is expanding outwards and so you are part of this picture. Does that make sense? Okay? And also it's curious because clearly within this picture there's a lot of tension. You see how these different groups are in discussion, okay? And they're all focus on Jesus. So this is the picture, the artwork of the Last Supper. In the Last Supper, which appears in the Bible, Jesus reveals that someone has betrayed them. There's someone, his name is Judas Eskerid, he has betrayed them and the next day, Jesus will be arrested and he will be crucified. And once Jesus announces this, everyone becomes anxious. Is it me? Is it me? Am I the betrayer? Okay, there's a lot of tension in this picture. And as you can see, it's a radical departure. This very painting is a radical departure from medieval Christian art. If you look at previous medieval Christian art, okay, below, first of all, it's much more static, it's much more organized, there's not that much tension in the picture and what's most important is the idea of holiness. You see this halo surrounding each person in the picture, right? It shows you that these are divine figures. What Lionel Devanchi has done, which is very important, is he's really taking out the humanity in the picture. There are no what's left is the humanity. These are first and foremost humans, not divine figures. So this is another picture previously. So there's much more detail, but as you can see, not as much tension, not as much drama as in Da Vinci's. And this is the most recent. This is the most recent. Now in this artwork, Judas Ascariot stands out from the rest. And so that signals him as the betrayer. But in Da Vinci's work, it's obvious who is the betrayer. Everyone is afraid that he or she is the betrayer. And what this does is it forces you to investigate. It forces you, the observer, to observe the details. in order to figure out who is who. All right? What's amazing about this picture is the focus on human anatomy, facial expressions, right? You see the tensions in the neck. You see the hand gestures. So what Da Vinci believed is that the hands, the hand motions, they are a window into the soul of a person. Okay, if you want to understand how a person thinks, You see how he or she uses the hands. You can see how the hands are all in different motions which signifies different personalities, different thoughts inside that person. Again, you're forced to investigate. You can see the anxiety, the stress, the drama in each of the faces. So the Vinci was first and foremost an astute observer of emotions, okay? How emotions are expressed through the face, through body tension, through breathing, through the eyes. The man who is ultimately responsible for the betrayal is Judith Eskerit. And you can see how Dante sublimely, sorry, with subtlety emphasizes his betrayal, right? So you can see how he's darker than the other individuals. So he's turning away from the light. He's betrayed God by turning away from the light. Also, in his hand, he's clutching some silver coins. And you can see his neck. His neck has been emphasized, wiping all the tension in his neck. He can't breathe. Everyone else is anxious. you're talking, but he cannot bring himself to talk. So all the tension is captured in his neck. So you see all the subtlety here. Something really fun about The Last Supper is, it becomes the basis for a very famous book called The Da Vinci Code. And The Da Vinci Code is a very popular book, no scholarship, it's just made for entertainment. What it argues is that Jesus did not die, sorry, Jesus died, but before he died, he married his lover, who is Mary Magdalene, okay? And so this picture becomes one of the sources for the book. So previously scholars have believed that this person is one of the apostles. But when you look at him, it turns out it's almost a she, right? And if you look at how Jesus and this person, it's station, it creates an M shape. An M can mean married. But it stands for their closeness together. So people speculate that these two are married. And by doing this, what Thane is really emphasizing is the humanity of Jesus. Jesus is first and foremost a human. So this is interesting, guys. Scholars don't really agree with this analysis, but it becomes the basis of the Da Vinci Code, which is a really fun book. Something that scholars do believe is the mathematics. So if you look at where the hands and the bread are, and you map it onto a music sheet, you can actually play the music. It's designed to be musical. Also look at the configuration. It's a 3, 3, 1, 3, 3 configuration. It turns out, if you look at the Bible and you look for the passage 33, 1, 33, you get this quotation in Lamentations, in the Bible. It says, For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion. So great is his unfailing love, for he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone. And so the idea here is that God will always love you. God is love. God is incapable of hating you. He will always find a way to forgive you. And if you remember from last semester, this is the very idea of the divine comedy. Leonardo da Vinci is getting this idea from Dante. And this idea is the backbone of the Last Supper. Jesus knows he's been betrayed by Judas Iscariot. But look at him, okay? Let's go back and look at him. He's calm. He's we assured he's already forgiven Judas Iscariot. There's no hatred in him. There's no anger. The anger and the hatred is everyone else. So that's the last supper. And as you can see it is heavily influenced by Dante. This is the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa. It has captured the imagination of millions of people. Millions of people Every year we'll go to friends, the Lou to stand in line just so they can spend 10 seconds to look at this picture. What makes this picture remarkable is it's secretly alive. When you've done it, spent 16 years crafting this in a way that by just talking with it, by moving around in conversation with it, it becomes alive. So when you just look at it directly, Mona Lisa isn't really doing anything. She's just smiling. Sorry, she's neutral in her expression, right? But if you turn away from her, what happens is this. What happens is she starts off a smile, okay? She starts off a smile. So your eyes play tricks on you. When you move away from the picture, what happens is your peripheral revision still picks up the picture, but the expression is different, okay? So this is the central version, we just look at her directly, but as you move further away from her, she smiles, okay? So what's this thing? What this is saying is the art is alive if you engage with it, okay? Art is not meant to be blinding and awesome. It's meant to be here and now. Only if participate in the art doesn't become a lie. Only when it becomes a lie does it achieve its true meaning. Okay? So this is the modern Lisa. All right, let's look at the School of Athens by Raphael. The actual name for this painting is actually not School of Athens. It's actually called philosophy. And the reason why is it was commissioned by Pope Julius II of the Vatican in order to decorate his papal apartments. So we go inside his papal apartments today. There are four major frescoes, paintings. The first is called philosophy, and then right beside philosophy is called religion. So religion and philosophy balance each other out. They are dependent on each other. And then across the wall are two more paintings, poetry and law. All right? So that's the very ideal of the Renaissance, open-mindedness, exploration, and holistic learning. All right, so let's look at this painting. First of all, the very center are two figures, Plato and Aristotle. How do we know? Because you're holding two books. This is a Timius by Plato, where he discusses the realm of the forms. Remember before in class, we discussed Platonic philosophy, right? and how Plato conceptualizes heaven. God is a form of the good, and then form of the good will emanate concepts, truth, beauty, justice, which will then give rise to perfect forms. Okay? And so this is argued in his book, Timius. Aristotle, his most famous book is called Ethics, How to Lead a Good Life. What's amazing about this picture is you can see that these two are having a debate. So first thing is Plato is pointing upwards. What he's saying is the real world, what matters is heaven. And what Aristotle is saying is no, what matters is down here on earth. Aristotle is concerned about earthly matters. Also look at their colors. So Plato is wearing white and red. White symbolizes ear, red symbolizes fire. These are spiritual colors. But Aristotle is wearing blue, which signifies water. And then he's also wearing brown, which signifies the earth. So there's this debate. And this debate is, as we discussed previously, It is what underpins the debate within Western philosophy even today. Okay? Now, what's amazing is that as the two are walking, alright, they're splitting the world into two, right? There are those philosophers who support Aristotle and they focus on earthly matters. And then there are people who support Plato who focus on spiritual matters, on discovering the secrets of the universe. Alright? Aristotle is concerned about everyday science on uncovering the secrets of a reality. Okay, so they're split into two. And as you can see, there's depth to this painting. There's a sky to the back, there are these arches. And so it's extending forward, and so we're being drawn into the picture. That's a power of depth and perception. This is Pythagoras. You will know him from Pythagoras theorem. But he's first and foremost a spiritualist. He's concerned about mysticism. He's concerned about God. This is Euclid, who is the one of the inventors of geometry. And here he's focused on using science, using logic, using deduction to teach his students. You also have in the picture many different personalities. you have Zoroaster who is the founder of Zoroastrianism, the religion of Persia. You have Ptolemy who investigated how the planets move. And as you can see, Zoroaster, can you see this picture clearly? Okay, this is more clear. Zoroaster is concerned with the heavens, with spiritual matters. Ptolemy is concerned with the earth, with all reality. So this is Raphael acknowledging that there are two different realities. There's the material reality, but then there's also a spiritual reality, and they're both important. Now what's amazing here is that Raphael, this is Raphael actually, this is self-portrait of Raphael, he will actually engage in the conversation. He will listen in. He will insert himself in the painting. Now remember that Christianity focuses on the idea of humility, on self-negation, are removing yourself from the world. But Raphael is reinserting himself into the world and celebrating his curiosity, celebrating his humanity. Okay? And where does he get this idea from? From Dante, right? Because Dante makes himself the hero of divine comedy. He makes himself the focus of the divine comedy. And to go back to the conversation between Plato and Aristotle, Look at this, okay? This is a visual representation of the divine comedy. Because remember, in the divine comedy, Virgil and Dante are engaged in a vigorous debate about the nature of love, about the nature of sin, right? Okay? So this is representing the divine comedy. The structure is the same as the divine comedy. They're also, as they walk from purgatory, from infernal to purgatory, They're also talking to other historical figures as well. So this is directly inspired by Dante. Does this make sense to you guys? Okay, so this is Raphael. So now when Raphael insert himself into the picture, he also inserts his friend Michelangelo. This is Michelangelo. Michelangelo is known for being reclusive. He's known for not enjoying the company of others. And Michelangelo here is completed with another historical figure, a philosopher named Heraclitus, who is also known for not enjoying the company of others. Okay, so this picture just shows you the immense diversity of human thought and human personality. It's a sub-subwayion of what it means to be human. So these paintings leave us with a fundamental question. All right? We can now see the radical differences between Christian art and Renaissance art. So another question then is, how did Dante spark the confident self-exploration and tri-imprint self-expression of the Renaissance? If you look at the art, it is confident. It is tri-imprint. It's celebrating what it means to be human. And what I will show you now is, what he will do is he will reimagine our relationship with God, which is a fundamental question of Europe at this time. Okay, so most people, they're grappling with three major questions, especially intellectuals. The first question is, what is God? What is the idea? What is the nature of God? Some question is, what is the nature of the relationship between God and humans? What did God create us? What is our responsibility to God? And the last question is, how can we best worship God? Meaning how can we best ensure our divinity? How can we best ensure that we will rise to heaven? Alright, so these are the three fundamental questions underlying Christian society at this point. So you can take these three questions and just ask one question really, which is, why did Jesus have to die? Why was Jesus crucified? is the crucification. Why is it that the Son of God, the Messiah, had to die? And this idea was first understood and discussed by Paul. Paul's idea is this, God created us and gave us paradise. This is Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. But because we were arrogant because we were proud. We want to become God. We want to eat that food from the tree of knowledge. Which would make us like God. And because we disobeyed God, God had no choice but to banish us from the garden of Eden. Okay? And so why did Jesus have to come to earth and sacrifice himself? Because without God, we humans can only commit more and more sin. So to redeem us and to beg for forgiveness from God, Jesus came down and sacrificed himself. And it sacrificed, made God relent and forgive us. And so now we are cleansed of our sins and now we can begin anew. That's the idea that Paul is presenting. Why Jesus is the Messiah and why he had to kill himself. The problem though is as Christianity grows and grows the divinity of Christ, the divinity of Jesus, expands. Before he was just a human who was favored by God, then became a son of God. But by the time of a man named Tertillian who lived about the second century he argued for the Holy Trinity, which is that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are separate but equal. Jesus is God. Okay? Now you have a problem now. If Jesus truly God, then why did God have to kill himself? We can understand if Jesus is a son of God, Jesus kills himself to beg for his father's forgiveness. That makes sense. All right? But if Jesus is God, then why did he have to kill himself? Okay? This is now causing a lot of confusion. So another Christian theologian by the name of Origen. Origen, okay, so this is the Trinity, right? By the name of Origen, his explanation is something called the ransom theory, all right? And the theory goes like this. When we were cast off from the government of Eden, we became subject to Satan, the devil. We became slaves to the devil. Remember it was Satan, the devil who tempted Eve to eat that food, right? And when she ate that fruit, she now swears allegiance to the devil. We are now slaves to the devil. We are now his property. So the only way for God to redeem us is by ransoming us from Satan, by offering something so valuable that Satan is willing to make a trade. Right? So what did God offer? God offered his life. The trick though is that God cannot be killed because God is eternal and perfect. So God tricked Satan. But what's really important to understand is this. Before we were slaves to Satan. But because God made this trade, we are now slaves to God. We are now slaves to God. And this very idea will be expanded and elaborated by Augustine in order to create with intellectual blueprint for the Catholic Church, this idea of the ransom theory. All right, so remember to see if God, Augustine will say certain things. It's really important for us to remember what he said in the city of God. The main idea is that because God ransomed us, we are now his slaves, and therefore we must obey him. We must submit. So let's go over what he says, Augustine. First thing he says is, when man lives by the standard of man, when we trust ourselves, when we use our imagination, when we use our intuition, and not by the standard of God, the standard of God is to submit to him, to obey him. He is like the devil, okay? You understand? When we use our imagination, when we use our intuition, we are like Satan. Our core is the essence of Satan. It is only by submitting ourselves to God that we are freed from the influence of Satan, okay? Could anything but pride happen at the start of the evil will? Why did we disobey God? Why did we eat that fruit? Because we want to become God. So there's an arrogance. There's a pride to us that is the essence of Satan. Satan fell from heaven because of his pride. If we just trust our nature, we will also fall like Satan. His was a video transcription when he refused to desert his life's companion even though the refusal entailed companionship in sin. was tempted by the devil. But Adam ate the fruit because of his love for Eve. Therefore, love can only misguide you. Love can only trick you. Love can only lead you to an evil path. Do not trust your intuition. Do not trust your imagination. But most importantly, do not trust your love of others, especially woman. The will derives its existence as a nature from its creation by God. It's falling away from its true being is due to its creation out of nothing. So why are we like the why are we like the devil? Why can't we trust ourselves? Because we were created out of dust. We were created out of nothing. If we're an angel, we're created by God and therefore we are perfect. But because we're created out of But, thus, we are inherently flawed. So we must not trust ourselves. We must refuse who we are. We must deny who we are and submit ourselves to the glory that is God. We see the two cities were created by two kinds of love. The earthly city was created by self-love, reaching the point of contempt for God. When we love ourselves, we disobey God. And that's what explains the world we live in today. Because world is evil because of our pride, because of our self-love, because of love for others. But the heavenly city by the love of God carried as far as contempt of self. When we deny who we are, when we submit fully to God, we can create a perfect world. We can achieve heaven. So again, this is the very idea for the Catholic Church, self-denial, self-negation. Now you can think about this and understand now why the Islamic world raised the head of Europe because in Europe people were paralyzed. People were afraid to do anything because they couldn't really trust themselves. But eventually the contrast between the Islamic world and the European Christian world was so great that even the Catholic Church had to admit there were problems with the theology of Augustine. If you ask people to deny who they are and to submit themselves completely to the power of the church, it leads to corruption, stagnation, and inequality. So there are some major reforms undertaken by the church in response to this. One major reform are the creation of the university system. So this is the University of Paris which is is charted in 1200. This today is called the Suborn, which is the most famous university in France and in Europe, basically. One of the most famous professors of theology at the University of Paris is Thomas Aquinas. And Thomas Aquinas, he's a saint in the Catholic Church. His importance is he's trying to revise Augustine for a Europe in conflict with Islam. What he's really trying to do is he's trying to take the pure, platonic world of Augustine and combine it with Airstallian science and logic and reason. He's trying to combine faith and reason. So he's trying to update the Catholic Church. But ultimately, he doesn't succeed. And the reason why is people don't really understand what he's trying to do. Also, Augustine has been in power for centuries, and so he's really become part of the culture, the milieu of Europe. He's in the air, you breathe. That's the power of culture. The man who will ultimately free Europe from the grasp of Augustine is actually Dante. And Dante will do so by first poetry. First poetry, he's going to reimagine the human relationship with God. So in the line of comedy, he will make certain assertions. The first major assertion is this. Okay guys, let's read together. The greatest gift to the magnanimity of God, as he created, gave the gift most suited to his goodness, give that he most prizes was the freedom of the will. So what this is saying is this, when God created us to show his generosity, to show that he is perfect, to show his goodness, He gave us the gift that only God can give us, the gift that he most prizes, which is the freedom from him. You are of God, but now you are free of God. You can do whatever you want. So that's one of the central ideas of the Divine Comedy that what makes us fundamentally human is freedom of the will, that we can choose the life we lead. All right, so let's study the Divine Comedy. This is going to be Canto 7 of Paradise. And in this Canto, Beatrice, remember they're both in heaven, Beatrice and Dante are engaged in an intellectual discussion. The question that they're trying to figure out is why did Jesus have to kill himself? Okay? Remember before Paul suggested it was to redeem us from the original sin and then Orgene suggested the idea of the ransom theory. God had to redeem us, ransom us from Satan. Now what Donate is going to do is he's going to propose a new theory. And this new theory is going to radically reimagine our relationship with God. So let's look at this very closely. You say, this is Beatrice talking to Donate, what I've heard is clear to me, but this is hidden from me. Why God willed precisely this pathway for redemption? Okay, God wants to save us, but why did God have to kill himself? That's the question here. That makes no sense. If you're non-Christian, it's almost impossible to explain to someone else who is not a Christian why Jesus had to die. It makes no sense. Brother, this ordinance is buried from the eyes of everyone whose intellect has not matured within the flame of love. This impetus is making this argument which is like, you can only understand this if you truly love someone. It's only through love that you can acquire wisdom. You can acquire empathy and imagination. The godly goodness that has banished every envy from its own self burns in itself and sparkling soul it shows eternal beauties. Remember last time we discussed the nature of God. God is love itself. There can be no hate, there can be no envy, there can be no blemishes within the nature of God. All that derives directly from this goodness is everlasting, since the seal of goodness impresses an imprint that never alters. So God, when God creates, what he creates is also perfect. Only men sin unknown, man's liberty, makes him unlike the highest good so that in him the brightness of his light is dimmed. So God is in us. God is the light that burns in us and allows us to love others. We love others, the brightness burns brighter. The light burns brighter. That's how we celebrate God by loving others. We also have the freedom of the will. So these are the two things that God has given us. Freedom to choose, freedom to lead the lives we want to live, and as well as the power to love and to imagine. But these things come into conflict when we choose to do too bad. When we choose to disobey, when we choose to commit sin, we are turned away from God and therefore dampening the brightness in us. Okay? We are purposely stuffing out the flame in us. And man cannot regain his dignity unless where sin left emptiness, man fills that void with just amends for evil pleasure. So when we commit sin, you must make amends. You must force yourself. You must choose to go on a proper path and make amends. But for when your nature sins so totally, when it's seed, then from these dignities, just as from paradise, that nature parted. Sometimes you could commit a sin that's so terrible the light leaves you. And that's when we disobeyed God in the garden of Eden. That sin, the original sin, was so terrible that Adam doomed all his progeny to darkness. And they could never be regained if you consider carefully by any way that did not pass across one of these two forts. So how do we forgive? How do we ask for forgiveness? There are possibilities. Either through nothing other than his mercy God had to pardon man or of himself men had to proffer payment for his father. Okay so there are two ways for us to get that light back in us to redeem ourselves in the eyes of God. The first way is if God just forgives us. If God says I'm total I'm perfect I'm total perfectness I forgive you because that's what I do I forgive you to show mercy. That's one possibility. But when he does that, the problem is we've learned nothing. We haven't grown. Okay? Another possibility is if we figure out a way to redeem ourselves, if we make amends, if we give God all the gold in the world. Okay? But because our crime was so great, because we denied the love of God, nothing we do, there's nothing we could give God that would redeem us from our sin. That's a conflict here, that's a paradox. God cannot forgive us because if he did so, we would not grow and learn. And there's nothing we can do to redeem ourselves in the eyes of God because our crime was so great. So that's the paradox. Man's limits could not recompensate for no obedience, no humility he offered later could have been so deep that it could match the heights he meant to reach through disobedience. Men lack the power to offer satisfaction by himself. We want to kill God. That was the original sin. We wanted to eat that fruit, become God, and then kill God, and become God itself. That's the greatest crime. So how can you redeem yourself? How can you ask for forgiveness if the crime is to kill God? For God so great a generosity in giving his own self that men might be able to rise than if he's simply part of it. So for thousands of years, God had to think of a way to redeem us, forgive us, but at the same time ensure we would not do anything like this ever again. And the path he chose was to sacrifice himself. For every other means fell short of justice except the way whereby the Son of God humbled himself when he became incarnate. Okay? So I'm going to use a metaphor to explain this idea. It's a very, it's not a great metaphor, but I think this will illustrate what Beatrice is saying here about God. Let's just say I have a daughter named Eve. I have a favorite dog named Johnny. I love Johnny and I love Eve. I love both, okay? I say to Eve, Johnny is my favorite dog. You're my favorite, favorite daughter. I love you both. Eve, because she's young and she's stupid, she decides, I only want my father to love me. So Eve purposely kills my dog, Johnny. All right? Now, what do I do? I'm Eve's father. If I just say Eve, don't worry about it, you're young, it was a mistake, Eve is probably gonna go hurt someone else, right? I have to teach her a lesson. But if I hit her, or I punish her, then that might suggest to Eve, I don't really love her. It doesn't make sense. That's a paradox here. That's a conflict. And so what I choose to do after many weeks of intense thinking is I choose to punish myself on behalf of Eve, okay? I take a bat and I hit myself or I take a whip and I hit myself and then my hand is bleeding and Eve watches this. You can see that when Eve sees this, She has to cry. She has to cry and feel remorse for what she did. And she also cries because she knows I truly love her. Okay? So that's what Beeshees is saying here. God loves us so much that he's willing to everything in order to teach us to be better human beings. Okay? That's the power of God. All right. All right. So the conversation continues And this story makes sense, but it's also going to create a lot of problems. Okay, one major problem is if God created us and God loves us, why are we making mistakes? Why are we dying? Why are we in pain? And this is what Beecher says. You say, I see that water, see that fire and air and earth and all that they compose come to corruption and endur so briefly. Okay? There's death, there's dying, there's pain, there's suffering. Why is that? And yet these two were things created if what has been said above is true, then these things never should be subject to corruption. If whatever God creates is perfect, then things shouldn't die. All right? Brother, the angels in the pure country where you are now, these may be said to be created as they are and all their being. Okay? Yes, it is true that God created everything in this world, but there's a problem, there's a difference. Whereas the elements that you have mentioned, as well as those things that are made from them, receive their form from a creative power, the matter they contain had been created, just as within the stars that wheel around them, the power to give form had been created. The rays and motion of the holy light draw forth the soul of every animal and plant from matter able to take form. So what this is saying is this, God did not create animals and plants. God created the laws of the universe. He created the atoms, the essence that would give rise to animals and plants. And so they're not perfect, okay? The laws are perfect. The holy light is perfect, but not the creation from the holy light. And this creation was meant to die so that new creations can come out, okay? right? When an animal dies, the atom is break away and then a new form comes into being. That's the law of the universe. So that's perfect, but not the animals and plants are perfect. But your life is briefed forth immediately by the chief good who so enamors it of his own self that it desires him always. So another question then is, if animals and plants aren't perfect, what are humans then? So this is what she says. So recently, you can also can deduce your resurrection. You need but remember the way in which your human flesh was fashioned when both of the first parents were created. Okay, so this is the trick. You have to remember this. Animals and plants are created from the laws of the universe, which God created. Angels are created by God himself, and therefore the angels are perfect. We humans have a dual nature. We are both created from the laws of the universe. We are both created by God itself. All right? Because when God created Adam, God created him from out of dust, okay? But then what God did was breathe life into him. So the essence of God is within Adam and there for us. Our bodies are mortal, but our souls are immortal. Our souls have the essence of God, which is love. The more we love, the more the light burns in us. And as light burns in us, it will allow for our resurrection. Okay. Because the matter will regenerate. The soul is eternal. Okay. So that's what Dante is saying here. The best way to separate God is by loving others. When you love others, you're activating your imagination. You're learning wisdom. You're gaining experience, and that will only cause the light to grow, okay? So even though going back to the story of Eve and my dog, even though I'm hurting myself, okay? I am using my tremendous imagination in order to come up with this plan in order to redeem my daughter. And because of this imagination, I'm developing wisdom and this light in me grows stronger. All right. So that's the purpose of life. The purpose of life is to celebrate God by separating God in you, by loving someone else. So wholeheartedly that your imagination, your wisdom grows and grows so that your soul becomes eternal. When it becomes eternal, it will always be resurrected in the world. and your soul will remember the love inside you and it will continue to grow and grow. This is why God created us. Because if you're perfect, okay? If you're perfect, you are incapable of imagination by definition, right? Because you can make no mistakes. Because we are the dual nature, we are both body and soul, we can make mistakes, we can err. And in this process, we develop experience and wisdom, which allows us to love and have imagination and to have wisdom, all right? All right. So let me use an everyday example that you've experienced in order to illustrate this point. Let's think about two teachers. A teacher who loves his or her students and a teacher who does not love his or her students. What's the difference? All right, so there are three major differences. The teacher who loves students is asking himself or herself, are my students learning in my class? Are they growing as people? Whereas another teacher might be like, are my students getting good grades? All he or she cares about are test scores, right? That's the first major difference. The first teacher who loves you cares about what is happening inside you. The teacher who doesn't love you only cares about pleasing parents. Okay? Second difference is this. A teacher loves you are asking are my students working hard? Okay? Because only by working hard can you learn. The second teacher is asking students, do students like me? Okay? This teacher wants you to write a good evaluation at the end of semester. Okay? Right? And then if you write a good evaluation, the teacher might get a raise or some reward. Right? And then the last difference, and this is the most important difference, is this. A good teacher who loves you is always asking, am I growing personally and professionally? Am I growing as a person? All right? Because if you're growing, then I'm growing. And if I'm growing, then you're growing. That's the power of love. When you love others, you're actually loving yourself. And that's how God designed it. But if you're a teacher who does not love, then you're always asking, how much money am I making? That's how you measure your success in life. Am I making a lot of money? If I'm making millions of dollars a year, then that means I'm the best teacher in China. But a really good teacher who's capable of love, who loves teaching and who loves his or her students is always asking, am I growing? Because if I'm growing, then I know my students are growing. So that's what Dante is saying here about love. Meaning that we have the intuition with the power to know true for ourselves because God made us this way. Okay, so something I want you to remember from this class is the Italian Renaissance was really Just another it's it's reimagining the Greek civilization Okay, and as and these are the two major periods of tremendous creativity in Western Europe All right, so let's look at the similarities to understand how creativity happens in civilization Okay, so the first similarity is classical Greece had open cooperative competition. Okay, so ideas could flow freely. That's the first major similarity. Second major similarity is in classical Greece, they transitioned from linear B, which is very complicated, ideographic language to the alphabet. Okay, the alphabet just transcribed the spoken word into the written word. This allows for massive literacy and a transfusion of knowledge in Greece. The idea here is if you're truly to be a creative society, you must be egalitarian. You must allow anyone to learn, everyone to express his or her ideas, which is what the Renaissance did. The Italian Renaissance was supported by the fact that they transitioned from Latin to the vernacular, the spoken language. It was Dante who allowed the transition to happen. Dante purposely chose not to write in Latin, even though Latin was the official language of the intellectual class in Europe at this time, he purposely chose to write in Tuscan, which is a local language. Because he did that, he made Tuscan, first of all, the official language of Italy, they still speak it today, but it also makes the line comedy accessible to common people, which was the intention. And the third similarity, and this is the most important, is the perfect storm of factors don't really matter unless you have a great poet, a great thinker, a great intellectual to create the spark to ignite your civilization. So in Greece, they had Homer. And today, we can think of Homer as the father of civilization. In the entire Renaissance you had Dante. You can think of him as the father of modernity. The values that he creates, the values that he expresses in the Divine Comedy will become the basis for modernity, especially the idea of individuality, of humanism. An individual is someone who celebrates himself and pursues his or her periocity to explore the world and his process creates goodness in the world, great truth and beauty. This is the idea that I will underpin the renaissance and which still underpins Western modernity today. So that is my argument to you. So the ultimate message, the ultimate secret of the universe, I want you to remember, both Homer and Dante expressed this in the poetry is this. Love is the unifying force of the universe. Love is God. God is love. It's what unites everyone. By loving someone else, you can become that person. That person can become you. And the imagination is the animating force. What gives life to the world is not God but our imagination. By imagining the world, the world becomes alive. So the greater our imagination, the more alive our imagination becomes. And this idea is most visually expressed in the painting, The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo. Okay? This is Michelangelo, The Creation of Adam. And so this goes back to the story of how God created Adam. God created Adam out of dust and he breathed the essence of life into Adam. Okay? Now, there are two ways of looking at this painting. Okay? There are two ways of understanding the title, the creation of Adam. You can first understand it in the typical way, which is that God created Adam and that they are equals. Okay? You can see that these two worlds, the Adam and God, they're almost equal. We are equal to God. But then you can change perspective and you can say the creation of Adam really means God is Adam's creation. God is what we created from our imagination. Now, you can see God is surrounded by his angels. But you take them away, and what do you have behind them? Guys, this is a picture of the human brain. You see this? This is a stem, and this is the human brain. You take them away, and hidden behind is the human brain, which means what? which means that God is an emanation from our imagination. Okay? Not the true God. The true God is like light itself, right? Love itself, okay? But this God has given us a capacity to imagine. So we've imagined another God to take place of the real God. Okay? Do you understand? So the real God is a human imagination. The human brain, the human mind. That's what gives life to the universe, okay? So this, if you think about it, it is a radical revolution in human intellectual history. You guys, do you know where this painting is? This painting is on the top of something called the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. It's at the very heart of the Catholic Church. So what Dunning has been able to do is destroy an empire peacefully for the power of poetry, through subtlety, through the power of love. Donnie was able to influence Michelangelo, was able to take his ideas and then plant his ideas within the very heart of the Catholic Church and thus reinvent the Catholic Church. That is the power of love, that is the power of the imagination. All right, great. Okay, any questions? Okay, so think of some questions. Next class, we will do the Protestant Reformation, okay?"}

Okay, and let's follow follows the killing, the assassination of their general Qassam Salamani in 2020, right? This is when the Americans launched a strong strike against him in Baghdad, and he was really the top, one of the top Iranian generals. And what both of these incidents show us is that the Americans, and they really have dominance over Iran, okay? So military dominance. So the first thing is they have technology, right? So, technologically, America and Israel are so much superior to Iran. So that there's a jet that went from Israel and went to Damascus to carry out the strike. Now, if you did the research, you would know that the Canadian Embassy is right next to the Iranian Embassy. And the strike was so precise that it only hit the Iranian embassy and didn't touch anything else. Okay? That's a precision strike. That's how powerful the technology that the Americans and Israelis have. Okay? But the other thing that's important is the idea of intelligence. So how do the Israelis know that these commanders would be there at that time, right? That's intelligence. And intelligence comes in two forms, right? There's the idea of human and then signals. Signals is basically, I can listen in on your cell phone. I can track where you go. I know where your car is, right? That's signals and electronic intelligence. There's human. So there are spies in the embassy who tell the Israelis that this meeting will happen. So this is clearly military dominance that Israel and Americans possess over Iran. And when this strike happened, as you know, the Iranians had to respond and this was called Operation True Promise. And the idea of True Promise was that there's a strike package consisting of 300 drones and missiles that hit Israel. Now, what they actually say is that 99% of these drones and missiles were intercepted. They caused no damage. And this really says, this shows that our iron dome system is amazing. We're amazing. Iran cannot touch us. What the Iranians said is that, no, we designed the attack to be harmless. We intentionally designed the attack so that it would not cause that much damage. Okay, so who's right? The Israelis or the Iranians? I wanna make an argument to you today that the Iranians are more believable, more credible. Okay, and the reason why is that the Iranians have to be very strategic in the response to the Americans and the Israelis. And the reason why is the Americans in the Israelis have military dominance over Iran. But just because you have military dominance does not mean you will win the war. So what I believe is that Iran and Israel are committed to a war. And it's possible that in two years' time, there will be a ground invasion of Iran. But it's going to take time to build up to the ground invasion. And, but just because the Americans in the Israeli attack Iran does not mean they will win, okay? And the reason why is that, as you know from your research, in 2002, the Americans actually tried to invade Iran, okay? They had, they ran a simulation called the 2002 Millennium Challenge. And the idea is, let's pretend that we will invade Iran and let's see what happens. So they divide the military into two teams, right? Team USA and Team Iran. Now, if you know anything about the American military, you will know that it is the most dominant powerful military ever to exist in human history. It is crazy powerful. If the entire world were to get together and say, let's go fight the United States, the world would lose. The United States has the most powerful military in the entire world. And Iran, it's a very poor country. So the United States invaded Iran, and they wanted to see what would happen in a turnout that who won? Iran won, OK? And the reason why Iran won is the idea of asymmetrical warfare. And this is a very important idea that you must know if you are to understand this conflict. So what is asymmetrical warfare? Let's pretend that Jack and I are enemies. We hate each other and we're gonna kill each other, okay? Jack has armor and he has a machine gun. I have nothing, okay? So in most battles, Jack's gonna kill me, right? But let's pretend that I live in a dark forest and it's really hard to see in this dark forest but I've been living there for decades, okay? So I know it's dark forest very, very well. So if Jack attacks me in this dark forest, then it's possible for me to win because I can set traps, right? I can play tricks on Jack. And that's the idea of asymmetrical warfare, okay? Even though Jack is superior, because I'm inferior, I'm forced to be much more strategic in how I fight against Jack, okay? And so, asymmetrical warfare means that as long as you can define the terms of engagement, as long as you can control how the war is fought, you will win. So let's look at what this means for Iran and the United States. So the United States has these aircraft carriers, and they cost like a billion dollars, okay? They're very expensive, But they're very powerful. Now in a symmetrical warfare, what would happen is Iran sends its entire navy against this one aircraft carrier of the United States. And then what happens? The United States blows up the entire Iranian navy. That's what would happen. So you don't do that. You do not send your navy against an American aircraft carrier. What you do instead is you send drones, or drone swarms. So what they did in the Millennium Challenge was, they had these suicide boats, right? Charging these aircraft carriers. And guess what guys, if there's a lot of them, like a thousand of them, you can't stop all of them. And if one hits, then your boat sinks. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, that's what we call asymmetrical warfare. Now what's important to understand is that in asymmetrical warfare, you have to control how much resources you use. So for example, this aircraft carrier costs $1 billion. The drone's swarmed, a drone may be $1,000 for a real one, but then you have fake ones that cost $100. $1,000 are these drones that blow up, right? $100 are drones that don't blow up, right? You have 1,000 of these, and then that's like $10 million. And then you have 10,000 of these, and that's another $10 million, okay? So it'll cost you maybe $20 million to blow up a $1 billion aircraft carrier. Does that make sense? And this is why Iran would win a war, because Iran would employ, as a medical warfare, drone swarms against American aircraft carriers. OK? And the true promise actually showed us that the Iranians would probably use this strategy. And the reason why is that the total package, the strike package that the Iranians use costs about 10 to 30 million dollars. But how much money did they really spend to bring down these drones? Did you guys know? How much did it cost the Israelis to defend themselves against this attack? It was at least $1 billion. Hey, do you understand? So this shows us that in a war, Iran would use asymmetrical warfare. And even though Israel and the United States have military dominance, they may not be able to win this war. Okay? So does this make sense so far? Any questions about this? Okay, that's a really good question. And the question really is, okay, listen, the Iranians will use this asymmetrical warfare strategy against the Americans. And so shouldn't the Americans respond with more strategic thinking? And that's a great question. And the answer is the Americans will not do that. Why not? Why is it that ACM720 warfare is so effective against empires and dominant military powers? What's the problem of empires usually? What is the biggest problem? What is the fatal flaw? Okay, they have too much bureaucracy, but Iran also has bureaucracy. But the empires have a much bigger problem, okay? Now let's go back to the Millennium Challenge. Now in the first test, in the first battle, Iran won against the United States, right? So what did the United States do? And do what? They did it again. They did another second, they did a second simulation. And the second simulation, what did they do? Exactly. Okay. What the Americans said is, no, this is cheating guys. Did you understand? As of now warfare is cheating. You cannot cheat. And then the Americans won. Does that make sense? So remember, in the first instance where you are allowed to use HMW, they were in HMW. In the second instance, the Americans said, no, HMW is cheating. So you're not allowed to use HMW, you must fight us directly. And the Americans won. What does this tell us about the American military? Exactly, thank you. They are inflexible. Empires are inflexible, and the reason why is the idea of hubris. If you're an empire, you refuse to omit your failings and faults. You become very stubborn. So it's back to the example of Jack has his machine gun, his armor. He comes in the Stark Force making like, I'm invincible. And everyone's like, Jack, don't go into that dark forest. It's stupid. But Jack's like, no, I have a machine gun. I don't care. All right? So that's a situation. That's why asymmetrical warfare is so effective because it allows you flexibility and creativity. And the empire, the dominant power, refuses to be flexible and creative. Does that make sense? All right? And so the classic example of this is Vietnam, where the Viennese were clearly dominated by the Americans. But the Viennese were using extremely creative and flexible tactics against Americans. Whereas the Americans insisted on their main military doctor. Okay, does that make sense? All right, great. Okay, any more questions? That was a great question. Thank you. Any more questions before we move on? Okay, so now I wanna talk about, okay, And the Iranians are going to use asymmetrical warfare. What would it look like? And the answer is this. When the Americans invade, the war started, before the invasion, the Iranians must do four things if it is to prevail in the war. And this is what we call the Iran strategy matrix. The arrange strategy matrix means that from now on, everything we do must fit into the strategy matrix. It must accomplish the objectives of the strategy matrix. So the first thing it must do is unite the population. Second thing it must do is build alliances. And the third thing is win global opinion. And the fourth is weaken the enemy. Okay? So in other words, everything that Iran is gonna do from now until the actual invasion will be to accomplish all four goals at once. And it must if it is to survive a full scale American invasion. Okay? Does it make sense? All right. So you're not the population. What does this mean? It means that you win the war depending on how much your population is willing to resist the invasion. And it turns out that even though the Iranians right now are divided, okay, there's a lot of opposition towards the current government in Iran. As some of you know, there have been some protests over the past few years, women protesting for more rights in Iran, okay. So there's a lot of division in that country. But I think that most Iranians would resist an invasion. The reason why is that the Iranians have a very bad history with Westerners. So the example is the 1953 coup d'etat. So what happened is that in 1909, the British discovered oil in Iraq. It was called Persia back then. So they create a company called the Anglo-Iranian Petroleum Company, which we now know as British Petroleum, BP. And the idea is that this company would be responsible for extracting and selling all the oil. But unfortunately, the deal was that Iran, Persia would only get 16% of profits. They only got 16% of profits. So the Iranians are very upset about this. It's their oil, it's their resource, but they're not getting that much money out of it, okay? It's basically stealing. So for decades, the Iranians have been trying to renegotiate the deal. In 1953, the democratically elected government of Iran said to the British, listen, let's do 50-50. Okay, that's fair, 50-50. 50% for us, 50% for you, right? That's a fair deal. And the British, instead of saying yes, went to the Americans. And the British and the Americans together launched a coup d'etat against the democratically elected government of Iran and installed a police state called the Shah. The Shah, which is like the monarchy. And the Shah, the king of Iran, was so brutal that he created a police state. In 1979, the Iranian people overthrew the Shah. And so the Iranian people do not like the idea of foreign invaders coming in and controlling the resource. Does that make sense? So over time, as Israel and as America continues to be aggressive towards Iran, the population will start to coalesce and fight against the Americans. So that's united the population. Second is build alliances. Now Iran has two layers of alliance. The first layer is called the Axis of Resistance, which I ask you to research. And the Axis of Resistance includes the Shia militias in Iraq, Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas, and the Houthis in Yemen. Now, what's important to understand is that this is not an alliance. Sorry, what's important to understand is that this is an alliance. They agree to fight together because they have common interests, which is to remain independent of American influence. But that does not mean that Hamas, Hezbollah, and Hufiz take orders from Iran. They're not controlled by Iran. Iran supports them militarily and financially. But Iran cannot completely control their behavior. So the example is, on October 7th, Hamas launched an attack against Israel, which resulted in this war. And Iran says, we were not involved. And Israel says, that can't be true, because you control Hamas. All right? So that's the first layer of alliance. But what Iran needs to do if it is to win the war is also bring in Russia and China. Russia wants the United States to fight Iran. Why? Yeah, but true, to distract and weaken the United States. And also to move the attention away from Ukraine, right? Does that make sense? Because Russia is about to win the war in Ukraine. And if there's a war in Iran, then the United States will be forced to divert resources away from Ukraine into Iran, OK? What would Russia bring to the table? Russia would probably not deploy soldiers, OK? Well, what Russia would do is say to the United States, When you invade Iran, you are not allowed to use new tactical nuclear weapons, okay? You understand? Russia would say that, hey United States, if you use weapons, nuclear weapons against Iran, we will use nuclear weapons against you, okay? So basically Russia would limit the military options of America in a war, which would be of tremendous benefit and advantage to Iran. Okay, does that make sense? China needs to help Iran. Why? What does Iran have that China really needs? What does Iran have that China really, really needs? It really needs this. Chinese economy needs what? Oil, right? So basically, China can afford the United States to take over both Iraq and Iran, because then it can control the energy supply to China. Does that make sense? So China would involve itself over time in order to make sure that it's able to obtain oil from the Middle East. China right now is getting most of its oil from the Middle East, okay? But it will take time for Russia and China to get themselves involved. For Russia and China to get themselves involved in this conflict, Iran must prove two things. What are these two things? What must Iran show to China in Russia in order to get China and Russia involved in this conflict? If you're China and Russia, you're an investor, right? Why will I invest in you, Iran? Why? Exactly, okay? So the first thing is, we will fight. Second thing is, we will win, okay? So this will take time for Iran to prove this to Russia and China. And the more that Iran can show it can win, the more that China and Russia will invest in Iran, well financially and militarily and politically, okay, does that make sense? Okay, so this will take time. And the third thing is win global opinion. So how will Iran win global opinion? What's happening right now that's helping Iran win global opinion basically? What's happening in the world right now that is helping Iran win global opinion or why is the world becoming more supportive of Iran? What thing is happening right now that is outraging or angering the world? What's happening right now? What is your doing right now that is outraging the world? Yeah, Gaza, okay? So this is really important for Iran. It must maintain the world spotlight on Gaza, okay? Because what's happening in Gaza, it's basically genocide, right? where the Israelis are committed to solving the Palestinian problem once and for all. That basically means removing the Palestinians from Gaza. They can go to Egypt, they can go to Jordan, it doesn't matter, okay? But the Israelis want them out of Gaza, okay? And so this will go on for many, many years. And as long as the attention is on Gaza, then people will become much more sympathetic towards Iran over time. If you've been following the news about America, there have been major protests at Yale and at Columbia and other universities about what's happening in Gaza. And the last is weak in the enemy. So what does this mean? It means that when the United States invades Iran, two years from now, six years from now, who knows? But when it does so, it wants to build a large coalition of forces. because then it gives itself legitimacy. So this coalition will consist of NATO, Middle East countries, and Israel, Saudi Arabia, many, many countries. And what Iran needs to do is create conflict and dissent in this coalition. And the way it does that is by building up internal dissent. Does that make sense? There are many people, most people in America do not support a war against Iran. And so Iran needs to encourage this internal dissent. It can also create conflict between NATO and the United States, okay? Because obviously America will want NATO involve in its invasion of Iran. But why would French and Germany want to involve itself? Does that make sense? So these are the four major goals of Iran. And it must accomplish all four goals if it is to survive an invasion. So from now on, everything that Iran does will be to accomplish all four goals. and this is part of asymmetrical warfare. Does that make sense? All right, now let's look at a concrete example. The concrete example is operation true promise. Why did Iran design operation true promise the way it did? And the answer is to accomplish all four goals, right? The first is you unite the population. The idea here is Iran needed to show its population that Iran can strike back against Israel. Okay? So that's the first thing. Build alliances. Striking Israel is showing its allies and to China and Russia that Iran is willing to fight. Okay? Win global opinion. Now, what Iran said is we design the strike to not cause damage in Israel. And the reason why is it wants to win global opinion, If it throws all these missiles and rockets at Israel, and it kills a lot of people, then there'll be a lot of people sympathetic towards Israel. So the attack was designed not to cause any casualties. Does that make sense? And if you are an observer, you think that what Iran did was right, because it's a sense of fairness and justice. What Israel did was wrong, it attacked an embassy of Iran in Damascus. That's against, that's against international law. And Iran, to safe face, to pursue justice, threw some rockets at Israel, okay? So most people think that Iran's response was showed restraint and it was a measured response. Okay, does that make sense? All right, and the last thing is, weakening the enemy. Why would this weaken the enemy? Well, because after Iran attacked Israel, Israel wanted to show a strong response, okay? The reason why is that Israel has a policy of disproportionality. So Israel is committed to disproportionality. So what does that mean? It means that if you kill one Israeli, they'll come and kill about a hundred of you, a thousand of you, okay? If you throw one rocket at them, they'll throw a thousand rockets at you. And the idea here is deterrence, right? To make you afraid of Israel so you would not dare to think to attack Israel, okay? So when Iran attacked Israel for the first time, by the way, this is the first time that Iran has attacked Israel, then Israel was committed to a disproportionate response. Who stopped Israel from a disproportionate response? Who? Yes, why? Why would the United States say Israel, do not strike back disproportionately? Why would the United States do that? Yeah, okay. So the United States cannot afford right now to fight a war. And also, if the United States were to fight a war, it would have to do so by itself, okay? NATO would not involve itself. The Middle Eastern countries, like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, were not involved themselves either. So the United States had to restrain Israel. And so this is creating conflict between Israel and the United States. So that's why, so in other words, from a military dominance perspective, Operation True Promise accomplished nothing because you blew nothing up. But from an asymmetrical warfare perspective, you accomplish all your four major goals. And that's why the Iranians claim success. And you can make the argument that from a strategic perspective, it was a very successful operation. Does that make sense? All right, any questions about this? Anything you want to clarify or you don't really understand? Does this make sense to you? OK, so Peter asked a great question, like, this war, how will it affect us? We're going to the United States for college. We're trying to students. Okay, and the answer is this, okay? The answer is, in the war, there's something called rules for engagement. And so before they have a war, all the major parties agree on what the rules are, okay? So for example, you look at the war in Ukraine. Now, the United States and NATO are openly supplying weapons and financing and intelligence to Ukraine, right? But from the Russian perspective, we allow that, okay? We will not allow NATO to send troops to fight with the Ukrainians, but we will allow NATO and United States to provide weapons and financing, okay? Does that make sense? This is what we call the rules of engagement, the rules of war, okay? So the same thing would happen if the United States were to invade Iran. Before the actual invasion, there would be an agreement among all major parties, which would include Iran, United States, Russia, China, Israel, about the rules of war. And so one important rule of war is you're not allowed to use tactical nuclear weapons. Iran, you may have nuclear weapons. You're not to use them. United States, you have nuclear weapons. Israel, you have nuclear weapons. but you are not allowed to use them in this war. That would be the first agreement. Second agreement is that Russia and China are allowed to provide assistance in a very limited basis. China would probably provide weapons and material, but this will not impact the relationship between China and the United States. And during this war, China will maintain a precision of what we call strategic ambiguity. And all this is saying is that China is not going to say that we support Iran. Russia will not come out and say we support Iran. Never before this war happens, Russia and China could if they choose, sign a treaty with Iran saying that if anyone attacks you, you will come to your aid. They will not sign this treaty because they need to maintain strategic ambiguity. China and Russia do not want to be dragged into this war. Does that make sense? So my guess is that China will provide assistance to Iran but on a very limited basis and on a basis that the United States can accept. That's the first thing. Second thing is, listen, I'm just making a prediction that this war will happen. I don't know if it's gonna happen, okay? You understand? I'm just a high school teacher. I'm not making the decisions, okay? I'm just teaching you how to think about geopolitics. And third of all, when we actually in the United States, you'll find that there's so much anger at Israel that nobody cares about Chinese students. Do you understand? I mean, at that point, Most Americans will be extremely anti-war. It'll be like the Vietnam War where you have these massive, you have this massive protest and civil unrest because there were a lot of Americans who were against the war. And quite honestly, it was a pointless war. America accomplished nothing by fighting the war. So great question, Peter. Does that make sense to you? Okay, any more questions? Okay, great question, okay. So we talked about the idea of hubris, right? Empires have hubris. And so Israel is a small nation about eight, nine million people, right? It's not the American empire. The problem is this, the problem is that if you look at the Middle East, the strongest military power in the Middle East is Israel by far, okay? Israel does not actually need American protection. If the entire Middle East got together and attacked Israel, Israel would win because this happened twice before, right? In the Yom Kippur War and the Six-Day War. So military speaking, Israel is powerful. And quite honestly, if the United States were to retreat from the Middle East, Israel would dominate, okay? So even though it does not look like an empire, it's basically an empire. You understand? So therefore, it suffers from hubris. Okay? It's not gonna be strategic and flexible and creative. It doesn't have to be. Because it has military dominance over everyone. That's a very good question. Just because Israel is small, does not mean it is weak. It's very, very powerful. Any more questions? Okay. The question is very interesting. So is America constraining Israel? And you can make the argument both ways, okay? You can make the argument that American presence in Israel is preventing Israel from starting a regional war, okay? But you can also make the argument that Israel right now is using America to pursue a lot of its geopolitical interests, okay? Okay, so It's a very complicated question. Okay, but I think that I personally think that America is right not constraining Israel because Israel needs American support and that constrains the actions of Israel But if America were not around then it's possible that Israel So, unless it's the format of its military. And its military is very, very powerful. But if America were to lead the region, and I think Israel would become the dominant power in the region. But I think the same is true for throughout the world. If America left Europe, who would become the dominant power? Germany, right? And if America left East Asia, Who become the dominant power? Japan, okay? Okay, does that make sense? So I would say that the regional powers right now are Germany, Israel, and Japan. And it's an American empire that's constraining all three right now. And in America, we're just like to go back home and I say it itself, then these three nations would rise to the top. Any more questions? That's a great question, okay? So first of all, listen, this is all theory and conjecture. America has not expressed any intent of invading Iran. And if America does invade Iran, then chances are it will win the war. But in an invasion of Iran, if it loses the war, it would basically mean the end of the American empire. And the reason why is, if you look at why empires collapsed, it's because of three reasons. The first is the idea of extension, over extension. It's doing too many things at once. It's fighting this war in Ukraine, it's fighting this war in Iran, it's fighting this war everywhere basically. The idea of over extension, that's the first reason. Second is the idea of debt. It basically just runs out of money, because it's overextended. And this leads to the idea of civil unrest. OK? So the American Empire is heading into a lot of trouble over the next 10 years, because all three things are happening at once, right? Over extension, debt, and civil unrest. At the same time, the American Empire is extremely wealthy and extremely powerful. So even though America loses the war, there's still no peer competitor to the United States. But all that means is that the world will divide into different regional blocks, okay? Where maybe Germany controls Europe, Japan controls East Asia, Israel controls the Middle East. Okay? So more of a parallel world, okay? A multipolar world as opposed to a unipolar world where one nation controls everything. The decline of the American Empire is gonna take decades, possibly centuries. But we'll talk about this in future class. What will happen to America if it loses the war? Any more questions? Yeah? Okay, so that's a good question. Like, okay, the ground invasion. What will provoke it? And that's something that I want to spend a future class on. But listen, we've done a lot of wars. And we know that America doesn't really need a reason to fight a war. Do you understand? It can just make up a reason. It doesn't care. So basically, the argument that I want to make is that if Trump wins a presidency, then it's most likely that he will start a war against Iran. That's what I think. I think it will be Trump who initiates the war. And I think that it will happen maybe two years from now. So this is a very complicated question, OK? Like, what's the relationship between Israel and America? And the reason why it's complicated is that there's something called the Israel lobby. And again, we need to spend an entire class on the idea of the Israel lobby, because it makes no sense, OK? It's really hard to understand by itself. So I'll spend the entire class on the Israel lobby and then you'll understand why there's an alliance between Israel and America, okay? All right, but thank you, okay? Any more questions? So just to summarize, we will do a class on Jack's question. What will the war look like and what will mean for America but loses the war? We'll also do a class on David's question which is what's the relationship between Israel and America? Any more questions? We will, yes. We'll also be talking about the rise of Japan in Germany. All right, any more questions? Okay, great, I'll see you next week, okay?"}

Including Goblet-Tepet, Jericho, and kind of Hoiak. And the argument I made to you last class, which is the general scholarly consensus, is that what drove, what compelled the transition to agriculture was the religious beliefs of the people at that time, okay? So it was humanity's religious impulse that drove our transition into agriculture. What I will show you today, okay, my argument to you today is that this religious impulse, this need for religion, this need to understand why we are here today and what we must be doing and where we're going, it's always been there. In fact, religion is what makes us fundamentally human. And to prove this case, I'm gonna talk about Ice Age cave paintings. So I ask you to look at these cave paintings that we found all around the world, that go back 30,000, 40,000 years. And as you can see from those pictures, they're beautiful, right? And they're extremely creative, artistic. And so I want to look at three questions about the K paintings today. First of all, how were they painted? They didn't have the technology we have today, so how did they paint these K paintings? The second question is, why did they do this? Because when you're in a cave, it's very dark, it's very cold, and it's very hard to breathe. But they spend days in there painting them. So why did they do that? That's the second question. The third question is, and the hardest question is, what do these cave paintings represent? Or what do they mean? So the first caveat, the first thing I want you to be aware of is that there's actually no agreement on any of these questions. Cave paintings is something that we have a lot of around the world, but there's very little evidence as to what they are, what they represent, and how they were painted. So there are a lot of guesses, okay? And the case that I will present to you today is my own personal interpretation based on my research and my understanding of the evidence. But please be aware that there are many different interpretations, and the evidence is extremely unclear about many of these things. So let's start. The first thing you need to understand is that for most of human history, it's been very cold. So the Ice Age only ended about 12,000 years ago. And we've seen a general warming of the planet, which has allowed us to adopt agriculture. But before then, we're basically living on a very cold planet. Now, the history of humanity is this. 300,000 years ago, we came into being in Africa. But because the world became very cold about 100,000 years ago, that meant a scarcity of resources. And that forced us to seek food and resources elsewhere. And so that drove our movement into Europe, which then drove our movement into Asia, And then across the Bering Strait, remember this is all ice, right? Into North America and into South America. And then from Asia, we went down to Australia. So we basically colonized the planet. But there weren't that many of us. There was only about 1 million of us around the world 20,000 years ago. And the other thing to remember is that in this process, there were actually other human beings in other places. So the Neanderthals were here, and the Nesovans were here. And we intobred with them until we became the dominant human species. Okay? So does that make sense? All right, so that's the background. Now, let's look at some cave paintings. Because this is in the Chauvel Cave, and this started about 30,000 years ago. So these cave paintings were a continuous process where different people at different times went to the caves and painted different pictures, they might have added more things to the pictures as well. But as you can see, this is clearly representing animals, bison, renorsaurus. The other thing that's interesting about these paintings is that there's really no focus. You see lions, you see horses, you see rhinos. It's almost like nature is one interconnected picture. Okay? These are lions. Okay? This is Leco cave about 20,000 years ago. And the most, and a very famous artist, Papa Picasso, actually was invited into one of these caves. And he said that, wow, we learned nothing in 10,000 years. meaning that they were just as good back then as they are today. Artistically speaking, humans have not improved at all. So these are horses. This is Altamira Spain, which goes back to 34,000 BCE. You can see that they're not looking for a realistic depiction of animals. They're trying to imagine the natural world in their own way. So now the question then is, how did they paint these pictures? So first of all, they mainly used red and black. Red came from ochre, which is a type of clay, and black comes from a charcoal. So that's the coloring they used. a cave it's very dark so they had to use lighting okay so what they did was they got some animal animal fat but fire on it okay so they could see some of the caves but not all of them okay and then so now the question is why did they paint these pictures and a lot of clue is this look a lot of the clue is where we found these paintings. We found these paintings in a very special place in the cave. We found these paintings in the cave, a section of the cave, where the acoustics was the best, the sound was the best. So what this means is we're fairly convinced that these paintings were part of a ritual which included music because we found musical instruments as well, flutes. Okay? So in other words, we think that these paintings are like goba pe tepe, which is like maybe now and then these hunter-gatherers would come into this cave for a religious festival where there's music, dancing, okay? And they are watching these paintings together. So these paintings are part of a religious festival. In other words, these paintings are not about art. It's really about religion. It's expressing the religious beliefs of the people at that time. So does this make sense, guys? All right. Yes. OK. So I'm going to answer a question. What are the beliefs right now? Right. So again, no one knows what their beliefs are because they wrote nothing down. Okay. They are preliterate. We can't go back in time and talk to them. Okay. So we have to use our imagination. So let's imagine that we go back in time to this time. It's very cold and our memories have to wipe out meaning like we've lost the notch of today. We've lost science. We've lost what we learned in biology class. So my first question is, we're in this world, and what are things that amaze us or make us wonder or make us in awe? What are things that capture our imagination? Meaning we see these things and we're like, oh my god, God must exist because there's no way I can explain what happened. of these things that we would see and we would be surprised by, be marvel at, basically be an all-all. What are things about our life that amazes us? What's the first thing that we can think of? What's the first thing? You're in this world, right? You should imagine. What's one thing that's like, oh, okay, there must be a God or there must be some supernatural powers that govern our world? What's That's the first thing that comes to mind. How about childbirth? Childbirth, right? Does that make sense to you guys? Because I'm a father of three kids. And I can tell you, when I first saw my child being born, I was amazed because you have this life come out of nothing, right? And if you never study biology, you can't explain what happened. So that's the first thing that amazes us about being human, childbirth, right? What's the second thing that would amaze you if you were back here, yeah? Child growing up, okay, so child growing up, yes. What else? How about, yeah? Okay, how about the stars, right? It's late at night, and remember, there's no pollution. So you see out into the darkness, and it's all stars glowing, right? That's pretty amazing. So what do you think these stars are? You're out, you're out into outer space, right? And you see these stars glowing brightly in the sky. What are they? What's your own explanation really? To me? Okay, possibly, okay? Possibly souls or other worlds, okay? Planets, worlds. In other words, the first thing that you recognize is that our world is just one of many worlds out there. Does it make sense? All right? What else amazes you about the world? To me? Okay. Recovery from disease. Okay. So healing. Right? How do you explain healing then? What thoughts save you? Oh, the God save you. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. So there are some supernatural powers. But another way to explain healing, okay, is that you have a body and you have give a soul, right? And the soul could be one of the stars. So what's causing disease in this world is the soul and the body are in conflict. And so healing is about bringing the soul and the body aligned together, okay? And we think this because look at Chinese medicine, right? It's the same idea, right? With a soul and the body are in conflict, right? and you want to align it to you in order to heal. So other things that will surprise you is nature, right? The animals, the trees, the vastness of nature. Now, these are things that surprise us and they force us to ask the question why. So now let's try to construct a theory of how to connect all these things. All right. So we know that the stars, there's other powers out there, right? There has to be God or the soul of really great people or other planets or other worlds, okay? How does childbirth happen then? How does childbirth happen? What is the womb? It comes from the womb, right? What's a womb then? A portal, a door, right? So, what the womb is, is a portal that the soul comes from another world into our world. Does that make sense? Then how do people return to the other world? If the womb is a portal that allows souls to come into our world, how do these souls return to their world again? What do they do in depth? How do we, so people die and then burial, thank you. Do you understand? So this is symmetry, right? The soul comes into our world from the mother's womb, from darkness, and then for us to return the soul back into the original world, we bury this person in darkness and that carries that person back to the original world. Okay, does that make sense? Okay, so this is probably the simplest explanation for how life and death works. Okay, all right, so there are these portals, okay? And what in nature most resembles a womb? What in nature most resembles a womb? A mother's womb, like a cave, right, do you understand? A cave. So we can think that, okay, We humans come from a mother's womb, which is a cave, right? A tunnel. But animals also come from a womb, which is a cave, okay? So the cave is a portal into another world. So why are we in the cave celebrating animals? Why are we doing that? Why are we in a cave celebrating animals? What are we really doing? We respect what? We respect their soul. And what else are we doing? Because why are we respecting their soul? Yeah, we kill them, right? So we kill them. And now what are we trying to do? Let them forgive us. But what else are we really trying to do? Once we eat them, what must we do now? To me? Yes, bring them back, right? Do you understand? So we kill them. We think they go back into the spirit world, right? So now we have to summon them back from the spirit world into our world. Okay, does that make sense? So in other words, what this religion, what this belief is really saying is that we are all interconnected. And for every action that we make, we have to do something else to compensate for action. So if we kill an animal to eat the meat, then we need to ask forgiveness and then bring this animal back into spirit world to maintain balance and harmony in nature. Doesn't make sense, guys. Okay? So why is it in this world there's balance and harmony? Why do we think there's balance and harmony? Because what gives life to everything? What's the force that gives life to everything? The mother goddess, right? Mother nature, okay? And so if we think there's one force, the mother goddess that gives life to everything, that means that for us, trees, animals, us, are all equal. We're all the children of mother nature. We all have souls, okay? And so what gives us permission to kill other animals? Why are we allowed to kill other animals? The other animals are brothers and sisters, right? So what gives us permission to kill the other animals? Why are we allowed to do so? Okay, because mother nature, mother goddess has a plan, okay? Each thing on this planet has a function. The function is to maintain balance and harmony. If we do not kill the other animals, we will die, okay? But also, if you don't kill the other animals, there'll be too many of them, you understand? So in other words, the world is a cycle, It's a circle. And each person, each animal has a part to play in this. And as long as we play our part, then the world will be harmonious and balanced and perfect. Does that make sense? Does that make sense, guys? So we have actually a word for this religion. And this word is animism. animism. And what animism is, it's a very, it's probably the first religion, okay? And it's a belief that each living thing, whether it's a tree, a mosquito, a person, or anything that's living has a soul, okay? And we're all interconnected because we all have souls. And so we must maintain balance and harmony. And so many of the printed religions, okay, if you go to talk to native people in North America and South America and Australia, they all have this belief. But also there are many religions such as Buddhism which also has this belief, okay, and we believe that this is the first religion. Okay, so let's go over some evidence that this This is in fact what they believe. Okay, so a recent discovery that we made is that trees talk to each other. Do you guys know this? So what happens is that trees, there are maybe thousands of trees in the forest and their roots are connected through mushrooms, from fungi. And this allows them to share information. So for example, what we know is that if one tree in one part of the forest lacks nutrients like water, okay, the other trees will send nutrients to that tree. Doesn't make sense, okay? So it's almost like the forest is one big brain or one big living organism and they're all trying to communicate with each other. Another thing that we've discovered is that if there are pests or insects that attack one tree, this tree will automatically communicate to the other trees and these trees will start to prepare for the pests or the attack. The third thing, which is the most interesting, is that trees will recognize their own children. So if the children, these children trees, need nutrients, the mother trees will send the nutrients to the children right away. Does that make sense? So this is something that we've recently discovered. But if you think about it, if you're living back then, you can sense almost how trees communicate, because you're always in touch with nature. Okay, does that make sense? All right, this is a paint painting. And you can see that these animals, gazelles, they're going somewhere and there are two beings here. We believe that these two beings represent the mother goddess because as we discussed last class, the mother goddess comes in the form of a bird, right? The bird flies around the sky, the sky is the mother goddess, okay? So it's almost like the mother goddess is channeling or herding the animals from the spirit world back into our own world. What you also notice is that these birds almost like humans, okay? And so what we think is that the shamans dress up like birds in order to channel the energy of the mother goddess to control the animals. And there's actually a lot of evidence for this. So this is clearly an animal, but this is also a person who is a human being because of the figure. So these are human beings, shamans, who dress up like animals in order to better communicate with animals, but also to better communicate with the spirit world. And this is actually a more clearer picture of shamans trying to access the spirit world. Okay, are we clear so far? So from this religion, we can guess that the people back then were extremely compassionate. They believed that everything has a soul and every life is precious. And one evidence for this is this. This is a skeleton. What's interesting about the skeleton is that it's a dwarf. So there are some humans back then who are born with diseases or handicaps or physical deformities. This person is a dwarf. Now, this is interesting because dwarfs aren't able to contribute that much to your community. So as a hunter-gatherer, you need to hunt together to access meat, to get meat, to feed everyone. If you're a dwarf, you're not really doing that much. So in theory, because it's such a harsh life being a hunter-gatherer, you would think that they would discard the dwarf, kill the dwarf, or maybe leave the dwarf behind, okay? But from DNA analysis, what we know is this. This skeleton, okay, this person had the same amount of food, the same quality of food as everyone else. Meaning that even though this person was not contributing to the community, everyone worked hard to make sure this person was treated well and was fed as well as everyone else. And at the end of this person's life, he was granted a elaborate burial, okay? And we know this from the archeological research, yeah? Yeah, okay. Okay, does that make sense, guys? All right, so let me ask you this question. Let's make the assumption that he was, in fact, contributing to the community. How could he contribute to the community? How? They clearly thought he was special, but one made him special. If you're a dwarf, you can't hunt, what can you do? To me? Okay, okay, but what else can you do besides food? Why would they think he was a special person? What could he do that others couldn't do? Yeah? Thank you, okay. So maybe the religion back then is that everyone is special. Everyone's the same, right? So if you're different, it means, it doesn't mean you're less special. It means you're more special. It means that the monogat is, has given you a special power. And maybe this power is to communicate with the spirit world, okay? So maybe the key paintings, as you say, were done by people like this, who were in a constant state of meditation with the spirit world. And that's what inspired him to create the cave paintings. Okay? Because clearly, if you look at the cave paintings, they were done by a special mind. And if you are a dwarf, you clearly see the world in a different way. And being a dwarf, It makes the most sense for shaman, not only because people think you're special, but because you can invest the time into meditation, into religious practice, that enables you to communicate with the spirit of water. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay. And not only that, but what we found is that there are many burials like this. Okay? So this is a passage from the dawn of everything, which is a fantastic book, by David Grabber and David Wengel. They're both anthropologists. And this is a fantastic book. But this is a passage from the book. So Romans 2 is the dwarf. He goes back 10,000 years. And it was a pretty elaborate burial. And as this paragraph says, we know he ate exactly the same food as everyone else. like it was not discriminated against in any way. And the last passage here is, neither is rheumatoid and isolated case, okay? We have many examples of this. When archeologists undertake balsam praeces of hunter-gathered burials from the Paleolithic, okay, meaning the Ice Age, they find high frequencies of health-related disabilities, okay? So the people who are buried tend to be the ones who are disabled. They have some form of disease, which makes us think that maybe they're shamans. They were patriarchal shamans because hunter gatherers fought, you're different, therefore you must be special. Therefore the monogatis favors you. Okay? And high levels of care until the time of death, sometimes their funerals were remarkably lavish, which meant that they were prioritized by the community. They were highly valued by the people around them. Okay? explanation is, well, there were shamans. There were people who could access the spirit world and communicate with it. Okay? Doesn't make sense guys. Alright. Any more questions before I move on? Alright. Now, another amazing thing that we found about Ice Age cake paintings is that they have symbols. Okay? So we We saw pictures, but a Canadian anthropologist named Genevieve von Petsinger, she went on the world and she documented symbols in these Ice Age cake paintings and she found recurring symbols, for example, the hand, okay? The hand is everywhere. The spiral, the quadrangle, the circle, okay? The asterisks. Let me ask you this question. Why would paintings have symbols? Why would drawings have symbols? Why can't you just draw the thing? Why do you need to have symbols? Okay, so you're right, okay? So we think that this is a written language, okay? It's one of the first written languages, which meant that back then, they actually had the ability to read and write. Okay? So maybe this is a common language. What are some other possibilities? Why would you want to use symbols in a painting? Excuse me? To keep the content mysterious. That's interesting. To keep the content mysterious. And so where do these symbols come from? To keep the content mysterious, right? You have these symbols in their secret signs. Where are the secret signs from? I know, but where do they believe they got the signs from? Do you understand? OK, so another theory. Again, we don't know. No one knows. but let's look at different theories. Another theory is that this is the language of the gods. As you say, to keep the God mysterious, to give it divine or holy or sacred meaning. Does that make sense? What are some other possibilities? Yes, exactly. So this can also be a shorthand. We call this shorthand, but also there's some ways you can't draw. For example, love or energy or repetition or balance, harmony, cycle, these things you can't draw. So you have to represent them using symbols. So there are many different possibilities. Which means this, let's just summarize what the possibilities are. Why are the symbols an art? The first is that maybe you're trying to visualize an idea. You can't draw energy or life force or cycle repetition. So you just have to use a symbol to represent it. Which means what? Which means that each picture is a mythology. It's a story. Do you understand? The pictures aren't trying to show you a picture. They're trying to tell you a story about the world. That's why symbols are important. Because in a story, there are ideas that you cannot visually express. Does that make sense? That's the first thing. Second thing is that you're trying to visualize the language of the spirit world. So this goes back to making the cult mysterious. Why do we think this? The answer is this. We think that when they drew, the way to access a spirit world is to use drugs, what we'll call psychedelics. So in other words, there are certain plants that if you drink, it makes you see things. And the things they see are in fact the symbols, the geometric signs. So in other words, they went to the spirit world or they think they went into the spirit world and then they're just trying to express the language of the spirit world. Does that make sense? All right. This is a complicated idea, okay? But I want to introduce this idea to you, like how we perceive or how we understand reality. So for most of human history, we thought that, oh, reality was just reality. And we are just trying to see reality, okay? Reality is something that you must see. And then along came a philosopher, and he's a very famous philosopher. I want you to remember the name, His name is Emmanuel Kant. And he is considered the greatest philosopher whoever lived, Emmanuel Kant, German. And his idea is this. His idea is that reality is not something that we experience or we see. We ally is something that we imagine, that we create with our mind. An example he uses is time and space. The idea of time, like one, two, three, four, it does not exist in nature. It's not, it doesn't exist, okay? It's something that we, our minds made up. So our reality is something that we imagine every day. Okay, does that make sense? Now, what's really interesting is that Emmanuel Codd was writing maybe over 20 years ago, okay? And today we have a new science called neuroscience. Okay, neuroscience is the study of the brain. And what's really amazing, okay, and we will discuss this in future classes, is that neuroscience has confirmed a manual quote, meaning that we now know that the brain imagines reality, okay, it projects reality. Does that make sense? So what drugs do is they change the structure of your brain so that you see a different reality. Does that make sense, guys? So that's what drugs do. And so when they see a different reality, maybe they're seeing symbols. So that's the second thing about symbols in art. Now, the last thing is these symbols are mysterious. And mystery makes things sacred and divine. So back to childbirth. Childbirth is something that back then they couldn't understand. Therefore, they have to believe that childbirth is sacred and divine, and therefore, women are sacred and divine. Because only women are able to give birth, men are allowed to give birth. So back then, we believed that for most of human history, either we were egalitarian, meaning like men and women were equal, or women had more power than men. Only in recent history do men have more power. Okay? And how this happened, I'll explain to you next week. Okay? But just remember, like back then, there was no separation of sexes. If anything, women were considered superior to men. Remember, like the God is a mother goddess, a female. And therefore, women are more special than men. And they know this because women give birth not men. And childbirth is mysterious. Does that make sense? So we understand symbols and art as doing these three things. Now we have a more comprehensive or complete understanding of why they did art. The first reason is what they're trying to do is they're trying to visualize their mythology. They're trying to take this idea, their understanding of how the world works, their religion, and they're trying to visualize it, okay? So art is basically religion. There's no difference. Second thing is that they're trying to show to themselves how reality works, okay? They're trying to show that the underlying reality is a soul or God, okay? Does that make sense? Now the last thing, which is the most important, is they're trying to create a common memory and imagination, a language, a mythology that they all share together. And this is what we call society. Does that make sense? So in other words, the argument I'm trying to make to you today is, one, religion has always been there. since the dawn of humanity, okay? That's the first. Second thing is that religion allows us to communicate with each other to be together in society. So the third thing, the third thing is, religion is what allows us to be fundamentally human. But religion, we could not be human. We could not think, we could not communicate. We could not imagine. Doesn't make sense, guys. Okay, any questions about this? Okay, now let's look at a quote. Okay, what is religion? Okay, and this is from email Durkheim. Okay, and I want you to remember the name, Emanuel Durkheim. Okay, he's just as famous as Emanuel Kant. Emanuel Durkheim is considered the founder of sociology. Okay, so when you go to university and you study social sociology, guess what? You'll mainly be studying email darken. Okay. So this is what he says about religion. Religion is above all, okay. First and foremost, religion is this. A system of idea by which men imagine society of which they are members, okay. It's to create society and the obscure yet intimate relations they have with it, okay. Religion is a way for them to understand the world. Does that make sense, guys? All right. So let's look at what he says again in more detail. OK, so the great service that religions have rendered to thought is to have constructed a first representation of the relations of kinship between things might be. So what this is saying is that religion allows us to construct an understanding of the world. So basically, the first religion was this. And this is just a fear of the world. And this is important because from this theory, we are able to construct more theories. Given the conditions in which it was tried, that enterprise could obviously lead only to makeshift results, meaning that, OK, well, listen, religion, it's all about guessing. It's all about hypothesizing. So a lot of these ideas aren't going to work out. That doesn't matter. But then are the results of any such enterprise ever definitive and must it not be taken up again and again? So our desire to know, our curiosity, forces us to constantly reimagine our religion. Furthermore, it was less important to succeed then to dare, the fact that we tried what was important, what was essential was not to let the mind be dominated by what appears to the senses, but instead to teach the mind to dominate it and to join together what the senses put asunder. So as human beings, we're not trying to see the world or trying to imagine the world. That's what makes us human. Going back to Emmanuel Kant, our ability to imagine reality is what makes us fundamentally human. As soon as men became aware that internal connections exist between things, science and philosophy became possible. So from religion, we develop philosophy and science. In fact, you can say that science today is our religion. There's really no difference. It's just an understanding of the world based on our imagination and some evidence. Religion made a way for them. It is because religion is a social thing that it could play this role. To make men take control of sense, impressions, and replace them with a new way of imagining the real, a new kind of thought had to be created. Collective thought, okay? So religion is our collective consciousness. It's what allows society to come into being. If collective thought alone had the power to achieve this, here is the reason. creating a whole world of ideals through which the world of sense realities seem transfigured would require a hyper-exitation of intellectual forces that is only possible in and through society. Okay? It's only because we are together, are we inspired to come up with religion. So religion is fundamental to being human. Without religion, there could be no society. Well, society, there could also be no religion. Okay, you understand? So the implication of all this is that as a human, first of all, you are not alone. If you're alone, you're not the human. You're a human because you live in society. You're with other people. And because you're with other people, you must have a collective consciousness or an idea you share together and recall this thing, religion. Okay, does that make sense? This is clear to you guys. All right, any questions? Anything you and I clear about? Do you see how all this connects together? Okay? The cave paintings is what started it. Cave paintings is the expression of a religion. Then when the Ice Age ended, when we had the chance to settle down, we created communities to celebrate our religion. That's what gave rise to agriculture. Okay? And the religion that we use is probably something like this. Okay? The world is interconnected. There's a mother goddess that gives light to everything. Any questions? Anything you're unclear about? Yeah? OK, so that's a good question. So the question is monotheism. So the three major religions of today, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, they're all monotheistic, meaning they believe in one God. So this is actually a very recent innovation. Okay, so Back then they wouldn't have a concept of power hierarchy You understand they wouldn't understand that the Monica mother goddess is The greatest God of all they could only think like the stars right there's no hierarchy in the stars. They're over the place Okay? So maybe the mother goddess gives birth to our world, but maybe there's another god that gives birth to another world, okay? So they wouldn't think in terms of hierarchy. We think in terms of hierarchy today because of monotheism, but back then they wouldn't think so. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay? So maybe today you can think of a pyramid, okay? There's people at the top, but back then they would think like it's a river, okay? We're all part of the river. It's It's a cycle. It just goes in circles. And there's no differentiation or there's no power hierarchy. Things go wrong when there's conflict inside this river, okay? When people don't do things they're supposed to be doing. And these things are what? What are things that defy the mother goddess or go against the mother goddess? How about incest, right? about killing animals, about making the proper sacrifices. So you just kill the animals, but you don't go in the cave to pray for the return. So in other words, in this world, religion is basically ritual. And this is something that we'll study next class, how religion is just ritual. This happens in practices and actions. Any more questions? That's a great question, by the way. But monotheism is something that we will look at very closely in future classes. And it's very important because it's a basis for our society. Any other questions? Yeah? Yes. Well, you can't live in a cave, though. You can't live in a cave. You can only go there now and then. There's no oxygen in the cave. It's too dark. It's too cold. You can't live there. So you're right in that, OK, if a cave were livable, They could build farms around that cave. So that's actually a great question. Besides caves, what are some other portals in the world? What are some other portals in the world that have spiritual energy besides caves in nature? If you were back then, you would think that this place is special, because it both connects our world and spirit world. And these places would be mountain tops, right? Mountain tops. Guess what? Govley-Tepes was on a mountain top. Okay? Where else would there be portals? Rivers, okay? Rivers. Does that make sense? These are places that people would think are portals into another world and therefore they are special. And we find that when they settle down and build agriculture, they did so on mountain tops and they did so around rivers. Okay? Does that make sense? You can't live in a cave because you can actually live in caves. Does that answer your question? You can't live in a cave. There's no food. And it's cold. And it's wet. Oh, great question. Okay. Yeah. So they live outside in tents. No, no, you can't live in a cave. There's no oxygen. Any more questions? Okay. So your question actually makes me think of a point I want to end the class with. So today we think that we are either economic animals, economic animals or bilateral animals. So the person who introduced us, like who introduced to us the idea that we are economic animals is Karl Marx. And his argument is that we are driven by our need to have money, okay? And that's what we believe today, right? you're in school because you want to get good grades, so you can go get into a good university, and then you can go get a good job, okay? Now there are other people who believe that we are biological animals, and these are people called evolutionary biologists. They are inspired by Charles Darwin. So the idea here is that we are motivated by our desire to spread our genes, okay? So if I'm a man, I want to sleep with as many women as possible. Because if I sleep with as many women as possible, I spread my genes, right? But if you're a woman, you want to find a man who will be loyal to you. Because the cost of childbearing, childrearing, is very high. Does that make sense? So and we'll be discussing both these theories more throughout the semester. The argument I want to make to you today is that, no, we are first and foremost a religious animal. We have the fundamental need to understand why we are here. We have a fundamental need to connect with everyone, to connect with other people. But that does not mean that we are not economic and biological animals. They all interplay together. Do you understand? So what we'll see later in the semester is that you might have a religion, but this religion is not meaning your economic and biological needs, then you have to either abandon the religion or change your religion, okay? But we'll also know that the economic need is not enough. You also need religion. So there is an interplay between economics, biology, and religion. And that's what drives human history. There's something that we will learn more about next week, okay? So our next week. So yeah, any more questions? OK."}

We are doing monotheism today. And I will show you that the first monotheistic religion is Christianity. And monotheism actually marks an intellectual revolution in human history. And it really creates the conditions for modernity, okay, the lives we're living today. All right, so let's get started and I want to review Christianity and why it grew so fast. So if you talk to Christians, they have a very easy and coherent explanation for why Christianity would come to dominate Europe. Okay, so let's look at the Christian tradition. So it's called the Christian tradition, which is to say we don't have much evidence that this is It's true, but this is what Christians believe and what they tell each other. So in the Christian tradition, Jesus came from heaven to redeem humanity from our evil ways. He sacrificed himself and after he sacrificed himself, he started a new beginning in human history. He was resurrected and then he went before his apostles and told them to spread the good news, the gospel that he has come and he will return and then he will bring paradise with him. So there were 12 apostles plus Paul and they went all around the world to spread the good news. Paul became the apostle to the Gentiles which meant that he was trying to bring in everyone into the new religion of Christianity. To show their authority and to show that they are actually the true apostles of Jesus, they are all martyred, okay, martyrdom. Meaning that you know that they were telling the truth because they were persecuted. They went to India, they went to the Lava, they went everywhere to spread the good news and they interacted or they challenged the traditional religious authority, the pagans of that area, and so they were killed, they were stoned to death or they were executed. And after they died, the students would continue their legacy and these students would become head of the local church they set up and they became known as the bishops. And throughout all this time they were being persecuted by the Romans and by the Pagans. But because of their faith in God and because of the miracle that is God, they would eventually triumph and they would spread throughout Europe and the Middle East and Egypt until they became a very dominant force. Eventually the Romans said, if you can't beat them, join them. And the first Roman emperor to convert was Constantine. So Constantine was the first Roman emperor to become a Christian himself. And then a later Roman emperor would make Christianity the official religion of the Roman empire. And this would create the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is called so because Catholic means universal or the one and only. And the Catholic Church, with the Christian Catholic Church, you had a new idea called orthodoxy or right thinking. And then so one mission of the Catholic Church was to combat heresy or challenging orthodoxy to make sure that everyone stayed on the true path. And so this is the official history told by the Catholic Church and what Christians believed today. But as we discuss in our class historically that's what happened. Okay so let's go over it let's review what we discussed in this class. So Jesus I argued was a religious genius and he his idea would be what we call Nazism today, okay? And unfortunately, he got unlucky and he ran into the Roman governor of Judea called Pines Pilate. Pines Pilate had a problem. He was trying to enforce the imperial cult. The imperial cult basically just means to think of the emperor as God. And so think of a cult of personality. His pictures, his statues were everywhere, including coins. And the Jews hated that because for them that went against the religion. The first commandment is you shall have no God before me, Yahweh. You shall not worship false gods. And so Pontus Pilate was having a very tough time dealing with the Jews. He's throwing the Jews and the Jews said, well, if you don't get rid of this religious cult then you have to come kill all of us. And so Pontus Pilate had to back down. He lost faith. And he killed Jesus, he crucified Jesus as basically a middle finger to the Jewish people. Right? But because he did that, what he didn't expect is it would make Jesus into a national hero, a martyr. And so, his followers became called the poor of Jerusalem. Okay? They established a church in Jerusalem and they were supported by the Jewish leaders and they were called the poor of Jerusalem. They were led by Jesus' brother James, the just. These people will eventually become the Ibnites. This is important for us because the Ibnites will eventually spread to Arabia where they will help develop a new religion called Islam. So from the Ibnites, we will develop a new religion called Islam. The poor got along very well with the Jewish people because they just saw themselves as a branch of Judaism, as following the law of Moses. But in a manner that conformed to how Jesus saw the world, okay? Then you had a man named Paul. And Paul was a Roman citizen and he was part of the Roman elite and he had a problem. He was part of the Jewish diaspora and because of the religious fanaticism in Jerusalem, that was creating conflict between the Romans and the Jewish diaspora. The Jews believed the Romans were evil and eventually a messiah will emerge from their ranks from the house of David who will lead them in a final victory against the Romans. So Paul saw Jesus as an opportunity to basically divorce the Jewish diaspora from the Mosaic Jews, okay? That's why he created proto-Christianity. Because what he believed, what he taught is, Jesus is the Messiah, but rather than a prophet of war, he's a prophet of peace. And so he basically offered an opportunity for members of the Jewish diaspora to assimilate themselves into Roman society. If you consider yourself a Jew, then you believe in the Messiah, who return and fight against Romans. But if you believe that, then eventually Romans might come and kill you. Okay? So what Paul said is, if you believe in Jesus, you can still be Jewish, because Jesus was Jewish and this is a Jewish religion, but you will be part of the Roman Empire now, rather than part of just this very parental religion. But what's really important for us to understand is Most people refuse to follow Paul. Okay, very small minority people actually follow Paul. Most people who believe in Jesus were following the Abinites, okay? There's also other groups of people who believed in Jesus. For example, the Gnostics, which we discussed before. And also, you had these mystery cults. Mystery cults. Mystery cults were the most popular form of religious worship, which meant they were just like small groups of people who practiced the religion secretly. And what made these mystery cults special was their focus on group religious devotion and worship. And they were trying to achieve a sense of oneness, unity. They were trying to be Gaterian. They were trying to be anti-Hierarchical, okay? And what made them interesting was they used psychedelics a lot. They used drugs a lot in order to achieve a spiritual sense. And a lot of them start to believe in Jesus because Jesus could be easily incorporated into a religion. So you have these different early Christian groups around. But what we know is that eventually Paul's group, which again, is the smallest of these groups would eventually triumph. The question then is why? Why is it that Paul's church, which was the smallest of all these different denominations of early Christianity, why would they triumph in the end? First of all, the dominant group were obviously James the Just and the poor, right? Well, what happened was this, from 66 to 73 CE, okay? The Romans fought a major war with the Jews. And during this war, three things happened. The first thing that happened was the temple was burned down. Remember, the temple is important because it is the site of religious worship for the Jewish people. It's the equivalent of Mecca today. So when Jews in the diaspora, when they prayed, they prayed in the direction of the temple. Well, now you have a problem because the temple has been burned down. So now you have to redefine what it means to be a Jewish person. And as it happened, Paul had a new definition of what it meant to be Jewish person. You believe in Jesus as Messiah rather than make sacrifices at the temple. Second thing that happened that was very convenient for Paul in the Romans was, James and his group were wiped out. Not everyone was killed, but the majority of them were wiped out. Their denomination in Jerusalem was targeted and they were extinguished. So this is important because, remember, the major authority figure at this time is James the Just. He's the brother of Jesus. If he's dead, there's no more authority. Therefore, Paul can claim, as he does, to be the real authority. And the third thing is that's important is that it basically scares the Jewish diaspora. It scares members of the Jewish diaspora and a lot of them now see Paul's church as a very good alternative. They're afraid of what, they're afraid that the Romans might target the diaspora and so to show their allegiance to the Romans but still to, but they still want to maintain the Jewish identity so a lot of them start to join Paul's church. a great deal, okay, but an increasing number. This would just start one of three major wars between the Romans and the Jews, okay. There would be two more major wars and both wars, a lot of Jews would get killed, a lot would get enslaved, and this would drive more participation into Paul's church, okay. So a lot of Jews are now joining Paul's church because of of these wars. The church was seen as an escape mechanism for diaspora Jews from these wars. Does that make sense? All right. The other thing about Paul's church and why it became dominant is it mirrored the social structure of the Roman Empire. So the Roman Empire, the social structure is called the Pater Familias. And this is basically the idea of patriarchy. There's one man, the father, who is in charge of the entire household. And the household is basically a small empire onto itself. Okay, you have the immediate family, okay? So you have the sons, the children. You also have the free man. Okay, so these are slaves who are freed to work in the household, and then you have the slaves. Okay, so they were in charge of their own household, But they also had clients, okay? The client, the patron client relationship. In Chinese we call this a whole tie, right? So someone who would sponsor your business. And the goal of room society was to have as many clients as possible, because this gave you the idea of faith, okay? Or what in at that time was called dinatas, dinatas, right? Social prestige. The more clients you had, the more people who obeyed you, the more dignitaries you had. So the Paul's Church was a hierarchy as well modeled on the Pater family. So at the top was the bishop. And the bishop was in a church called Dachma, which is like how Jesus is to be understood. This is important because the problem with most early Christians is they were egalitarian, which meant that you could have your own interpretation of Jesus. But in this church, which is hierarchical, only the bishop or the person in charge had the right interpretation and you had to follow his interpretation. And this allowed the church to scale out into other churches, right? But much more importantly, after you reach a certain size, it made sense for the church to participate in the patron client relationship of the Pertor family, familyus, which meant that they would now invite a local aristocrat to become the bishop. And if that would happen, the local bishop would then convert his entire network and become Christian, right? And the aristocrat would agree to do this because it allowed him to more quickly scale out and expand his patron-client network. The church became a mechanism for him to expand his social network and political power. Eventually, Christianity would reach a point where it actually challenged the authority of the emperor himself. Because remember, throughout history, the nobility was always in conflict with the king, the emperor. And now that the nobility was able to better organize because of the structure of the church, the emperor saw it as a problem. So there were some local persecutions, not global, not imperial persecutions of Christians. There were some local persecutions of emperors because of the power struggle. But eventually, emerged an emperor named Constantine, and he had fought a very bitter civil war in order to reclaim the throne. And as we know from our history, from our reading of history, great kings always want to introduce new religions to consolidate their authority, OK? So think of King David introducing the new religion of Judaism, think of Augustus introducing the Inead to the woman people. So Constantine wanted to introduce a new religion to unify the empire and to consolidate his authority and that became the Christian religion. That's why he converted it to become Christian. So he began to sponsor the beginning of something called the Catholic Church. And guess what? He was the first pope or the head of the Catholic Church, the first head of the Catholic Church. But now that you have a Catholic Church, you now have the idea of orthodoxy. Orphodoxy. And that's a problem because, remember, throughout this history, there are many divergent forms of Christianity. And so the Catholic Church began a process of eliminating all its competitors until it became the most dominant. But the problem with Orthodoxy is that a lot of Christian history is made up. This is made up on the spot. And so there are a lot of contradictions. The major contradiction, one of the major problems in Christianity is, okay, Jesus came from heaven to sacrifice himself, right? So what is the relationship between God and Jesus? Like who is Jesus, real? And this is a fundamental problem in Christianity. It was a fundamental problem back then, and it still remains a fundamental problem today. So throughout this time, there've been different solutions, different theories proposed to solve this problem. What's the relationship between God and Jesus? There's also something called the Holy Spirit, which we haven't really discussed. But think of the Holy Spirit as the expression of God on earth. So when God wants to do something on earth, for example, he wants to move this table, he does it through the Holy Spirit. Okay, so the Holy Spirit is the expression of God on earth. It's what we interact with. When we pray, we pray to the Holy Spirit rather than to God. Okay, so there have been major different theories proposed to explain the relationship between God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus. Okay, so let's look at them. The first theory is called modalism, modalism. And it's the idea that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are the same being, but they are in different modes. So the metaphor is think of water. If it's really cold, water becomes ice. If it's really hot, water becomes vapor. Now, water, ice, and vapor are the same being, but they're in different forms. And that's the idea of modalism. Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit are the same thing but they're expressed differently in different times. But this is logical, but this creates a problem because if you actually read the Bible, you will see some passages where Jesus prays to God. That doesn't make any sense because why would you pray to yourself? So it's a theory, but it's not a great theory. Another theory that's popular is called partialism. Partialism. And the idea is that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are parts of a higher being. So think of the ocean, right? There's one ocean that covers the entire planet, but it has different parts. For example, there's a specific ocean. There's the Atlantic Ocean. There's the Indian Ocean, okay? And that's the idea here, where God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are just parts of a higher being. But then the question then becomes, then what is this higher being? So again, this makes sense. It's not a great theory. The last theory I want to talk about is the idea of Arianism. And Arianism was created by a religious teacher named Arius. And this understanding was, look, If God created Jesus, then that means God came before Jesus, which means God has to be superior to Jesus. So God is a higher being than Jesus. Jesus is still great, but God is the superior being. And again, not great, but it makes sense. So there's this huge controversy as to the nature of God and the nature of Jesus. And so what Constantine does is in 325 CE, he orders all the bishops of the Roman Empire to converge in a place called Nacea, okay? The Council of Nacea. And during this conference, they have to figure out what the nature of God is. So these are all the bishops from the various churches. And the four major churches of course Rome, Azzan, Judea, Antioch, and Jerusalem. And they're all there trying to figure out what the nature of Jesus and the Holy Spirit and God are. And this is the solution. And this is the solution that even today normally can figure out. But this is the solution. There are three beings, God, Holy Spirit, and Jesus. They are not the same thing. They're separate. They're not equal. Okay? We have three different entities, but they're all God. Okay? This is called the Holy Trinity. And this is the major idea underlying Christianity today. God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit are not the same thing. They're not equal. But they're all God. Okay? This is called the Godhead. So, let's sort of figure out what's going on here. Why did they pick this theory? Okay, first of all, what we need to understand is these first three theories, modalism, partialism, and erinism, are really stories. Okay? They're stories of who God is. This, the Godhead, is an equation. Okay? Now what's the difference? Well, in a story, you can personalize it. You can put yourself in the story and you can talk to God. And therefore, you can interpret the story the way you want to interpret it. And therefore, you can argue about the story with others. Right? That's what stories do. But you can't do that in an equation. Like, how do you put yourself into this equation? You don't belong anywhere. Right? This system is closed off to you. You're excluded from it. You can't enact with the Godhead. Therefore, you cannot argue here. You understand? There's no room for argument. There's no room for interpretation and argument. There's no room for debate. That's the first major advantage of the Godhead. You cannot debate anything because there's not another debate. You either accept it or you don't accept it. There's nothing in between. Second thing is before we understood faith as something that you experience personally, You can talk to God, you can feel God. But with a Godhead, it's something that you have to believe. You have to believe in miracles, which forces the idea of faith as blind obedience. Do you understand? Faith is something that you have to, before the Godhead, it's something that you have to experience for yourself. Now, faith is just blind obedience. You have to accept this as it is. Get to memorize it. It's like mathematics. When you go to math class, you're not asked to figure out why the proofs work, yet this is just memorize the proofs. And the third thing about the Godhead is it's exclusionary. Meaning exclusionary just means that you can't put any other theories in here. Now if you look at these three theories, moralism, partialism, and erroneism, you could actually put them together, okay? They're not contradicting each other. They're not fighting against each other. different, but you guys should put them together. Whereas with this equation, it's exclusionary. You cannot put any other theories into it, and you cannot put this into any other theories. And so what this means is this. If you put these three things together, something that you have to accept, you cannot debate it. Something that forces your blind obedience. Something that is exclusionary. It creates a new idea in human history we call monotheism. Monotheism. And this is a new radical idea in human history. Never before could we imagine something called monotheism. Before, there were some religions with one God, right? But this one God would also interact with other gods. Or this one God would create new gods. But the idea of monotheism is there's only one God, and that's it. And this is radical in human history. So let's try to figure out monotheism, okay? And by the way, monotheism, I think it's a very hard idea to understand. So it's okay if we don't really understand it today, but over the next few months, as we explore the impact of monotheism on society, we'll have a better understanding of, okay? All right, so let's look at monotheism. The first thing we understand about monotheism is, if we memorize this formula and you are forced to memorize this formula, Your understanding reality changes. And there's only one way to understand reality that makes this true. And the understanding is this. God is nothing and everything. Does that make sense? There's only one way that reality is structured that makes this statement true. God is Holy Spirit and Jesus, but God is not Holy Spirit and Jesus. the understanding of reality is God is nothing and everything, meaning God is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, meaning that God is all of reality. What this tells us is this, symbols become reality. The symbols of reality, the representation of reality becomes conflated into reality itself. And then if we do that, this creates three new ideas that become the underlying basis of modernity. And these three new ideas are capitalism, science, and the nation state. Before, we didn't have these three ideas, capitalism, science, and the nation state. But now we do, because we have come to believe that symbols are reality. We have come to believe that God is nothing and everything. So let's look at this. What is the underlying basis of capitalism? Money, right? So let's talk about money, because I think money is the best way to understand this idea that God has nothing and everything. So you and I go back in time. And we ask the people there, what is the basis of wealth in your society? And they might say gold or silver. And we ask, why is that the case? Why is gold and silver the basis of wealth in society? And they say, well, because gold is beautiful, you can make jewelry out of it. Also, it's very hard to get gold. If you go mind it, and it's very hard to mind it. And also, it's rare. OK? So you're like, OK, that makes sense. Yeah, gold can be the basis of wealth. OK? Now let's imagine some people from a thousand years ago, they transport to our classroom. And they ask us the same questions. What's the basis of wealth in your society? And we say money. And then they ask, what is money? And then we say, well, money are paper that the government prints. And then they're like, OK, but wait, wait, wait, wait. That makes no sense. because the government can print as much money as it wants. We're like, yeah, that's right. And you're like, and how do you trust the government? How do you trust the government not to print like 20 trillion dollars today? How do you trust government to behave itself? We're like, we don't know. And then why do you think money is valuable? You understand? So why do we think money is valuable? Because we believe money is God. Because money is nothing and everything. Because the symbols have become reality. You understand? Okay, now the question then is, why do we believe this crap? Why do we believe money is God? Why do we believe money is valuable? Because the power of monotheism is that it destroys other realities, okay? It crowds out realities. The first is that symbols become reality. Second is that it crowds out realities. Because before in human history, we believed there were many realities. There was a spiritual reality. There were many spiritual realities. And in those realities, money didn't really matter. But now, with modernism, we've destroyed those other realities. Only the material reality exists. But not only that, but for modernism to work, It has to expand until it becomes true. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, okay? So aggressive expansionism. Not only will it expand, but it has to destroy those who criticize it, okay? So in society, you are not ever allowed to ask a question, wait, what if money has no value because the government can print as much money as it wants? you are not allowed to ask this question. You are not allowed to think of this question. You're not allowed to imagine the possibility of this question. So that's what monotheism is. There are three main characteristics of monotheism that has enabled it to create the world that we live in today. First is it destroyed the idea of symbols. Symbols are now reality. Money does not represent wealth, money is wealth. Second is the idea that it has destroyed all realities except for the material reality that we live in today. You are not allowed to think of spiritual realities. In school, we do not teach the idea of a spiritual reality even though in our hearts we know it must exist. The third is the idea of aggressive expansionism. It is always expanding because only by expanding can it be true. And that's why the two major monotheistic religions of our time, Christianity and Islam, are so violent. They're the source of most major wars throughout human history. So we think capitalism, science, and the nation state are really good things. But why? Let's look at science. Science only concerns itself with the material reality. So you can't see it. It doesn't exist. But then this creates a problem because science refuses to engage in hard questions. Okay? One question that I think is very interesting is what is thought? What is consciousness? How do we think? And science, the response of science to all these questions is don't think about it. It's not a problem. And you're like, wait a minute. Consciousness is what makes us human. We can't figure out what consciousness is, then we will never know what it means to be human. And science's response is, a human being are just the sum of biological parts, right? You are just your brain and your head and your eyes and your arms put together. Because that's what we can measure. But the question of what is consciousness? How do we imagine things? How do we understand things? Science doesn't know. and it refuses to engage in this problem. One more point about symbols. So one thing that you're taught in school, which is not true, is we're so much more sophisticated than ancient civilizations. These ancient civilizations had these superstitious beliefs, like gods, like Apollo and Athena. And obviously, they don't exist. So the fact that these ancient humans believe they exist demonstrates how stupid they are. But here's the thing. If you go back to these societies and you were to analyze thoroughly how they understood Apollo and Athena and other gods, you would understand that they didn't actually believe these gods existed, OK? But they believed these gods were metaphors and symbols for forces in nature that could influence our lives. Does that make sense? So for example, take the idea of hatred and vengeance. Well, hatred and vengeance would become manifested in gods like strife and nemesis, nemesis strife. And the ancients believed this was a better way to understand the world. They understood that these forces were so powerful that we couldn't really control them. Therefore, we must be conscious of these forces and control them better ourselves. And unfortunately today, we believe that because these gods don't exist, they're just symbols, then hatred and vengeance don't really exist either. They're just states of mind. They're just emotions. And you can just pretend they don't exist and then you're fine, okay? The word we use for this is positive psychology. Have you studied positive psychology? It's a dumbest idea in the world, okay? It's the idea that if you think you're happy, then you're happy. Whereas the ancients thought that these were external forces and we have to work hard to tame them or to understand them. And I think the ancients had a much more thorough and nuanced understanding of reality than we do. Another idea that we don't have today is evil. The ancients struggled with the idea of evil. What is evil? Where did it come from? And what's a very popular book at that time is something called the Book of Enoch. The Book of Enoch explains why there was a great flood. Remember in the Bible, there's this flood that webs out of humanity, Onanoa survives. Right? So the book of Enoch tells a story of why God had to destroy the world. So after God created the world, his angels, called the watchers, saw humans and they thought that humans were stupid and evil. So they came down to better manage us. Okay? But then they started to lust after woman and they started to have children with these women. And these created giants, called the FLM, the Nephilim. Sorry, Nephilim. And these were giants. And so we humans just saw them as gods. So remember the Epic of Gilgamesh? Well, Gilgamesh was a Nephilim. And so we started to make sacrifices and pay tributes to these giants. But over time, these giants became more and more greedy. And so they start to devour us and fight amongst themselves. And so now God up in heaven, he recognizes his problem. So he creates a flood to destroy these nephrahem, these giants. So now they're wiped out. But because they are one of angels, they are immortal. And so they become these evil spirits, these evil spirits that roam around the earth. And they try to create chaos. There's one great king called Solomon, King David's son, and he discovers these evil spirits. And he captures them with a ring. But these evil spirits recognize that we as human beings are all flawed. So they tempt him with a beautiful woman. And Solomon wants to have sex with her, but she says, to have sex with me, you must worship my God. And so Solomon agrees. and it becomes controlled by these evil spirits. Now after monotheism, after the Catholic Church, they banned the book of Enoch. Because obviously if you're a powerful person, you don't want, you don't want, ordinary people thinking that you can be tempted by evil. If you're an evil spirit, you're gonna go tempt powerful people, right? Because it is the most advantage to you, and the powerful people are the most easy people to tempt. because it love power. So today we're not allowed to ask the question about evil. Where does evil come from? Why are people evil? You're not allowed to think of it. So monophysm is running out different realities and possibilities from us. And we live in a world that I think is, I think we live in a world that even though we are much more wealthy and technologically advanced, We are much less sophisticated than in historical times. So let me conclude by summarizing what we discussed and explain what monotheism is and the consequences on our lives because of monotheism. So the first thing is, back throughout most of human history, We humans believe that gods are everywhere. Every day we're interacting with gods because we believe in spiritual realities. So again, gods are metaphors. So this is premartic. This is modern. Now what do we believe? We believe that money is God. We search our lives around the idea of money. Why do we come to school to get good grades so that we can get into university? Why? Because we need a job to make money. Why? Because buying things will make us happy. That's what everyone believes. God is money. Money is God. And the consequence of this in our lives is, life is alienating. Think about the number of depressed people in the world. Depression is a new idea. It didn't exist before. Think about the number of people who live depressing lives, who are unhappy, who are angry, who just hate themselves in their lives. Okay? The second thing that we believe throughout most of human history is spiritual reality is real. Okay? There's a higher plane. There are higher dimensions. There are the spirits who roam in these dimensions. When we die, we will enter these spiritual realms. And therefore, we must prepare for entry into the spiritual realms by living spiritual lives on earth. Okay? Spiritual reality is real. Now today we only believe that material reality is real. And only material reality is real. When we die, we're nothing. We came from nothing, we live our lives, then we die, we become nothing. That's pretty depressing. So what this means for our society is facts matter more than truth. In school you learn facts, you don't learn truth. It doesn't make sense. In science class, you're learning facts. You're not learning truth. There's a huge difference. Facts are things that happen in the world. Truth is how the world works. There's a difference. You don't learn how the world works inside a class. You just learn things that happen in the world. That happen to be true. Now the last major consequence is this. Pre-modern, we believe that slavery was the worst evil. If you believe in spiritual realities And you believe that when you die, you will just ascend to the spiritual realm, then you want to live your best life on earth. You don't want to be a slave. But now, what are you taught? You're taught, dying, death is the worst evil. The worst thing that can happen to you is dying and death. Because when you die, you become nothing. So what does this mean? It means we are all slaves. We are afraid of dying. You can't live your best life. You're not going to take risks. You're not going to ask questions. You're not going to explore. We are all slaves, every one of us, because we are afraid to die. So you think about it. Monotheism is what creates the world we live in today and how it explains why we live the lives we do today. Now, what's important for us to understand is this is not an instant change, okay? This is something that will have to be fought over for about a thousand years because monotheism, this Godhead, it is such a strange idea that people refuse to believe it. This is a minority religion at that time. But again, because this is a religion that must expand, it will eventually triumph and and create the world we live in today. But only by killing millions and millions of people in these religious wars. So from the first day, from the day the Catholic Church was built, it was engaging in crusades and acquisitions against people who refused to believe in this orthodoxy. Okay, so I know this was a lot to take in, but are there any questions that you have? That's right. Okay, so I argue that we are less sophisticated than before because before everyone was very intuitive and very imaginative, meaning that they could imagine themselves living in different realities at the same time. There's a physical reality that you experience, but then there's also this high dimension of the spiritual reality that you could feel. So for example, if I were to fight with you, Okay? If we had a fight, I would experience that. But I could also see maybe this God behind me pulling my strings, and the God behind you pulling your strings as well. Okay? So when you read the Iliad, there are all these other realities that exist on top of each other. The reality that we live, but also a higher reality with the gods negotiate amongst themselves. And again, this is a metaphor, a symbol for the structural forces that govern the universe. Does that make sense? All right. So when it means sophisticated, I really mean much more intuitive and much more imaginative than we are today. OK. What made us lose the ability to imagine, right? OK. Well, it's these three things, really. Capitalism, science, and the nation state. Right? Do you understand? Because with capitalism, what it teaches us is that money is the only good, the highest good. So across other things, like for example, love of each other, interconnectedness, right? If you are a mother who loves your child, guess what? It doesn't matter. But if you think about it, the most beautiful thing in the world is a mother loving her children. But because of capitalism we're taught, that doesn't exist because you cannot financially exploit it, you can't measure it, okay? Then you look at science. Science is the ultimate religion because everyone believes it has to be true. It's objective. But what you will learn next semester, okay, we won't do this semester. But what we will learn next semester is the idea of objectivity, okay? Objectivity, it doesn't exist. And this is suddenly proven, okay? This is something that elite scientists know, but which we don't really understand. Objectivity doesn't exist. In fact, what elite scientists now know, and this is a very strange idea we will explore next semester, is the universe, reality. It is a collective hallucination. You understand? We'll learn this next semester. The idea is that the universe is what we imagine it to be. It doesn't exist on its own. Does that make sense? But we believe it exists on its own because of science. So when you go to science class, you think you're learning the truth, but you're actually learning a religion that hinders you from imagining other realities. And of course, the nation state. The nation state now is like God. Who are you? Well, you are a Chinese citizen. But before we did things like that. We just saw ourselves as members of a community. And it could be a global community, okay? And you could have many identities. But now, if you're a Chinese citizen, you're not an American citizen. Because you're in competition with each other. Does that make sense? So these are the three underlying ideas of the reality we live in today. And this wasn't true before. So this is a hard idea to understand, but next semester we'll become clearer and clearer, okay? Any more questions? Okay. All right, so good."}
